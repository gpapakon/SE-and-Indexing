<ABSTRACT>
The compensation device is used in an optical 
network where signals are transmitted from a main station 

(M) to one or a plurality of user stations (US1 to US3). 
It compensates for analogue optical signal distortion 

caused by laser chirp of a laser in the main station (M) 
which generates said analogue optical signal and fiber 

dispersion of the fiber link over which the optical signal 
is transmitted. 
The device includes a distance measuring device 
(R) generating a result signal (MS) indicative of the 

distance between the main station and the user stations and 
which is po
ssibly already available in the network to 
perform ranging when the latter network is also used to 

transmit digital signals from the user stations to the main 
station using Time Division Multiple Access. It also 

includes a processing circuit (PC) which in response to a 
given laser chirp and the result signal, provides a tuning 

signal (V) to tune the bias voltage of a varactor diode 
(VD) which is part of the compensation circuit inserted in 

the electrical signal path. 
In an optimal implementation the measuring device 
(R) and the processing circuit (PC) are located in the main 

station (M), whilst the varactor diode (VD) is located in 
each user station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compensation
device coupled to an optical fiber network and including at
least one tunable varactor diode which is tuned so as to
compensate for the distortion an analogue optical signal
undergoes when being generated by a laser and transmitted
over a distance through said fiber network, said distortion
being caused by laser chirp of said laser and by fiber
dispersion due to said transmission, and being dependent on
said distance.Such a compensation device is already known in
the art, e.g. from the article "Electrical predistortion to
compensate for combined effect of laser chirp and fibre
dispersion" by H. Gysel and M. Ramachandran and published
in Electronic Letters of 28th February 1991, Vol. 27, No.
5, pp. 421-423. Therein, the optical signal is transmitted
from a sending station to a receiving station, and the
varactor diode is tuned to compensate optimally for a
predetermined distance between the sending and the
receiving station. It is clear that whenever the
transmission distance between these stations changes this
distance has to be measured again and the tuning of the
varactor diode by means of its bias voltage has to be
adjusted to achieve optimum compensation.An object of the present invention is to provide
a compensation device of the above type where the tuning of
the varactor diode and the adaption thereof in case of
distance change or a change of laser chirp, is performed
automatically and not by hand.According to the invention, this object is
achieved due to the fact that said compensation device
moreover includes an automatic distance measuring device
providing a result signal indicative of said distance, and
a processing circuit which in response to said result
signal and the value of said laser chirp provides a tuning
signal for said varactor diode. Another characteristic feature of the
compensation device according to the present invention is
that said fiber network is a passive optical network where
a main station is connected to a plurality of user stations
via a common link and a respective user link, said network
being additionally used to transmit digital signals from
said user stations to said main station and including a
ranging device which determines for each of said user
stations its distance over said network from said main
station in order to schedule the access of said user
stations to said network for said transmission of said
digital signals, and that said ranging device comprises
said distance measuring device.In this way the
