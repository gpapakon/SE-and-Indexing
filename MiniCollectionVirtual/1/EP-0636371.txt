<ABSTRACT>
An antitussive containing a δ-opioid antagonist or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof as the active 
ingredient. It has a potent activity, does not give side effects such as impaired mentation, and can be administered 

perorally.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antitussive.Conventional antitussives are provided by mixing
drugs which variously affect central nervous system, such
as codeine and dextromethorphan. However, these drugs
have serious side effects such as drug dependence and
psychotomimetic, so that close attention should be paid
when using these antitussives.In recent years, antitissive effect of µ and κ
agonists of opioid is drawing attention. However,
conventional agonists such as morphine and codeine have
problems that they cause drug dependence and conventional
κ-agonists have problems that they cause aversion
and psychotomimetic. Under these circumstances, an
excellent antitussive free from psychotomimetic, drug
dependence and aversion is demanded.An object of the present invention is to provide a
novel antitussive having high activity, of which action
mechanism is different from that of the above-mentioned
conventional antitussives having serious side effects
such as drug dependence, psychotomimetic and aversion,
which is free from the side effects that the conventional
antitussives have, and which may also be used as an oral 
drug.The present inventors intensively studied to develop
the above-mentioned ideal antitussive to discover that
antagonists of δ opioid receptor have strong antitussive
effect, which have an action mechanism totally different
from that of the conventional morphine, codeine and
dextromethorphan, thereby completing the present
invention. Unlike the agonists of opioid, the δ-antagonists
do not cause drug dependence, psychotomimetic
and aversion, so that selective antitussive effect can be
expected.That is, the present invention provides an
antitussive comprising as an effective ingredient a δ-opioid
antagonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof.By the present invention, an antitussive of which
action mechanism is totally different from that of the
conventional antitussives having serious side effects
such as drug dependence, psychotomimetic and aversion,
which has a high activity and which may also be orally
administered was provided.According to JP-A-4342529 there is provided an anti-allergenic
drug containing delta-opioid antagonist as the
active component, having inhibitory effect on airpassage
hypersensitive accentuation and low in toxicity.According to European Journal of Pharmacology Vol
249, No 2, 9 Nov 93 p. 161-165, "Antitussive effects of naltrindole,
a selective δ-opioid receptor antagonist, in mice and 
rats" the effects of naltrindole on the capsaicin-induced
cough
</DESCRIPTION>
