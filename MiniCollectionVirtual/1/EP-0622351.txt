<ABSTRACT>
A new modification of Lifibrol is described with a melting 
point of 132°C - 138°C, particularly from 134°C - 136°C and a 

primary peak in an IR spectrum at a wave number of 3,200 - 
3,400, preferably 3,250 - 3,350. The new modification of 

Lifibrol (modification II) is distinguished in that it allows 
for good crystallization and, therefore, can be formulated 

without problems on a large industrial scale for tablets of 
acceptable size and high stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns the modification II of the lipid-reducing 
pharmaceutical preparation Lifibrol(INN), 4-(4'-tert.butylphenyl)-1-(4'carboxyphenoxy)-2-butanol. 
Lifibrol is 
a new cholesterol synthesis inhibitor which effectively 
reduces cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. Lifibrol, which is described in EP-0133935, is odorless and 
has a bad taste. At first, Lifibrol was obtained in the 
modification I form in which the active substance is 
crystallized from acetone, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 
or xylene. Modification I also forms through precipitation 
from alkaline solutions with the help of acids or through 
precipitation with a miscible nonsoluble medium such as 
petroleum ether from benzolic solution. The production process of Lifibrol should also be feasible on 
an industrial scale. For this purpose, the product must exist 
in a form which can be filtered and lightly dried without 
difficulty. Due to the intense adhesivness of modification I, 
the damp crystalizate is filtered with extreme difficulty. A 
single filtration operation lasts several days, which is 
difficult to tolerate in the scope of a rational Lifibrol 
synthesis. With respect to the production of a pharmaceutical 
formulation, there exists a particular desire for the 
development of a coated tablet. The necessary single dosages 
for clinical potency should be tested in the scope of dose-determination 
studies of up to 800 mg Lifibrol. This above 
limit is derived from pre-clinical studies. This 800 mg 
Lifibrol dosage should be realized by the dosage of one single 
coated tablet. In this regard, one is orientated, among other 
things, by the contents of active substance per drug of the 
lipid-reducing pharmaceutical already found on the market, 
which is to be drawn from Table 1.
