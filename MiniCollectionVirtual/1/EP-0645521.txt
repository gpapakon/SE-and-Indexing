<ABSTRACT>
Liquid ring gas pump with a working space in which an impeller (6) revolves and which is bounded axially by a control plate (7) past which the impeller (6) moves with a small clearance and which has at least one intake and/or one discharge opening (21, 22, 23) and is made of rolled sheet. According to the invention, the edges (26) of the intake or discharge opening are at least in part bent over towards the side facing away from the impeller (6) and are rounded on the side facing the impeller and raised on the side facing away from it.

<CLAIMS>
A liquid ring gas pump with a working chamber, in 
which an impeller (6) rotates and which is bounded axially 

by a control plate (7) past which the impeller (6) passes at 
a small distance and which has at least one suction opening 

and/or pressure opening (21,22,23) and which is formed of 
rolled sheet, characterised in that the edges (26) of the 

suction opening and pressure opening are bent over at least 
partly towards the side remote from the impeller (6) and are 

rounded on the side facing the impeller and are formed 
raised on the side remote therefrom. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the rolled sheet forming the control 

plate is not more than 4 mm thick. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the rolled sheet forming the control 

plate is approximately 2.5 to 3.5 mm thick. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the permanently open 

pressure opening (22) has on that opening side (31) which is 
reached first by the vanes of the impeller (6) a bent 

portion (32) partly covering the opening on the side remote 
from the impeller (6). 
A liquid ring gas pump according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the bent portion (32) forms a 

depression with respect to the working chamber. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the control plate (7)  

 
includes one or more pressure openings (23) co-operating 

with valve members (27), wherein the valve seat for the 
valve members (27) is formed respectively by the bent-over 

edge of the pressure openings (23). 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that in addition to the 

permanently open pressure opening (22) the control plate (7) 
includes one or more pressure openings (23) co-operating 

with valve members (27), wherein the valve seat for the 
valve members (27) is formed by a component (28) which is 

mounted with the control plate in the vicinity of these 
openings (23) and which braces the control plate. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the component (28) has a projection 

(24) which extends at a distance from the impeller (6) over 
the portion (31) of the permanently open pressure opening 

(22) which is reached first by the vanes of the impeller. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that a groove (35) to 

accommodate an 0-ring (36) is pressed into the peripheral 
region of the control plate (7) which co-operates with an 

adjoining housing part (4,5). 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the outer rim (37) of 

the control plate (7) is crimped over. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the control plate (7) 

has reinforcing beads (39,40,41,44) in the region which is 
adjacent to the impeller hub (16). 
A liquid ring gas pump according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that the beads (39) extend radially.  

 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the control plate (7) 

has a bore (46) for the passage of a shaft and the rim (47) 
of which is bent over and raised on one side. 
A liquid ring gas pump according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 13, characterised in that adjacent the impeller 

hub (16) the control plate (7) has a circular bead (44) as a 
seating for a bearing ring (45). 
A method of producing a control plate according to 
any one of Claims 1 to 14, characterised in that they are 

formed from rolled sheet without removal of material.
