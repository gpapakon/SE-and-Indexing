<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing highly dispersed (finely divided) silica and an apparatus for carrying out the process. The process for preparing highly dispersed silica by reaction of gaseous or vaporisable silicon compounds in admixture with gases which burn to form water and air or oxygen in a flame is characterised in that discharges of gas are generated in the combustion chamber by means of at least one gas gun. The apparatus for carrying out this process is characterised in that at least one gas gun (2a, 2b, 2c) is positioned at the outside of the combustion chamber wall and produces a discharge of gas via an opening in the combustion chamber wall, preferably in combination with a nozzle at the inside of the combustion chamber wall.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing finely divided silica by 
reaction of gaseous or vaporizable silicon compounds in 

a mixture with gases forming water on combustion and air 
or oxygen in a flame, character
ized in that discharges of 
gas are produced in the combustion chamber by means of at 

least one gas gun. 
Process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein 3 or 4 gas 
guns are used. 
Process as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
gas gun is used in conjunction with a nozzle on the 

inside of the combustion chamber wall. 
Process as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the nozzle 
effects a reversal of the gas coming out of the gas gun 

by from 90 to 110 degrees. 
Process as claimed in one or more of Claims 1 to 
4, wherein 3 or 4 discharges of gas per hour and gas gun 

are produced.
