<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides stabilized aqueous liquid formulations having phytase activity which exhibit increased resistance to heat inactivation of the enzyme activity and which retain their phytase activity during prolonged periods of storage. The liquid formulations are stabilized by means of the addition of urea and/or a polyol such as sorbitol and glycerol as stabilizing agent. Also provided are feed preparations for monogastric animals and methods for the production thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
 STABILIZED AQUEOUS LIQUID FORMULATIONS OF PHYTASEThe present invention relates to liquid formulations of enzyme activities and in particular, aqueous liquid formulations containing phytase activity.Background of the InventionBecause of their ease in handling, liquid formulations of enzymes are in many cases easier to use in industrial applications, such as in the preparation of animal feeds. However, it is often true that enzymes in liquid formulations are not stable and suffer from inactivation during prolonged storage or by exposure to high temperature. T h i s s especially true of non-purified solutions of enzymes which are directly obtained from a fermentation broth after subsequent filtration and ultra-filtration. Ultra-filtered fermentation broths are often preferred to purified enzyme solutions since purification often leads to a significant decrease in overall enzyme activity yield and furthermore, a great deal of the production costs arise from purification processes. For many industrial applications, a purified enzyme preparation is simply not necessary.Ultra-filtrates of fermentation broths containing the enzyme phytase may, for example, be directly applied to the diets of monogastric animals in order to release inorganic phosphorous from the anti-nutritional factor phytate, thus avoiding the necessity of adding phosphorous to the feed and consequently lowering the amount of phosphorous found in the excreta of the ingesting animal, an obvious benefit for the environment (see European Patent Application 420,358 and U.S. Patent 3,297,548) . Since phytase is applied to the animal diets in lieu of added phosphorous, it is necessary to ensure that the enzyme is homogenously applied to the feed in order to provide the animal ingesting the feed with its required amount of dietary phosphorous. A liquid formulation of the phytase enzyme would 

thus be advantageous since it may be evenly applied via a means such as spraying, thus providing a homogenous feed product.U.S. Patent 3,297,548 does in fact mention liquid preparations of phytase, wherein said liquid form of the phytase enzyme is prepared from a concentrate of the enzyme obtained by heating a filtered fermentation broth at 55-70*C under vacuum.However, it has been observed that the exposure of aqueous phytase-containing fermentation broth ultra-filtrates to temperatures in excess of 45Â°C leads to the rapid inactivation of the enzyme activity (see Figure 1) .It would thus be beneficial to obtain a stabilized aqueous liquid formulation
