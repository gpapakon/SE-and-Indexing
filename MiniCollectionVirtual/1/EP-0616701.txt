<ABSTRACT>
Photocurable cyclobutarene compositions having a low dielectric constant, low moisture uptake, enhanced oxidative stability, good processability, good planarization, and a long shelf life are disclosed. These polymer compositions are useful in composites, laminates, membranes, films, adhesives, coatings, and electronic applications such as multichip modules and printed circuit boards. An example of such photocurable cyclobutarene compositions is a mixture of a photosensitive agent such as 2,6-bis(4-azidobenzylidene)-4-methylcyclohexanone and a cyclobutarene such as oligomeric divinyltetramethyldi-siloxane bisbenzocyclobutane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photocurable organic-soluble mixture comprising at least one oligomerized cyclobutarene.Such polymers are used in passivation films, photoresists, as insulating layers in
fabricating electrical devices and as protective films for semiconductor elements.Thermal- and/or photo-cured polyimides, which are currently used in many of
these applications, have drawbacks, some of which include: a short shelf life, less than desirable
thermal oxidative stability, microcracking during thermal cycling, and lack of processability
including a high degree of volatile release.Other examples of known light sensitive compositions include the following. US-A-4,243,743 discloses a composition comprising a poly(amic acid), an organic
compound having a photosensitive olefinic double bond and an amino group or a quarternary
ammonium salt, and Michler's ketone. US-A-4,321,319 discloses a composition
comprising a poly(amic acid) having a photosensitive olefinic double bond, Michler's ketone,
nitrofluorene, and 5-nitroacenaphthalene. US-A-4,366,230 discloses a composition
comprising a modified poly(amic acid) obtained by introducing a methacryl or acryl group into
the ester residue of the poly(amic) acid and Michler's ketone. The compositions disclosed in
these three patents produce less than desirable results since a portion of the compositions
exposed to light is released when solvent developed and cured.From EP-A-527 572 benzocyclobutene resin films are known by
polymerization of bisbenzocyclobutene monomer in the presence of an
unsaturated compound having a higher dienophilic activity than the
bisbenzocyclobutene monomer so that an adduct is formed. The
polymerization degree of the bisbenzocyclobutene monomer can be
controlled by this adduct. The polymerization can be accelerated by
UV-irradiation in a nitrogen/oxygen mixed gas atmosphere to give a cured
film of 100 % conversion in a shorter time.It would be desirable to have photocurable polymers with one or more improved
physical properties or improved combinations of physical properties, compared to the
aforementioned polymers. Some of these properties include a low dielectric constant, a low
dissipation factor, low moisture uptake, high sensitivity, high contrast, high resolution, thermal
stability, enhanced oxidative stability, resistance to chemicals and plasmas, good adhesion, low
release of volatiles, good processability, good planarization, a long shelf life, consistency
control, high purity, and low cost. This object is attained by an a
