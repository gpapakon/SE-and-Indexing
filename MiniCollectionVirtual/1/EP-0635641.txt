<ABSTRACT>
A fan and fan drive assembly (11) is disclosed of the type including a 
fan drive (13) and a fan assembly (15). The fan drive (13) includes a body 

member (21) and a cover member (23), one of the members comprising a 
die-cast member and including a connecting portion (65;165;201) having a 

terminal portion (67,69;102;267,269). The fan (15) comprises a one-piece 
molded plastic member, and during the molding step, whichever of the body 

and cover defines the connecting portion is disposed within the molding die 
(M). The terminal portion of the connecting portion is disposed within a hub 

cavity (H), so that, when the moldable plastic material is injected into the hub 
cavity, it forms the fan hub (61) about, and rigidly connected to, the terminal 

portion of the connecting portion. As a result, there is no need to bolt a fan 
assembly to the fan drive, thus eliminating the tapping of internally threaded 

holes in the body or cover of the fan drive, and eliminating the expense of 
bolts and the assembly time for bolting the fan to the fan drive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assembly of a fluid coupling device and a fan, and 
more particularly, to an improved arrangement for attaching a fan to a fluid coupling 
device, as well as an improved method for such attachment. It will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the subsequent description that 
the mounting arrangement of the present invention may be utilized advantageously with 
various types of fans, as well as with various types of fluid coupling devices. However, 
the invention is especially useful for attaching a radiator cooling fan for cooling a 
vehicle engine to a viscous fan drive, and the invention will be described in connection 
therewith. The invention is also especially useful when the fan is of the type having a 
hub portion and fan blades molded integrally therewith from a plastic material. 
Furthermore, the invention is especially useful when the fluid coupling device is of the 
type in which either the body member or the cover member comprises a die-cast 
member, and preferably, a die-cast aluminum member. The fluid coupling device (viscous fan drive) is now well known to those skilled in the 
art, an example of which is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,974,712. Conventionally, the 
fluid coupling device is manufactured separate from the fan assembly, and they are 
brought together for the first time at, for example, the engine assembly plant. A fan and fan drive assembly known from GB-A-1 256 039 includes a fan comprising 
an annular hub and a plurality of fan blades formed integrally with this hub. The hub 
and the fan blades are formed of plastic material. The fan drive assembly further 
includes a fan drive comprising an input member, an output assembly and means 
operable to transmit torque from the input member to the output assembly in response to 
rotation of the input member. The output assembly comprises a body member and a cast 
cover member. Both these members have the same nominal outside diameter. A radially 
outer portion of an annular metal member is fixed by rivets to a flange of the hub of the 
fan, whereas a radially inner portion of this metal member is attached by studs and nuts 
to the output assembly. In a similar fan and fan drive assembly known from DE-A-1 628 386 the fan blades, the 
annular hub carrying these blades and the cover member of the output assembly are 
integrally connected with each other. The typical fan assembly of the type used with a viscous fan drive comprises a stamped, 
sheet metal connecting member, with the fan
