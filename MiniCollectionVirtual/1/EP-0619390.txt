<ABSTRACT>
In order to obtain an oblique shed, there are provided, for driving the belts (7) bearing the knives (9) for actuating the hooks (5a) of the modules (5), drums (6) whose diameters decrease from one end of the loom to the other. The driving of the drums (6) is achieved with the aid of two longitudinal connecting rods (10) with oscillating (to-and-fro) movement.

<CLAIMS>
A JACQUARD mechanism, of the type in which the 
blades (9) which are intended to actuate the rows of 

hooks (5a) associated with the harnesses are borne by 
the parallel strands of a series of funicular elements 

or belts (7) driven by drums (6) moved in an 
alternating movement, characterised in that the drums 

(6) are constructed with diameters which decrease from 
one end of the mechanism to the other in order to 

impart to the hooks (5a) differentiated strokes which 
enable an oblique shed to be obtained. 
A mechanism according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the alternate rotation of the drums (6) is 

effected by means of one and the same longitudinal 
element (10) which is driven in an oscillating movement 

and is connected to each of the drums to be driven. 
A mechanism according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the longitudinal element is formed by a 

connecting-rod (10) attached (at 11) to each of the 
corresponding drums, and associated with a drive 

mechanism of the connecting-rod-(13)-and-eccentric (14) 
type. 
A mechanism according to any one of Claims 2 to 3, 
characterised in that the drums (6) are arranged in 

pairs to form two symmetrical longitudinal rows, one 
longitudinal drive element (10) being accommodated 

between the two drums of the pairs of one and the same 
row.
