<ABSTRACT>
A magnet assembly comprises a pair of substantially aligned, spaced apart first magnets (1, 2) having like poles facing each other. A second magnet (3) is positioned adjacent the space between the first magnets with its magnetic axis transverse to the alignment axis of the first magnets (1, 2). A magnetic field of sufficient homogeneity to perform a nuclear magnetic resonance process is generated in a working region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnet assembly for
generating a magnetic field of sufficient homogeneity to
perform a NMR process in a working region.Magnet assemblies for generating homogeneous fields
for the purposes of NMR are well known in a variety of
fields but the present invention is particularly concerned,
although not exclusively, with well logging applications.
In these applications, the working region must be
positioned outside the magnet assembly and in the
surrounding rock in order to obtain NMR information from
the rock. An early system of this type is described in US-A-4350955.In this arrangement, a pair of axially opposed magnets
produce a radial field which has a maximum value and a
region of uniformity over an annular volume whose radius is
determined by the separation of the magnets. A variation
on this scheme is described in WO-A-92/07279 whereby the
volume of the homogeneous region is increased to improve
the sensitivity of the NMR measurement.These and similar systems are cylindrically symmetric.
In some circumstances it may be desirable to deploy a well-logging
instrument which takes the form of a "pad tool".
These circumstances are, for example, when the size of the
hole is much greater than the diameter of the tool, or when
the hole is grossly irregular in section, and it is desired
to exclude the response of the drilling fluid. Such a pad
tool has been described in US-A-4,933,638. The type of
magnet system described in this has the drawback that the
"throw" (i.e. the distance from the apparatus to the
sensitive region) and the dimensions of the sensitive
region have to be small compared to the dimensions of the
magnet system in the transverse plane. This restricts the
usefulness of this system. EP-A-0371775 discloses a magnetic assembly for
creating a uniform magnetic field. The magnetic assembly
comprises two main magnets which are axially aligned with
opposite poles facing each other. The pole pieces affixed
to the front of each magnet with a series of adjusting
magnets positioned round the pole pieces such that a
uniform field is generated in a region between the two
first magnets.US-A-4717876 shows a magnet assembly comprising first
magnets positioned with like poles facing each other. This
results in a working region suitable for NMR experiments
being carried out being generated symmetrically about an
axis along which the two first magnets are arranged.In accordance with the present invention, a magnet
assembly comprises a pair of substantially aligned, spaced
apart first
