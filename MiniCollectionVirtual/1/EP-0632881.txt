<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of determining extension in one direction in an object (12) by means of an extensometer with two limbs (3). Both limbs are connected at one end to a hinge (7), can move in the plane, and are connected at the other end to the object (12), so that the limbs (3) are forced apart by the extension. According to the invention, the extension is aligned to be roughly parallel to one surface of the object (12) between the other ends of the limbs (3). The invention further concerns the application of the method, for example for monitoring a crack (13) in the object (12), as well as an extensometer for carrying out the process. The extensometer is preferably a capacitance extensometer with two capacitor plates (1, 2) configured essentially in parallel, with one capacitor plate (1, 2) on each limb (3). The extension is determined by measuring the capacitance of the capacitor system formed by the capacitor plates (1, 2).

Method for determining an extension of an object 
(12) by means of an extensometer having two legs (3) 

which are each connected at one end to a joint (7) and 
are movable in a spreading plane and which are each connected 

at the other end to the object (12), so that the 
extension spreads the legs (3) apart, the spreading plane 

being oriented approximately parallel to a surface of the 
object (12) between the other ends of the legs (3), each 

leg (3) carrying a foot bracket (8) which is oriented in 
the spreading plane and which has a region projecting 

beyond the other end of the leg (3) and is fastened to 
the object (12) at this region. 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein each leg (3) 
is connected, preferably welded, to the object (12) at an 

essentially spot-shaped connection point (11). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein each 
leg (3) is connected to the object (12) by spot welding. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
wherein a capacitance, dependent on the spreading of the 

legs (3), of a capacitor arrangement (1, 2) fastened to 
the legs (3) is measured in order to determine the 

extension. 
Use of the method according to one of Claims 1 to 
4 for monitoring a crack (13) in the object (12), the 

crack (13) being bridged by the extensometer, and the 
extension caused by the growth of the crack (13) being 

determined. 
Use according to Claim 5 or use of the method 
according to one of Claims 1 to 4, the object (12) being 

a fracture sample.  
 
Extensometer for determining an extension of an 
object (12), having two legs (3) which are each connected 

at one end to a joint (7) and are movable in a spreading 
plane and which are each to be connected at the other end 

to the object (12), so that the extension spreads the 
legs (3) apart, characterized in that each leg (3) 

carries a foot bracket (8) which is oriented in the 
spreading plane and which has a region projecting beyond 

the other end of the leg (3) and is to be fastened to the 
object (12) at this region. 
Extensometer according to Claim 7, wherein the 

inner edge of each foot bracket (8) directed towards the 
respective other leg (3) butts onto a longitudinal edge 

of the leg (3) to which it is fastened. 
Extensometer according to Claim 7 or 8, wherein, 
in the non-loaded state, the legs (3) are oriented at 

least approximately parallel to one another. 
Extensometer according to one of Claims 7 to 9, 
wherein the joint (7) is a flexible link (7). 
Extensometer according to one of Claims 7 to 10, 
wherein a capacitor arrangement (1, 2) having a capacitance 

dependent on the spreading of the legs (3) is 
fastened to the legs (3). 
Extensometer according to Claim 11, wherein a 
capacitor plate (1, 2) belonging to the capacitor 

arrangement (1, 2) is fastened to each leg (3). 
Extensometer according to Claim 12, wherein the 
capacitor plates (1, 2) are oriented approximately 

parallel to one another.
