<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce a component having a magnetic core (1), at least this magnetic core is provided with a sheathing (11) which can be produced by coating. Before the application of the coating, the magnetic core is covered and/or impregnated with a viscofluid compound (12) which reduces the adhesion forces between the sheathing (11) and the magnetic core (1) thus permitting a relative movement which converts sound energy into heat and thus produces noise damping. Furthermore, this sheathing acts as an elastic buffer, thus reducing the forces acting on the magnetic core through the sheathing and hence leading to an improvement in the magnetic properties of the inductive component. Instead of, or in addition to, the sheathing (11), a further noise reduction is obtained if a damping layer (8) is bonded into the air gap between mutually adjacent end surfaces of the core halves (2) and (3).
