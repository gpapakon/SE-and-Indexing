<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain hydroxy derivatives 
of 3,4-dihydro-2,5,7,8-tetraalkyl-2H-1-benzopyran-2-carboxylic 
acids and the lactones thereof, to the processes 
and intermediates useful for their preparation and to their 
use as free radical scavengers useful in the treatment of 
tissue damage implicated with free oxygen radicals. More particularly, this invention relates to compounds 
of the formulae 
  
 
their individual isomers and mixtures thereof, and the 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein 
Ris H or C1-4 alkyl, R1is C1-4 alkyl, R2is H or C(O)R3, R3is H or C1-9 alkyl, R4is OR or N(R)2, R5is H, -C(O)R or C1-4 alkyl, and nis zero or one. As used herein the term alkyl includes the straight and 
branched-chain radicals having the designated number of 
carbon atoms with methyl and ethyl being preferred. The 
-C(O)R3 moiety embraces formyl and the straight and 
branched-chain alkylcarbonyl moieties with formyl, methylcarbonyl 
and ethylcarbonyl being preferred. In the instance 
wherein R4 forms an amide it is preferred that both alkyl 
groups be the same and that the alkyl radicals are methyl 
or ethyl in both mono- or di-alkylated amido situations. 
When variables such as R are used more than once to define 
a structure, it is to mean that in each instance the 
variable may represent a different moiety. The compounds of the present invention include stereoisomers; 
the term "stereoisomer" is a general term for all 
isomers of individual molecules that differ only in the 
orientation of their atoms in space. It includes mirror 
image isomers (enantiomers), geometric isomers (cis/trans), 
and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral center 
that are not mirror images of one another (diastereoisomers). In general the compounds of Formulae IA and IB 
(collectively referred to as compounds of Formula I) may be 
prepared, isolated and converted to the desired salts by  
 
chemical processes, work-up and crystallization techniques 
analogously known in the art. Conveniently, the starting 
materials are either known or may be prepared by standard 
procedures. The preparation of the compounds of Formula I may be 
schematically depicted in the following reaction schemes A 
and B.  
 
 
wherein R and R1 are as previously defined and Ac is the 
preferred acyl moiety.  
 
In this reaction sequence the acids (2) are sequentially 
esterified and acetylated to produce compounds (3) which are 
dehydrogenated, using a reagent such as DDQ (2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone) 
to the
