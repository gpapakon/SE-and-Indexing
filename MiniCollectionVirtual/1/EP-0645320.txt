<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a container for tubular bags, having a body 1 which is open at the upper end and can receive a tubular bag 4 vertically in a lengthwise alignment, and having a lid 2 which is movably connected to the body 1 and can be retained in the closed state of use. In the front region, the lid 2 has an opening 3 through which the front corner 5 of the tubular bag 4 can protrude. In the rear region, the lid 2 interacts with a downwardly projecting web 6 which, in the state of use of the lid, presses the rear corner 8 of the tubular bag against a counterface 9 arranged in the region of the rear wall of the body 1.

A container for flexible tubular bag packages, having a body (1; 1') which is open 
at its upper end and which can receive a flexible tubular bag (4) vertically in alignment with 

its sidewalls, and having a lid (2; 2'; 2'') which is movably attached to the body (1; 1'), 
which can be locked in its closed condition of use, and which has an opening (3; 3'; 3'') in 

its front region through which the front corner (5) of the flexible tubular bag (4) can 
protrude, 
characterised in that
 the lid (2; 2'; 2'') cooperates in its rear region with a 
downwardly projecting rib (6; 6'), which in the condition of use of the lid presses the rear 

corner (8) of the flexible tubular bag on to a counter-face disposed in the region of the rear 
wall (11) of the body (1; 1'). 
A container according to claim 1, characterised in that the rib (6; 6') is fixed to the 
lid (2; 2'; 2''). 
A container according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the lid (2) is placed on 
the body (1) and that the body (1) comprises a projection (7) forming the counter-face. 
A container according to claim 3, characterised in that the cooperating clamping faces 
of the rib (6) of the lid (2) and of the projection (7) of the body (1) are inclined in relation 

to the longitudinal axis of the body. 
A container according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that in its rear region the lid 
(2') is pivotally attached to the rear wall (11) of the body (1'). 
A container according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
upper side of the lid (2; 2') is inclined towards its front region. 
A container according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
lid (2; 2'; 2'') is provided with a movable closure element (9; 9'; 12; 14) which in one end  

 
position seals the opening
 (3; 3'; 3'') and nips the front corner (5) of the flexible tubular bag 
(4) which protrudes through the opening. 
A container according to claim 7, characterised in that a spring clip (9; 9') is attached 
to the lid (2), and in one end position presses the front corner (5) of the flexible tubular bag 

(4) on to an edge (10; 10') of the opening (3; 3'') in the lid (2; 2''). 
A container according to claim 8, characterised in that the spring clip (9') is fixed at 
one end to the lid (2'') and at the other end is attached to a spring element (17) which is 

supported on the lid (2''). 
A container according to claim 9, characterised in that the spring clip (9') comprises 
a hinge (16). 
A container according to claim 6, characterised in that two swivelling flanks (12) and 
a slider (13) are attached to the lid (2'), wherein the slider (13), on a displacement of the 

same, presses the two flanks (12) together, and the latter nip the front corner (5) of the 
flexible tubular bag (4) between them. 
A container according to claim 7, characterised in that a rotary knob (15) is attached 
to the lid (2') and comprises a sight-hole (14) which in one end position of the rotary knob 

presses the front corner (5) of the flexible tubular bag (4) on to an edge (10') of the opening 
(3') in the lid (2'). 
A container according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
body (1; 1') and/or the lid (2; 2'; 2'') consists of synthetic material.
