<ABSTRACT>
A surgical suturing needle has a tapered needle head 
with a multi-faceted cross-section. The cross-section 

is formed by three circumferentially-spaced cutting 
edges (20) formed at a primary angle (α) and a plurality of 

extended legs (24), each extending from one of the primary 
angles and formed at a secondary angle (Θ). In addition, a 

plurality of connecting surfaces (26) adjoin adjacent 
extended legs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgical suturing
needle for penetrating cutaneous and sub-cutaneous
tissue. More particularly, the surgical needle is
provided with a tapered needle head having a 15-sided
cross-section and three cutting edges,
and is used generally for adjoining or closing adjacent
portions of skin or tissue.Suturing needles for applying sutures, or stitches, by
hand in cutaneous and sub-cutaneous tissue are well
known in the art. Typically, the sutures are used to
close wounds or adjoin adjacent tissue, often at the
conclusion of a surgical procedure. Suturing needles
are usually made from a cut blank of material such as
stainless steel. The cut blank is metal-worked using
well known machining techniques to form the surgical
suturing needle. The needle generally includes a
shaft, a rear end portion with means to grip or secure
a suturing thread and a needle head at a front end
portion for puncturing skin and tissue through which
the needle travels. The needle head typically includes
a sharpened needle tip at its distal end and cutting
edges.An important consideration in designing surgical
suturing needles is needle sharpness. Sharper needles 
require less force to penetrate the tissue and thus
cause less tissue trauma. In addition, sharper needles
reduce fatigue on the needle itself, making it less
likely to bend or break during suturing. Needle
sharpness is typically defined in terms of a so-called
penetration force -- the force necessary for a needle
to puncture, or penetrate, the tissue. The penetration
force is primarily determined by the design and
sharpness of the needle point and the cutting edges
formed on the needle head.US-A-4 932 961
discloses a needle having a tapered
cutting edge with a five-sided cross-section. The
needle has three fluted edges for cutting the tissue.
The cross-section is basically triangular in shape, but
indentations are provided in two fluted edges of the
triangle to form the five sides and accentuate the
third fluted edge.EP-A-424 152 discloses a surgical needle with a ten-sided cross-section. This surgical
needle does not solve the problem of reducing the surface area thereof to be ground
during sharpening.However, further improvements in surgical needle design
are desirable. The subject invention provides
significant advances over conventional suturing needles
by improving needle attributes such as needle
sharpness, while also reducing the machining costs of
manufacturing the needle.Accordingly, it is a general object of the present
invention to

<CLAIMS>
A surgical needle having a tapered needle head with a 15-sided cross-section, said
cross-section comprising:


three circumferentially-spaced cutting edges (20), each cutting edge (20) having a base
portion and two cutting surfaces formed at a primary angle ();
three extended legs (24), with each leg extending from the base portion of one
of said cutting edges (20) and formed at a secondary angle (α); and
three connecting surfaces (26), each connecting surface adjoining adjacent extended
legs (24), whereby the primary angle is larger than the secondary angle.
A needle of Claim 1 comprising:

a needle shaft;
suturing thread securing means at a rear end of said needle shaft;
said tapered needle head at a front end of said needle shaft, said needle head tapering
to a needle point.
The surgical needle of Claim 1 or 2, wherein said connecting surfaces are planar.
The surgical needle of Claim 1 or 2, wherein said connecting surfaces are concave.
The surgical needle of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the primary angles of each said cutting
edge are formed at the same angle. 
The surgical needle of Claim 2, wherein a middle portion of said needle shaft is
rectangular in cross-section.
The surgical needle of Claim 2, wherein said suturing thread securing means includes
a barrel-shaped end with an axial hole for securing the suturing thread.
