Device for detecting a fault in the functioning 
of an electronic ignition system of an engine, especially 

of a motor vehicle, of the type including a computer 
controlling the supply to the primary circuits of ignition 

coils (1, 2, 3), secondary circuits of which coils are 
connected to spark plugs associated with cylinders of the 

engine, the device including means (7, 8, 9) for the 
statistical analysis of the spark durations between the 

electrodes of the spark plugs in order to determine a 
function fault, characterized in that the means for 

statistical analysis comprise means (7) for acquiring the 
spa
rk durations from the voltages in the primary circuits 
of the coils (1, 2, 3), in that the statistical analysis 

means additionally comprise means (8) for calculating, for 
each cylinder, statistical indicators of mean value, of 

momentary square deviation and of mean square deviation, on 
N values of durations, and means (9) for analysing these 

indicators in order to determine a fault, in that the means 
(9) for analysing the indicators are arranged to compare 

the statistical indicators, relating to the different 
cylinders of the engine, with one another and/or with 

calibrated thresholds depending on the operating conditions 
of the engine, in order to detect a function fault, in that 

the analysing means (9) are arranged to compare the momentary 
square deviation, associated with a cylinder, with a 

calibrated threshold in order to increment or decrement a 
counter the value of which is compared to a filtering value 

(F) in order to indicate a serious function fault in the 
ignition system, in the event that it is exceeded, and in 

that the analysing means (9) are arranged to compare the 
mean square deviation and the mean value with calibrated 

thresholds in order to determine a critical function fault  
 

in the ignition system, in the event that they are 
exceeded. 
Detection device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the acquisition means (7) comprise means (10, 

13) for multiplexing the overvoltages produced in the 
primary circuits of the coils by the sparks, and means (11, 

12) for filtering and re-forming the output signal of the 
multiplexing means, in order to deliver to the remainder of 

the device a binary signal having indentations the duration 
of which represents the durations of the sparks. 
Detection device according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the multiplexing means (10,13) comprise an 

operational amplifier (13) receiving at one input the 
operating voltages of the primary circuits of the coils (1, 

2, 3) and at another input the voltages actually present in 
the primary circuits in order to determine the overvoltages 

produced by the sparks. 
Detection device according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the means (8, 9) 

for calculating and analysing the statistical indicators 
comprise storage means assigned to each cylinder of the 

engine and in which are stored the values of the corresponding 
spark durations, from which these indicators are 

calculated and analysed. 
Device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a serious fault in the 

functioning of the ignition system corresponds to the 
absence of ignition. 
Device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a critical fault in the 

functioning of the ignition system corresponds to poor 
quality ignition. 
Device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the analysing means (9) are 

arranged to compare the mean value, associated with a 
cylinder, with the mean value associated with the twin  

 
cylinder in the exhaust phase in order to determine a 

deviation, the deviation being compared with a calibrated 
threshold in order to determine a critical fault in the 

functioning of the ignition system, in the event that it is 
exceeded. 
Device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the calculating and analysing 

means comprise a microcontroller (14).
