<ABSTRACT>
A continuous belt for power transmission has a thin elongated strip (10) having a pair of ends. A serpentine biasing portion (22, 30, 32, 34) is integrally formed in the strip between the ends. Also, the ends are permanently joined with one another to provide an endless belt to transit power or torque.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ENDLESS FLEXIBLE DRIVE BELTBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to drive belts and, mor particularly, to an endless or continuous drive belt with serpentine spring biasing portion.Ordinarily, drive belts which drive rotary equipment ar either of a belt or chain type. The belt type is generall manufactured from a polymeric material with or without reinforcin filament strands. The chain type generally includes a plurality o interconnected links.In the automotive industry, fan belts are commonly used t transmit power from an engine to various accessories such a compressors, alternators or the like. During start-up of th engine, a peak torque is required to begin to turn or rotate th belt to drive the accessories. Once the engine starts and runs the torque is reduced and less force is exerted onto the belt During the peak torque at start-up, the belt is stretched to degree that may permanently deform the belt. Ordinarily, a adjustable tensioner is utilized to take up the excessive play i the fan belt. Thus, it would be desirable to provide a continuou belt which would reduce the peak torque required by the engin without permanent deformation of the belt.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention t overcome the above disadvantages. The present invention provide 

a continuous belt with a serpentine spring biasing portion to transmit torque which is easily adapted to replace belts or chains. The present invention provides a continuous belt which has more than one mode of recoverable deformation to enable the belt to first elongate in response to a large force and to provide additional elongation in response to a much smaller force. This endless belt enables the engine to have a lower peak torque at start-up.From the following description and claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFigure 1 illustrates a schematic view of driving and driven equipment including a continuous belt in accordance with the present invention.Figure 2 is a partial perspective view of the continuous belt in accordance with the present invention.Figure 3 is a graph of the force versus displacement of the belt in accordance with the present invention.Figure 4 is a partial perspective view of another embodiment of a belt in accordance with the present invention.Figure 5 is a cross section view of another belt in accordance with the present
