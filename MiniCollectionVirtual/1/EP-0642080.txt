<ABSTRACT>
A clock stoppage detector and a selector selection 
determining circuit are provided on each of a plurality 

of circuit boards. If any abnormality is detected in the 
clock selected in accordance with selector control 

information supplied from a clock selection controller 
provided common to the plurality of circuit boards, the 

selector selection determining circuit changes the 
selection independently of the selection control 

information. The selector selection determining circuit 
also performs clock selection independently when failure 

occurs to the clock selection controller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
controlling clock selection in a redundant clock system 
and, more particularly, to a clock selection control 
device designed to prevent the selection of a failed 
clock and the stoppage of device functions in the event 
of failure of a clock selection controller. In recent years, transmission/communication 
apparatus, information processing apparatus and other 
equipment for processing digital signals have been 
increasing in functional complexity, in accordance with 
which enhancing system reliability has become a major 
consideration in designing these apparatus. To achieve 
this, techniques have been employed wherein the master 
clock of the device is designed with a redundant circuit 
and, within each device section operated by the clock, 
control is performed for the selection between the 
current and spare clock in the event of clock failure. In one such redundant master clock selection 
system, a selector for selecting a clock is provided 
within each device section, and a clock selection 
controller is provided common to the entire device. In 
such a system, information concerning the detection of a 
clock stoppage at the selector input in each device 
section is supplied to the clock selection controller, 
which then makes a decision as to which of the clocks is 
to be selected. Based on this decision, the clock 
selection controller supplies selector control 
information to the device section. In accordance with 
the selector control information, the selector within the 
device section switches the clock path from the current 
clock to the spare clock.  The above prior art clock selection-system, 
however, has had the problem that if the clock selection 
controller becomes faulty, or if the clock selection 
controller is disconnected during maintenance or is not 
connected correctly for operation, for example, the 
switching by the selector in each device section may not 
be accomplished properly, resulting in the stoppage of 
device functions. In view of the above problem with the prior art, it 
is an object of the present invention to prevent the 
stoppage of functions of each device section due to clock 
selection failure, by employing a configuration in which 
a selector for selecting a clock in each device section 
is normally controlled on the basis of selector control 
information supplied from a clock selection controller, 
and in the event of failure, disconnection, or other 
trouble of the clock selection controller, the switching 
oper

<CLAIMS>
A clock selection control device for selecting 
one of two clock signals supplied to each of a plurality 

of circuit units in parallel to each other, comprising: 
   clock selection control means, connected 

to the sources of said two clock signals and to said 
plurality of circuit units, for determining a clock 

signal to be selected and for supplying to each of said 
plurality of circuit units control information directing 

the selection of said determined clock signal; 
   a plurality of clock failure detecting 

means, respectively connected to said plurality of 
circuit units, for detecting an abnormality in the clock 

signal being supplied to each of said plurality of 
circuit units and for outputting a clock failure signal 

when an abnormality is detected; and 
   a plurality of selection determining means 

respectively connected to said plurality of circuit 
units, each selection determining means changing the 

clock signal selection independently of said control 
information, when said clock failure signal is output for 

the clock signal selected in the circuit unit connected 
thereto. 
A clock selection control device according to 
claim 1, wherein in the event of failure of said clock 

selection control means, failure information is input to 
each of said plurality of selection determining means, 

and wherein the selection determining means determines 
the clock signal selection independently of said control 

information, in response to said failure information. 
A clock selection control device according to 
claim 1 or 2, wherein said selection determining means 

are each allowed to independently change the clock signal 
selection only when the unselected clock signal is 

operating normally. 
A clock selection control device according to 
claim 3, further comprising: a first switch for selecting 

 
one of said two clock signals under control of said 

selection determining means to thereby supply the 
selected clock signal to said circuit unit; and a second 

switch, operating in an interlinked fashion with said 
first switch, for selecting a clock failure signal 

pertaining to the selected clock signal to thereby supply 
the selected clock failure signal to said selection 

determining means. 
A clock selection control device according to 
claim 4, further comprising a third switch, operating in 

an interlinked fashion with said first and said second 
switch, for supplying a clock signal which is not 

selected by the first switch to said selection 
determining means, wherein said selection determining 

means changes the clock selection using the clock signal 
supplied via said third signal as an operation clock. 
A clock selection control device according to 
claim 5, wherein said selection determining means 

includes a fourth switch which is controlled by said 
failure information and which selects said control 

information when said failure information is not input 
and selects information pertaining to the result of the 

selection by said selection determining means when said 
failure information is input. 
A clock selection control device according to 
claim 6, wherein said selection determining means further 

includes: an exclusive-OR circuit which accepts the clock 
failure signal selected by said second switch at one 

input and the information selected by said fourth switch 
at the other input thereof; and a flip-flop circuit to 

which an output from said exclusive-OR circuit is 
supplied as a data input and the clock signal selected by 

said third switch is supplied as a clock input, and which
