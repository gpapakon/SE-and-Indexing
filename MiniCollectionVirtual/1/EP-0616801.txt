<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an advantageous process for preparing liposomes for inclusion of water-soluble or hydrophilic substances or mixtures of substances, which by comparison with known processes provides the surprising advantage of increasing the content of actually included substances or mixtures of substances and, on pharmaceutical use, the advantage of sterile operating conditions. This entails a mixture consisting of at least one phospholipid and conventional lipophilic auxiliaries being exposed to a mobile support phase consisting of carbon dioxide and a polar organic solvent (modifier) under supercritical pressure and temperature conditions, decompressing the compressed mixed phase to atmospheric pressure, and transferring it into an aqueous phase containing a substance which has water-soluble or hydrophilic properties and is to be encapsulated in liposomes.

or salts of these compounds;
c) water in the purity required for the intended application, and where appropriate
d) additional excipients customary for the intended application,

characterised in that a mixture consisting of at least one phospholipid b) and, where
appropriate, lipophilic excipients d) customary for the intended application, is subjected to a

mobile carrier phase consisting of carbon dioxide and a polar organic solvent (modifier) under
pressure and temperature conditions which are higher than the critical pressure and the critical

temperature of a pure carbon dioxide phase, the compressed mixed phase that is obtainable is
reduced to normal pressure and is transferred to an aqueous phase containing a substance for

encapsulation in liposomes or a mixture of substances for encapsulation a) having water-soluble
or hydrophilic properties and, where appropriate, water-soluble excipients d) customary

for the intended application, and, where appropriate, the organic solvent is removed and/or a
fraction of liposomes having a desired diameter range is separated off and/or the liposome

dispersion is converted into a form suitable for the intended application.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that radioactive labeling compounds,
fluorescent compounds, pharmaceutical active ingredients or active ingredient combinations are

used as the substance or mixture of substances for encapsulation a).
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that hydrophilic or water-soluble
pharmaceutical active ingredients are used as the substance for encapsulation a).
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that zinc-phthalocyanine tetrasulphonate
[ZnPc(SO
3
H)

] is used as the substance for encapsulation a).
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that synthetic, substantially pure 1-n-hexa-decanoyl-2-(9-cis-octadecenoyl)-3-sn-phosphatidyl
choline is used as the phospholipid b).
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that sterilised water for injection purposes
is used as component c).
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that cholesterol is used as the lipophilic
excipient d).
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that water-soluble excipients for the
establishment of isotonic conditions are used as the excipient d).

approximately 72 to 400 bar is used.
Process according to claim 10, characterised in that a pressure range of approximately
200 to 300 bar is used.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that an elevated
temperature of approximately 32 to 100°C is used. 
Process according to claim 12, characterised in that an elevated temperature of
approximately 50 to 60°C is used.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 13, characterised in that the liposome
dispersion that is obtainable is converted into a form suitable for intravenous application.
