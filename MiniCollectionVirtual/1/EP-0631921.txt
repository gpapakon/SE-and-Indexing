<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for controlling and regulating electric, electronic or electromechanical components in rail vehicles, a substation (3a, 3b, 3c) which contains a microcomputer (4a, 4b, 4c) and is connected to a central control unit (7) via at least one transmission path (6) being assigned to each interchangeable component (2a, 2b, 2c) the said central control unit (7) containing at least one microcomputer (10) and a non-volatile fault memory (11) and being designed, in the case of anomalous operating behaviour of the components (2a, 2b, 2c) to form fault reports with a fault code by processing data arriving from the substations (3a, 3b, 3c) and to store the said fault reports which are formed in it and relate to the invidual components not only in its fault memory (11) but also to transmit such fault reports to the respective component (2a, 2b, 2c) whose substation (3a, 3b, 3c) itself is designed to receive the fault report and to store it in a non-volatile fault memory (13a, 13b, 13c) which is a physical part of the substation and thus of the component.

Device for the purpose of controlling and regulating electrical, electronic or
electromechanical components (2a, 2b, 2c) in rail-borne vehicles, wherein provided in each

vehicle are at least one microcomputer (4a, 4b, 4c), a fault memory (13a, 13b, 13c) and a
communications interface (5a, 5b, 5c) which is connected to a control station (7) by way of at

least one transmission path (6), and the control station (7) contains at least one
microcomputer (10) and an interface (9) and a non-volatile fault memory (11) and, in the

event of abnormal operating behaviour of the components (2a, 2b, 2c), said control station is
arranged to produce fault reports comprising a fault code by processing incoming data and to

store said fault reports in the fault memory (11), 
characterised in that
 each interchangeable
component (2a, 2b, 2c) of a vehicle is allocated in each case a substation (3a, 3b, 3c), wherein

each substation contains a microcomputer (4a, 4b, 4c), a communications interface (5a, 5b,
5c) and a battery-buffered RAM or a non-volatile fault memory (13a, 13b, 13c) for

component malfunctions, wherein the control station (7) is arranged not only to store fault
reports, which are produced therein and relate to individual components, in its fault memory

(11) but also to transmit fault reports of this kind to the relevant component (2a, 2b, 2c), of
which the substation (3a, 3b, 3c) is in turn arranged to receive the fault report and to store it

in its fault memory (13a, 13b, 13c), and that the fault memory (13a, 13b, 13c) is a physical
part of the substation (3a, 3b, 3c) and therefore of the component (2a, 2b, 2c).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the transmission path (6) is a serial data
bus.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the control station (7) is arranged
during the production of a fault report to provide said fault report with a substation address

with the aid of an I/O-map. 
Device according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the control station (7) is arranged to
determine, with respect to each substation address, the exact identification data, such as e.g.

series number and type designation of the component and to store this data in a configuration
table and to use the fault code, substation identification data and identification data of the

control station to produce the message header of the fault report.
Device according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the substation (3a, 3b, 3c) of a
component (2a, 2b, 2c) comprises a memory region (14a, 14b, 14c) for the purpose of storing

identification data and the control station (7) is arranged to use the data, which is stored in the
memory regions (14a, 14b, 14c) of each substation, independently to produce its

configuration table and to keep it up to date.
Device according to any one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the control station
(7) is arranged to output a fault report list in response to a request made via an input/output

unit (12), which fault report list comprises the copies of the fault reports which are stored in
the fault memories (13a, 13b, 13c) of the substations (3a, 3b, 3c).
Device according to any one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 there is provided a
head control station (8) which in is disposed, in particular, in a traction vehicle and which

takes precedence over individual control stations (7, 7') disposed in freight cars (1, 1') and is
connected to said control stations for the purpose exchanging data telegrams via a

transmission path (15).
