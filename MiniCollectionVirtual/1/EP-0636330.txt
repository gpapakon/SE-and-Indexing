<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a tablet device which comprises frame bodies each having a length, corner joints 
adapted to be pivotally fitted on edges of the frame bodies for enabling a demounting action from the front of the 

tablet device, and a bearing member adapted for mounting to a back surface of a sheet-shaped article and formed with 
a storage space which can store a number of non-framed articles such as other testimonials, pictures and the like. The 

present tablet device comprises frame bodies, corner joints adapted for pivotally connecting to the frame bodies, a 
monolayered or multi-layered sheet-shaped article adapted for mounting on the front sides of the frame bodies, and 

a bearing member adapted for mounting reawardly of the sheet-shaped article and formed with a storage space, said 
bearing member being mounted between engaging portions of the frame bodies and base plates of the corner joints, 

and flange portions of the frame bodies being mounted between the engaging portions and partitions of the frame 
bodies together with the sheet-shaped articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a picture frame device for 
displaying a sheet-like exhibit such as a picture or 
testimonial, etc. In more detail, the present invention 
relates to a frame device which has a space for containing 
other exhibitable sheets than the exhibit. General practically used picture frame devices do not have 
any space for containing any other exhibitable sheets than 
the exhibit. So, it is practiced to keep those other 
exhibitable sheets behind the exhibit in layers, but many 
exhibitable sheets cannot be contained in this way. There are also picture frame devices with a space for 
containing other exhibitable sheets than the exhibit, but 
most of them simply has a separate detachable container 
behind them. So, it is troublesome to take out the other 
exhibitable sheets than the exhibit for exchanging the 
exhibit or confirming those exhibitable sheets. Furthermore, there is a picture frame device with an 
exhibit and a transparent resin sheet overlapped on a back  
 
sheet made of foam styrene surrounded on the four sides by U-shaped 
framing straight members connected by joints at the 
butt corners. The frame device allows the exhibit to be 
taken in and out by removing only one of the framing straight 
members, but if other exhibitable sheets than the exhibit are 
contained in layers as described above, it is troublesome to 
confirm the other exhibitable sheets. If these other exhibitable sheets than the exhibit such as 
pictures and testimonials are kept in a cylindrical container, 
they are kept curled and must be straightened when exhibited. The object of the present invention is to present a picture 
frame device which allows the framing straight members to be 
removed from the front of the frame device by pivotally 
rotating the corner joints and has a space formed in a 
container installed behind the exhibit or the exhibit held 
between holding sheets, for containing many other exhibitable 
sheets than the exhibit such as pictures and testimonials. The present invention is comprised of framing straight 
members, corner joints pivotally rotatably fitted at the 
respective both ends of the framing straight members, an  
 
exhibit or an exhibit held between holding sheets held on the 
front side of the framing straight members, and a container 
installed behind the exhibit or the exhibit held between 
holding sheets, wherein each of the framing straight members 
has a holding portion formed inward at its front end to hold 
the surface of the exhibit or the exhibit held

has a holding portion formed inward at its front end to hold 

the surface of the exhibit or the exhibit held between 
holding sheets and a pivotal rotation supporting portion 

formed inward at its back end; from an intermediate position 
between the holding portion and the pivotal rotation 

supporting portion, extended is a partition at least 
partially located on the pivotal rotation arc formed with the 

pivotal rotation supporting portion as the approximate center; 

each of the corner joints has a pivotal rotation base strip 
engaged, at its back end, with the pivotal rotation 

supporting portion of the framing straight member, and 
capable of being kept, at its front end, in slidable contact 

with the partition and engaged partially with the partition; 
from the pivotal rotation base strip, an arcuate portion is 

extended to be able to be kept in slidable contact and 
engaged with the tip of the partition; from the arcuate 

 
portion, a corner joint board is further extended; and the 

container has a space formed, and together with the exhibit 
or the exhibit held between holding sheets, it is installed 

between the holding portions of the framing straight members 
and the corner joint boards.
