<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of certain NK1 receptor antagonists, in
the treatment of emesis.Tachykinin antagonists, including substance P antagonists, are known to be
useful in the treatment of a variety of disorders including pain, inflammatory
diseases, allergic disorders, CNS disorders, skin disorders, cough and
gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.It has now been found that NK1 receptor antagonists are useful in the treatment
of emesis. Our co-pending European Patent Application No. 92202831
(Publication No. 0533280) relates to the use of tachykinin antagonists, including
NK1 receptor antagonists, in the treatment of emesis.The use of the NK1 receptor antagonists specifically disclosed in co-pending
European Patent Application No. 92202831 in the treatment of emesis is not
included within the scope of the present invention.The invention accordingly provides, in a first aspect, the novel use of the NK1
receptor antagonists, generically and specifically disclosed in published
PCT Patent Application No. 92/21677,
in the treatment of emesis.There is also provided as a further aspect of the invention the use of the NK1
receptor antagonists, generically and specifically disclosed in the above
referenced patent specification, for the preparation of a medicament for
the treatment of emesis.It will be appreciated that reference to treatment is intended to include
prophylaxis as well as the alleviation of established symptoms.NK1 receptor antagonists, disclosed in the above referenced patent
specification, have been shown to have anti-emetic activity as indicated by for
example their ability to inhibit cisplatin- or radiation-induced emesis in the ferret. The treatment of emesis mentioned hereinbefore includes the treatment of
nausea, retching and vomiting. Emesis includes acute emesis, delayed emesis
and anticipatory emesis. NK1 receptor antagonists are useful in the treatment of
emesis however induced. For example, emesis may be induced by drugs such
as cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as alkylating agents, e.g.
cyclophosphamide, carmustine, lomustine and chlorambucil; cytotoxic
antibiotics, e.g. dactinomycin, doxorubicin, mitomycin-C and bleomycin; antimetabolites,
e.g. cytarabine, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil; vinca alkaloids,
e.g. etoposide, vinblastine and vincristine; and others such as cisplatin,
dacarbazine, procarbazine and hydroxyurea; and combinations thereof;
radiation sickness; radiation therapy, e.g. irradiation of the thorax or abdomen,
