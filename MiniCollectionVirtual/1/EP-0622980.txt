<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for mounting 
an electronic component on a flexible printed circuit 
board which is to be used in an electronic apparatus or 
the like. In recent years, various electronic apparatuses 
are increasingly demanded to be small size and light 
weight for realization of a portable type or a 
multifunctional type. A flexible printed circuit board 
(hereinafter referred to as an FPC) is able to be 
installed in the electronic apparatuses at a bent portion 
and an opening space with thin size and light weight. 
Therefore, the FPC is widely used in the electronic 
apparatuses. Conventionally, method for mounting electronic 
component on the FPC is different in terms of composition 
of the FPC as follows: 
(I) The FPC has a polyimide film used as an 
insulation film and a copper foil pasted on the polyimide 
film by means of an insulating resin adhesive or the like 
and used as a printed circuit.  
 
The electronic component is generally mounted on 
the copper foil of the FPC by soldering. (II) The FPC has a polyester film used as the 
insulation film and a conductive silver resin paste formed 
on the polyester film by way of printing such as screen 
printing and used as the printed circuit. In this FPC, since the printed circuit is formed 
on the insulation film by way of printing, there is an 
advantage to manufacture the FPC with low cost. However, 
on the other hand, the electronic component can not be 
mounted by soldering directly on the conductive silver 
resin paste of the FPC. Therefore, in this FPC, the 
electronic component is mounted usually with the following 
steps: 
(1) an electrode part is provided with the 
printed circuit on the insulation film, (2) a terminal of the electronic component is 
connected with the electrode part via the conductive 
adhesive, and (3) in order to reinforce a connecting portion 
having the terminal and the electrode part, an insulating 
resin adhesive is applied around the connecting portion 
with a dispenser or the like. Furthermore, in a method for connecting the 
terminal of the electronic component with the printed 
circuit, apart from the above-mentioned method, the  
 
following two methods have been known. 
(I) A method described in the unexamined 
published Japanese application (TOKKAI) SHO 63-158711 
wherein 
(1) the terminal is disposed between two 
thermoplastic insulation films so as to face the printed 
circuit, (2) the terminal is connected with the printed 
circuit via the conductive adhesive, and (3) two thermoplastic
