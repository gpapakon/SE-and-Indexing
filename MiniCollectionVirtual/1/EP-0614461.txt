<ABSTRACT>
The present invention pertains to a process for the production of polyol fatty acid polyesters by reacting a reactant mixture of polyol, a fatty acid lower alkyl ester, a transesterification catalyst and an alkali metal soap emulsifier. The process comprises removing non-dissolved alkali metal soap from the reaction mixture at a degree of transesterification of more than 60 %, preferably 65-90 %, and recycling the alkali metal soap that is removed during the transesterification to the starting reactant mixture. The invention is applicable both to a batch-wise polyol polyester synthesis and to a continuous synthesis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of
polyol fatty acid polyesters wherein a reaction mixture of a polyol
and/or fatty acid oligoesters thereof, a fatty acid lower alkyl ester,
a transesterification catalyst and an alkali metal soap emulsifier is
caused to react under transesterification conditions and the alkali metal
soap level is reduced during the transesterification reaction.By "polyol" is meant any aliphatic or aromatic compound which
comprises at least four free hydroxyl groups. In particular such polyols
include the group of sugar polyols, which comprise the sugars, i.e. the
mono-, di- and polysaccharides, the corresponding sugar alcohols and the
derivatives thereof having at least four free hydroxyl groups. Examples
of sugar polyols include glucose, mannose, galactose, xylose, fructose,
sorbose, tagatose, ribulose, xylulose, lactose, maltose, raffinose,
cellobiose, sucrose, erythritol, mannitol, lactitol, sorbitol, xylitol
and Î±-methylglucoside. A preferred sugar polyol is sucrose.In this specification by "polyol fatty acid polyester" is meant
any such polyesters or mixtures thereof having a degree of conversion of
at least 80%, in particular at least 90 %. The degree of conversion is
defined as the percentage of polyol hydroxyl groups of the polyol fatty
acid polyester that on an average have been esterified with fatty acids.
Thus a degree of conversion of 100 % corresponds to the fully esterified
polyol.In this specification by "fatty acid" are meant C8-C24 fatty acids
which may be saturated or unsaturated, and may have straight or branched
alkyl chains.The polyol fatty acid polyesters are known to be suitable low-calorie
fat-replacers in edible products. They are substantially
indigestible for human beings while they have physical and organoleptic
properties very similar to triglyceride oils and fats conventionally used
in edible products. Polyol fatty acid polyesters are further reported to
have use as pharmaceutical agents in view of their ability to absorb fat-soluble
substances, such as in particular cholesterol, in the gastrointestinal
tract, and remove these substances from the human body.In general polyol fatty acid polyesters are synthesized by a
process in which a polyol, such as a mono- or disaccharide, is reacted
with a fatty acid lower alkyl ester, often the fatty acid methyl ester, 
in the presence of a transesterification catalyst, such as e.g. an alkali
metal hydroxide or carbonate. In a first stage a polyol fatty acid mono-
or oligoester is formed,

Process according to any one of claims 1-6, wherein at least
50% of the total amount of alkali metal soap present in the transesterification

reaction is removed.
Process according to any one of claims 1-7, wherein the alkali
