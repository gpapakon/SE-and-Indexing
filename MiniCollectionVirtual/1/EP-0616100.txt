<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a locking device consisting of a reversible flat key (2) and lock cylinder (1), with depressions (31), arranged on opposite broad faces of the key (2), for allocating the tumbler pins (13), and with run-on slopes which are located in the region of the key tip in alignment with the respective row of depressions and each of which runs in an obliquely descending manner into the respective opposite broad face of the key, the depressions of each row being provided in a respective rib (23, 24) projecting freely on opposite broad faces of the key, and proposes, for the purpose of improved guidance of the tumbler pins along with a high combination possibility and a key shank stable against breakage, that the freely projecting portion of the two ribs (23, 24) be larger than half the key thickness, in such a way that entry free spaces (25, 26) extending beyond the longitudinal mid-plane (A-A) of the key and intended for the core-side ends (19) of the tumbler pins (13) are provided on both sides of each rib (23, 24).
