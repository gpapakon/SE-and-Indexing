<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a novel improved alpha interferon composition characterized by high specific activity, a purity of greater than 95 % and which upon use in humans is further characterized by a substantial reduction in side effects normally associated with alpha interferon compositions. Also provided is a method for large scale production of the composition from human peripheral blood leukocytes. This alpha interferon composition may be used therapeutically in the treatment of cancers and diseases of the immune system and/or viral etiology.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to alpha
interferon compositions. More specifically, the invention
relates to an improved alpha interferon composition
having high specific activity, a purity of greater
than 95% and which upon use in humans has
a substantial reduction in side effects
normally associated with alpha interferon compositions, and
to a method for large scale production of the composition from
human peripheral blood leukocytes.Human alpha interferon comprises a family of more
than fifteen proteins with antiviral, antigrowth and
immunoregulatory activities [Pestka et al., Ann. Rev.
Biochem., 56:727 (1987)]. The therapeutic efficacy of human
alpha interferons has been established for human cancers and
viral diseases. For example, recombinant interferons (IFN
alfa-2a, IFN alfa-2b, IFN alfa-2c), cell-line derived
interferon (IFN alfa-n1) and interferon derived from
leukocytes (IFN alfa-n3) are currently used for the
treatment of Condyloma acuminata, hepatitis [Weck et al.,
Am. J. Med., 85(Suppl 2A):159 (1988); Korenman et al.,
Annal. Intern. Med., 114:629 (1991); Friedman-Kien et al.,
JAMA, 259:533 (1988)], for the regression of some 
malignancies [Baron et al., JAMA, 266:1375 (1991)], for the
treatment of AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma [Physicians Desk
Reference, 47th edit., eds. Medical Economics Data,
Montvale, NJ, p. 2194 and 2006 (1993)] and are currently
being considered for the treatment of human acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) either alone or in
combination with other antiviral agents [Hirsch, Am. J.
Med., 85(Suppl 2A):182 (1988)].Recombinant interferons can be made by using
genetic engineering techniques, for example, in Escherichia
coli in large scale [Goeddel et al., Nature, 287:411 (1980);
Streuli et al., Science, 209:1343 (1980)]. However,
genetically engineered interferons are composed of only a
single species, which is not post-translationally modified
at all or identically to the natural interferons, and which
may limit the biological activity of the composition. For
example, IFN-α2 is the sole species in the products Intron®
A (IFN alfa-2b) [Schering Plough] and Roferon® A (IFN alfa-2a)
[Hoffman-La Roche].Interferons derived from natural sources, such as
those from human lymphoblastoid, Namalwa, cell line
[Mizrahi, Meth. Enzymol., 78:54 (1981); Phillips et al.,
Meth. Enzymol., 119:35 (1986)], and those from human
peripheral blood leukocytes [Mogensen et al., Pharmacol.
Ther. Part C, 1:369 (1977); Cantell et al., Methods
Enzymol., 78:29 (1981); Horowitz, Methods Enzymol.,
