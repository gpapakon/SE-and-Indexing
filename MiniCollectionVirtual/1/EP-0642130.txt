<ABSTRACT>
A data recording disk drive a low-flying air-bearing slider that 
is also able to be in contact and near contact with the lubricant film 

on the disk. The slider has a front air-bearing surface in the form of 
a pair of equally-spaced air-bearing pads 25, 27, a rear air-bearing pad 

29, and a central nonair-bearing recessed surface 28 which separates the 
front and rear air-bearing pads. The two front pads have a surface area 

greater than that of the rear pad and thus provide a positive pitch up 
of the slider. This causes the rear pad to also be pitched up so that 

air can flow beneath the rear pad to generate an air bearing in the rear 
portion of the slider. The presence of the central nonair-bearing 

region eliminates any lift in the central part of the slider, which 
allows for the low-flying height. The flying height of the rear pad of 

the slider above the disk is controlled by the width of the rear air-bearing 
pad. The rear pad has its leading edge 31 wider than its 

trailing edge 33 so that it is able to withstand contact with the 
lubricant film on the disk, typically at the lower disk velocities near 

the disk inside diameter, without generating unacceptable drag forces or 
depleting the lubricant from the disk. The rear pad also has a skewed 

leading edge which compensates for skew of the slider to minimize the 
flying height variation from the disk inside diameter to outside 

diameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data recording disk drives, and more
particularly to a head assembly for use, in such disk drives.Disk drives, also called disk files, are information storage
devices that use a rotatable disk with concentric data tracks containing
the information, a head or transducer for reading and/or writing data
onto the various tracks, and an actuator connected to a carrier for the
head for moving the head to the desired track and maintaining it over
the track centerline during read or write operations. There are
typically a plurality of disks separated by spacer rings and stacked on
a hub that is rotated by a disk drive motor. A housing supports the
drive motor and head actuator and surrounds the head and disk to provide
a substantially sealed environment for the head-disk interface.In conventional magnetic recording disk drives, the head carrier
is an air-bearing slider that rides on a bearing of air above the disk
surface when the disk is rotating at its operational speed. The slider
is maintained next to the disk surface by a relatively fragile
suspension that connects the slider to the actuator. The slider is
either biased toward the disk surface by a small spring force from the
suspension, or is "self-loaded" to the disk surface by means of a
"negative-pressure" air-bearing surface on the slider. Contact
start/stop (CSS) disk drives operate with the slider in contact with the
disk surface during start and stop operations when there is insufficient
disk rotational speed to maintain the air bearing. In contrast to CSS
disk drives, "load/unload" disk drives mechanically unload the slider
from the disk when the power is turned off, typically by means of a ramp
which contacts the suspension when the actuator is moved to a
predetermined location, and then load the slider back to the disk when
the disk has reached a speed sufficient to generate the air bearing.
Both types of disk drives maintain a relatively thin lubricant film on
the disk surface to prevent damage to the head and disk caused by any
contact between the head and disk. It has been known since the early days of magnetic recording that
minimizing the head-disk spacing is desirable because the amplitude of
the read signal from the disk increases with decreasing head-disk
spacing. Higher recording densities can thus be achieved. In
conventional, commercially available air-bearing disk drives the minimum
achievable head-disk spacing is typically between 1000-2000 Angstroms.
In addition, this spacing is not maintained constant,
