<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a substance which 
emits visible light when excited with infrared radiation 
and, more particularly, to an infrared light-excited light-emitting 
substance containing a transparent crystal adapted 
for use as a laser element for converting infrared laser 
light into visible laser light. Today, laser diodes have been put into practical use 
as light sources for optical communications. Laser diodes 
used in optical communications are designed to lase 
wavelengths of 1.33 µm and 1.55 µm which are lost only a 
little in quartz fibers. Also, laser dilode lasing 
wavelengths of approximately 780 nm have been extensively 
used in digital audio applications, laser printers, and 
other applications. On the other hand, infrared light 
having wavelengths longer than 780 nm is not visible and so 
laser elements emitting shorter wavelengths have been 
developed to make the laser light usable in the visible 
range. For example, compact visible laser light sources 
are required for high-density optical memories and 
displays. However, the wavelengths of laser diode which 
have been put into practical use today are approximately  
 
650 nm, i.e., red light. Laser diodes emitting shorter 
wavelengths of laser light, e.g., green light and blue 
light, have not been put into practical use. In this 
connection, attempts have been made to obtain shorter 
wavelengths of laser light by doubling the frequency by the 
use of second-harmonic generation. If this method is 
utilized, infrared laser light, for example, having a 
wavelength of 850 nm can be converted into blue light 
having a wavelength of 425 nm. Unfortunately, the 
difficulty of temperature control and expensiveness prevent 
practical compact SHG laser. Accordingly, an up-conversion laser for converting 
infrared diode laser light into blue or green laser light, 
by making use of an up-conversion phenomenon, is expected 
to be developed. It is reported that as a light-emitting 
device of this kind, up-conversion lasers have been 
successfully oscillated, using a single crystal of a 
fluoride such as YLiF₄:Er or heavy metal fluoride glass as 
typified by ZBLAN glass (Wilfried Lenth et al., Optics & 
Photonics News, 3, [3], 8-15 (1992)). However, the 
oscillation intensity is insufficient and far from 
practicability. To have laser oscillation of sufficient 
intensity, a material having a better light conversion 
efficiency is required. To satisfy this requirement, 
various glass materials have been developed, as disclosed  
 
in
