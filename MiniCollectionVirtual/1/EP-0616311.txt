<ABSTRACT>
A method of driving a matrix display device having an array 
of electro-optic display elements (12) each of which is connected 

in series with a two terminal non-linear device (15), such as a 
MIM, between associated row and column address conductors 

(16,17), in which the display elements are driven in a reset mode 
of operation by applying to the column address conductors data 

signals (D) and to the row address conductors selection signals 
(Vs) and reset signals (Va) to correct for non-uniformities in 

the characteristics of the non-linear devices, and in which in a 
row address period (Tl) a data signal (D) applied to a column 

conductor is preceded by its inverse (
D
), a reset signal (Va) is 
applied during the application of the inverse data signal, and a 

selection signal (Vs+) is applied during the application of the 
data signal in the latter part of the row address period in order 

to minimise differences in ageing of the non linear devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of driving a matrix
display device comprising sets of row and column address
conductors, a row and column array of electro-optic display
elements operable to produce a display, each of which is
connected in series with a two terminal non-linear device between
a row conductor and a column conductor, in which each row of
display elements is driven by applying during a respective row
address period a selection voltage signal to a row conductor to
select the row of display elements and data voltage signals to
the column conductors to drive each display element to produce a
required display effect, in which, prior to the application of a
selection voltage signal and a data voltage signal which are
operable to charge a selected display element to a voltage of
predetermined sign and magnitude at which the required display
effect is obtained, the display element is charged to an
auxiliary voltage of the same sign and greater magnitude. The
invention relates also to a matrix display device drivable by
such a method.The display device may be used to display alpha-numeric or
video information and the two terminal non-linear devices can be
of various forms, such as diode rings, back to back diodes, MIMs,
etc. which are bidirectional and substantially symmetrical. The
display elements, for example, liquid crystal display elements,
are addressed by sequentially applying a selection voltage
signals to each one of the first set of address conductors in
turn and applying in synchronised manner data signals to the
other set as appropriate to drive the display elements to a
desired display condition which is subsequently maintained until
they are again selected in a following field period.A method of driving a display device of the above kind is
described in US-A-5159325. In this method a five level row 
scanning signal is employed which includes a reset voltage signal
in addition to the usual selection signals and non-selection
(hold) levels. The selection and hold levels are polarity
inverted for successive fields and, together with the reset
voltage signal, which may be regarded as an additional selection
signal, require a five level signal waveform. Before presenting
a selection signal which together with the data signals provides
the display elements of a row with a voltage of a certain sign,
the display elements are charged through their non-linear devices
having an approximately symmetrical I-V characteristic to an
auxiliary voltage level of the same sign and which lies at or
beyon
