<ABSTRACT>
The invention is concerned with pumpable bread improver 
compositions comprising a liquid glyceride oil, in which 

solid fat particles are dispersed together with bread 
improver ingredients. The content of total solid 

particles of these compositions is at least 18 wt.%. 
The dispersed solid fat has a particle size of 0.01-0.05 

mm and preferably has a melting point of at least 40°C. 
Processes for the preparation of these compositions are 

also described. In one process, all ingredients are 
mixed and milled together at a specific temperature so 

that the particle size of the solid components will be 
less than 0.05 mm. In another process, the small fat 

particles are made separately by spray-crystallisation 
and are mixed with the rest of the milled bread improver 

composition, optionally in the form of a dispersion in a 
liquid oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fat-based bread improver 
compositions suitable for inclusion in culinary mixes for 
baking, particularly for bread recipes. Bread improver compositions include a variety of additives 
intended to improve the quality of bread and other bakers' 
goods, for example cake mixes, and for leavened and 
unleavened baked products generally. They include 
emulsifiers, enzymes, antioxidants, sugars, food acids and 
acidity regulators, milk solids and vitamins and may be 
accompanied by a proportion of flour to facilitate 
admixture with remaining bakery ingredients consisting 
largely of flour. Fats and/or liquid glyceride oils are 
also generally present. For ease of dispensing into the 
baking mix, quite a lot of sugar may be present, according 
to the recipe followed. The convenience to the baker of including baking 
ingredients such as sugar in the additive composition, is 
offset by the consistency of the resultant composition, 
which is often a pasty mass difficult to distribute 
uniformly in the flour mix prepared by the baker. The 
present invention provides a pumpable bread improver 
composition which is readily dispersed with simple mixing 
equipment. Bailey (Industrial Oil And Fat Products, 3rd Edition 
(1964), 313)) discloses that commercial fluid shortenings 
contain between 5 and 10% of fully hydrogenated fat in the 
β-crystalline form. US 2 521 242 describes shortenings 
having a pumpable consistency and containing 16 to 60%  
 
formation of β-crystals. In US 2 815 286 shortenings 
containing 2 to 10% partial glycerides of saturated fatty 
acids are described which are pourable at 15.6°C (60°F). USP 2 
846 312 discloses stirring plastic shortenings until a 
stable fluid is obtained. In US 3 395 023 liquid 
shortenings are prepared by gradually cooling a mixture of 
fatty acid triglycerides to form a slurry which is then 
comminuted to provide a maximum particle size not more 
than 15 µm. According to JP 53009351 fluid shortenings can be obtained 
by adding powdery fatty acid ester of a size of more than 
50 mesh to fluid oil and fat, containing 3-30% of 
crystallised solid triglycerides. The fluid shortening can 
also contain 0.5-1.0% of an emulsifier. The shortening can 
be applied in bread preparation in order to increase the 
bread volume and to improve the texture. US 4,234,606 discloses stabilized fluid shortenings, 
containing conditioning agents and softening agents; these 
shortenings comprise 4-10 wt% of soft or hard mono- and 
diglycerides, 2-8 wt% of ethoxylated
