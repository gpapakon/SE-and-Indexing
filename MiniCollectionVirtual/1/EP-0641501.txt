<ABSTRACT>
A variable reluctance drive system including a motor and corresponding converter for improved current commutation. The motor incorporates a salient pole rotor (16) and a salient pole stator (10) having one or more full pitch windings (20) which operate by mutual inductance to transfer the current from the active short pitch winding following phase alignment (each short pitch winding comprising two short pitch coils A1-2, B1-2 or C1-2). This increases output torque and/or speed and permits a number of simple and economical converter circuits (Figs. 7-11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to variable reluctance machines 
and, more particularly, to a high specific output variable 
reluctance drive system incorporating a motor having one or 
two full-pitch windings for improving current commutation and 
a special purpose solid state power converter. In variable reluctance motors, torque is generated by a 
rotor and stator which tend to align themselves in order to 
reach a position of minimum magnetic reluctance. One type of 
variable reluctance motor is the stepping motor, which 
delivers an incremental rotation as the result of a pulsed 
input. Stepping motors are now widely used in microprocessor 
and digital control systems and other systems requiring a low 
output incremental drive. Variable reluctance motors have also found limited use in 
higher power applications such as fan drives, pumps, traction 
systems, motion control systems, appliances, and general 
purpose variable speed drives. Such applications call for 
continuous drive motors, and this poses a problem for variable 
reluctance motors. The current in each phase of the motor 
should be decreased to zero rapidly when the rotor becomes 
aligned with that phase. Otherwise, negative torque will 
develop and will compromise the efficiency of the motor. It 
is difficult to accomplish this instantaneous current 
reduction in a variable reluctance motor because the phase 
inductance is a maximum when the rotor is aligned with that 
phase. The problem is most serious when the speed of the 
motor is high. The prior art uses one of the following two brute force 
approaches to reduce the current at alignment: 
(1) a negative voltage is applied to the phase winding 
in order to extract the energy trapped in the magnetic field 
and transfer it to an external storage device such as a 
battery or capacitor; or  
 (2) the phase is switched off before the rotor reaches 
alignment and the energy trapped in the magnetic field is 
dissipated in a resistor connected to the phase winding 
through a diode.  Unfortunately, the first technique increases the VA 
rating and cost of the switching device (a.k.a. converter). 
Also, the large back-and-forth energy flow between the motor 
and source causes extra motor and converter losses and creates 
a need for a large DC bus capacitor. The second technique reduces the output torque and 
efficiency of the motor. US-A-4500824 discloses another technique for 
commutating the phases of a variable reluctance motor. These drawbacks account for the lack of commercial 
acceptance of
