<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of staple fibres according to which glass fibres made up of continuous filaments coated with a nonaqueous sizing, in the liquid state and capable of reacting under the action of an actinic radiation, are chopped by a member (1, 2) also used for drawing them or for entraining them mechanically before being subjected to an actinic radiation. The invention also relates to a device for implementing the abovementioned process.

<CLAIMS>
Process for manufacturing cut threads
according to which glass threads composed of continuous

filaments coated with a non-aqueous size, that is a
size composition comprising less than 10% water, which

size is in the liquid state and capable of reacting
under the effect of actinic radiation, are cut by a

member also used for drawing them or entraining them
mechanically before being subjected to actinic

radiation.
Process according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the cut threads are subjected to

the effect of actinic radiation after cutting and
before being collected on a receiver member.
Process according to either of Claims 1
and 2, characterized in that the cut threads are

collected on a receiver member and are then subjected
to the effect of at least one actinic radiation

process.
Process according to either of Claims 2
and 3, characterized in that the cut threads are

subjected to the effect of actinic radiation between
the receiver member and a second receiver member on

which they are collected. 
Process according to any one of Claims 2
to 4, characterized in that the cut threads are

collected on a second receiver member and are then
subjected to the effect of at least one actinic

radiation process.
Process according to any one of Claims 2
to 5, characterized in that the cut threads are

subjected to the effect of actinic radiation on at
least one receiver member.
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the cut threads are subjected to the effect of

actinic radiation on the receiver member whilst they
pass over a blower member.
Process according to any one of Claims 2 to 7,
characterized in that the first receiver member is

subjected to vibrations.
Device for performing the process as defined in
the preceding Claims, comprising at least one cutting

and fibre-drawing member or a member for cutting and
entraining the sized threads, at least one member for

receiving the cut threads, said cut threads falling
simply by gravity from one member to another, and at

least one source of actinic radiation directed towards
one of the areas in which the cut threads fall from one

member to another and/or a source of actinic radiation 
directed towards an area of a receiver member and

associated with at least one blower member located
below this area.
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that it comprises two sources of actinic radiation, the

first being between the cutting and fibre-drawing
member or the cutting and entraining member and a

receiver member and the second being directed towards
an area of a receiver member.
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that it comprises two receiver members and a source of

actinic radiation located between the two receiver
members.
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that it comprises a source of actinic radiation

directed towards an area of a receiver member and
associated with a blower member located below this

area, the source of actinic radiation being protected
by a silica plate and surrounded by a caisson for

evacuating the gaseous currents.
Device according to any one of Claims 9 to 12,
characterized in that the receiver member or members is

or are metal conveyors. 
Device according to any one of Claims 9 to 13,
characterized in that the receiver member located below

the cutting and fibre-drawing member or below the
cutting and entraining member is moved by a vibrating

motion.
