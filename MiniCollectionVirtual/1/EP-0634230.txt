<ABSTRACT>
A high-speed bottle washing machine provides 
concurrent rotational motion to a workpiece as it is 

conveyed through a washing treatment zone for internal and 
external spray treatments. The machine comprises a 

plurality of moving bottle receiving stations for 
sequentially receiving and rotating inverted bottles 

received from a bottle infeed conveyor, a plurality of 
reciprocating spray nozzles, with at least one spray 

nozzle moving with each bottle receiving station, wherein 
each of the spray nozzles reciprocates from a first 

position below the inverted bottles, to a second position 
within the bottles, and a manifold assembly for 

sequentially supplying a caustic wash fluid under pressure 
to each of the plurality of spray nozzles to clean the 

bottles by impingement of the wash fluid in a 
predetermined pattern within the bottles as the bottles 

are rotated. The washed bottles are finally discharged at 
a bottle outfeed conveyor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
automatic high-speed bottle washer and spraying systems.
More particularly, the present invention is directed to an
automatic high-speed bottle washing machine for washing
and sanitizing plastic returnable bottles (PRB) and a
spray nozzle and orifice assembly. The novel spray nozzle
assembly of the present invention is designed to discharge
highly directional pressurized jets of cleaning fluid such
that, when positioned in an inverted rotatable bottle,
maximum cleansing of the bottle or container is
accomplished.The manufacture of returnable and refillable
bottles has become widespread in both the glass and
plastic bottling industries. Many countries have mandated
their use in an effort to conserve energy and to keep raw
material consumption to a minimum. Furthermore,
commercially viable, refillable bottles and containers not
only conserve energy, but help to reduce land-fill and
recycling problems usually associated with disposable type
plastic and glass bottles and containers. One industry in
particular where the desirability of utilizing plastic
reusable and refillable bottles (PRB's) is increasing, is
in the soft drink beverage industry.To be commercially viable as a refillable bottle
for soft drink beverages, the PRB must retain its
aesthetic and functional qualities over a minimum of ten
and preferably over twenty cycles or "trips" in its
lifetime. A typical cycle that a returnable/refillable
plastic bottle goes through has been described in numerous
patents and technical articles. For instance, U.S. Patent 
No. 4,725,464 to Collette, describes a cycle as
comprising: 1) an empty caustic wash followed by 2)
contaminant inspection and product filling/capping, 3)
warehouse storage, 4) distribution to wholesale and retail
locations, and 5) purchase, use, and empty storage by the
consumer followed by eventual return to the bottler.
Presently, plastic beverage bottles made of polyesters,
such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and copolymers
thereof, acrylonitrile, and polycarbonate have the
requisite physical and aesthetic qualities most desirable
for producing refillable plastic containers. As is well
known in the art, PET offers the best balance of
properties and, cost and performance ratios.While the plastic bottling industry has made
great strides in obviating the problems associated with
cleaning and washing of the PRBs during a typical cycle,
problems still exist with currently existing bottle
washing machines. For instance, many of the existing
machines
