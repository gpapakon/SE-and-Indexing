<ABSTRACT>
To provide a construction for ejecting a function-aid unit which 
has the advantages of simplicity in construction, the number of fewer 

parts, easy assemble, and easy down-sizing and an information processing 
system having such a construction for ejection. A construction is 

disclosed for ejecting a function-aid unit according to the present 
invention is intended to eject a function-aid unit which can be connected 

or disconnected to or from a connector on the side of an opposed 
apparatus from said apparatus, and provides an extracting member for 

moving said function-aid unit so that said function-aid unit is pulled 
out of said connector and a rotating body for causing said function-aid 

unit to be extracted from said connector by moving said extracting member 
from the outside of said opposed apparatus. Further, an information 

processing system according to the present invention provides a cabinet 

enclosing at least main part of electronic circuits, an opening provided 
on said cabinet, an enclosure section for enclosing a function-aid unit 

inserted in said cabinet from said opening, a connector for electrically 
connecting to said function-aid unit within said enclosure section, an 

extracting member for pulling said function-aid unit out of said 
connector by moving said function-aid unit enclosed in said enclosure 

section, and a rotating body which is supported rotatably on said cabinet 
and causes said function-aid unit to be extracted from said connector by 

action on said extracting member when turned from the outside of said 
cabinet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assembly for ejecting 
function-aid units such as a card-type extended IC memory, a card-type 
hard disk apparatus, a modem card, a communication adapter card, etc. 
which can be attached or detached to or from an apparatus such as an 
information processing system, from said apparatus. Nowadays, attachable or detachable card-type function-aid units are 
widely used in a notebook personal computers and standardization for 
achieving the uniformity of such function-aid units is in the process of 
being established. In a conventional construction for ejecting a 
function-aid unit, an eject button generally protrudes from near a slot 
of the function-aid unit and said function-aid unit is ejected from the 
slot through a mechanism using an internal lever or the like, when the 
eject button is pressed. However, such a construction has the 
disadvantages of complexity in construction, a requirement for a large 
number of parts, and great difficulty in assembly and down-sizing. An object of the present invention is to provide a construction for 
ejecting a function-aid unit which has the advantage of greater 
simplicity in construction, fewer parts, easier assembly, and easy down-sizing 
and an information processing system having such a construction 
for ejection. To achieve this the invention provides an assembly for ejecting a 
function-aid unit which can be connected or disconnected to or from a 
connector on the side of an apparatus from the apparatus, comprising: 
a movably mounted extraction member for moving said function-aid unit so 
that the function-aid unit is pulled out of said connector; and 
a rotatably mounted member for causing said function-aid unit to be 
extracted from said connector by moving said extraction member when 
rotated with respect to the apparatus. To attain said object, a construction for ejecting a function-aid 
unit according to the present invention is intended to eject a function-aid 
unit which can be connected or disconnected to or from a connector on 
the side of an opposed apparatus from said apparatus, and provides an 
extracting member for moving said function-aid unit so that said 
function-aid unit is pulled out of said connector and a rotating body for  
 
causing said function-aid unit to be extracted from said connector by 
moving said extracting member when turned from the outside of said 
opposed apparatus. The invention also provides an information processing system having 
a cabinet enclosing at least main part of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An assembly for ejecting a function-aid unit (10) which can be 
connected or disconnected to or from a connector (26) on the side of an 

apparatus from the apparatus, comprising: 
a movably mounted extraction member (30) for moving said function-aid 

unit so that the function-aid unit is pulled out of said connector; and 
a rotatably mounted member (18) for causing said function-aid unit to be 

extracted from said connector by moving said extraction member (30) when 
rotated with respect to the apparatus. 
An assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein the extraction member 
(30) is movably supported in the apparatus along the direction in which 

the function-aid unit is extracted, and said rotatably mounted member 
(18) is supported on said apparatus such that a part thereof is exposed 

to the outside of the apparatus, the rotatably mounted member (18) being 
linked to the extraction member by a cam mechanism (40) for converting a 

rotation of the rotatably mounted member to a motion of the extraction 
member (30) in said direction. 
An assembly as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the extraction 
member (30) comprises a slider button (16) exposed to the outside of the 

apparatus for enabling the extraction member to be moved. 
An assembly as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the rotatably 
mounted member is adapted to be rotated by the edge of a coin. 
An information processing system comprising a cabinet (2) enclosing 
electronic circuits, the cabinet being provided with an opening for 

receiving a function aid unit, and comprising an enclosure section for 
enclosing a function aid unit inserted into the opening; a connector in 

said enclosure section for electrically connecting to a function-aid unit 
and an assembly as claimed in any preceding claim for ejecting a 

function-aid unit from the connector. 
An information processing system as claimed in claim 6 wherein the 
enclosure section is capable of enclosing a plurality of function aid 

units and said extracting member is arranged to cause the plurality of 
function-aid units to be extracted from the connector by operating 

 
simultaneously on the plurality of function-aid units within the 

enclosure section. 
An information processing system as claimed in claim 5 or claim 6 
wherein part of said rotatably mounted member is exposed on the bottom 

surface of the cabinet so that the rotatably mounted member may be
