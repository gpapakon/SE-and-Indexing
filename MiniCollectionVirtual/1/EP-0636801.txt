<ABSTRACT>
The locknut has a ring disc (10) with recesses (12a-c) formed in it. Between the recesses, claws (14a-c) with mainly radial side walls (19) are formed. These hold the ring disc in a ring groove via friction. Between the claws, the recesses and the remaining disc material form ring sections (24a-c), which have the same circumferential dimensions as the claws. The ring sections have even radial width (a), or the width decreases towards the centre. There are three or five claws, and they have formed chamfers (16a-c). The depth of each chamfer is the same as, or smaller than, the max. radial depth (T) of a recess.

<CLAIMS>
A locknut with a screwthreaded portion having an
internal screwthread, a following internal annular

groove (43) and an annular washer (10; 50) which is
held frictionally in the annular groove in the

peripheral direction, an internal screwthread (51)
corresponding to the internal screwthread (45) of the

screwthreaded portion being cut at the inner periphery
of the annular washer and the internal screwthread of

the annular washer being offset relatively to the
internal screwthread of the locknut, by axial

deformation into a conical shape, the amount of the
offset (x) being less than a screwthread pitch, and a

plurality of recesses (12a, 12b, 12c; 52a to 52e) is
formed in the periphery of the annular washer, being

distributed uniformly thereover, characterised in that
radially projecting claws (14a, 14a, 14c; 54a to 54e)

are formed between the recesses, the annular washer
(10, 50) being frictionally held in the annular groove

(43) via said claws, in that the recesses (12a, 12b,
12c; 52a to 52e) between the claws co-operate with the

remaining annular washer material to form ring portions
(24a, 24b, 24c; 26b, 26c; 56a to 56e) of at least equal

peripheral dimensions to the claws, and in that notches
(16a, 16b, 16c) are formed in the claws (14a, 14b,

14c).
A locknut according to the preamble of claim 1,
characterised in that narrow radially projecting notchfree

claws (54a to 54e) are formed between the
recesses, via which claws (54a to 54e) the annular

washer (50) is held frictionally in the annular groove
(43), in that the recesses (52a to 52e) between the 

claws together with the remaining annular washer
material form ring portions (56a to 56e) of larger

peripheral dimensions than the claws, and in that the
claws (54a to 54e) are provided with a groove (58) or

flat.
A locknut according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the ring portions (24a, 24b, 24c) have a

constant radial width 
a
 over their peripheral extent
(Fig. 1).
A locknut according to claim 1 or 2, chracterised
in that the ring portions (26a, 26b, 26c) have a

decreasing radial width 
a
' in the peripheral direction
starting from their points of attachment to the claws

(14a, 14b, 14c) as far as their centre (Fig. 2).
A locknut according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that three claws (14a, 14b, 14c) are

distributed over the periphery.
A locknut according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that five claws are distributed over

the periphery.
A locknut according to claim 1, characterised in
that the depth (t) of the notches (16a, 16b, 16c) is

substantially equal to or smaller than the maximum
radial depth (T) of a recess (12a, 12b, 12c).
A locknut according to claim 1 or 7, characterised
in that each notch (16a, 16b, 16c) has a clearance (b)

between its parallel side walls (18) of between one-third 
and one-quarter of the peripheral extent of a

claw.
A locknut according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the thickness of the

locking annular washer (10) corresponds to one
screwthread pitch of the internal screwthread.
A locknut according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the maximum radial depth

(T) of the recesses (12a, 12b, 12c) is one-half to one-third
of the maximum radial width (A) of the annular

washer (10).
A locknut according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the incision edges (19)

of the recesses extend substantially radially.
A locknut according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the claws (54a to 54c)

are thinned down over their entire peripheral extent
and over at least a partial zone of their radial extent

in order to increase the elasticity.
A locknut according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the locknut annular

washer (10) consists of spring material, more
particularly spring band steel.
