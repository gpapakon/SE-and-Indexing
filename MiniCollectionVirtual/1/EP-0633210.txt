<ABSTRACT>
A method and device whereby a first runout strip 
(3), fed at a first speed (V1) along a guide (12) by a 

traction device (13), is replaced with a new strip (33) 
by: 


cutting the first strip (3); 
activating both a push 
device (9,49), by which the new strip (33) is engaged 

and fed along the guide (12) at a second speed (V2), and 
a movable guide device (17) defining a portion of the 

guide (12) and which is lowered in relation to the rest 
of the guide (12) and together with a trailing portion 

(92) of the first strip on the movable guide device (17) 
itself; 
controlling the second speed (V2) as a 
function of the first speed (V1) so that a leading 

portion (91) of the new strip (33) is superimposed on 
the trailing portion (92) of the first strip (3) along 

the movable guide device (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
changing strip material on a production machine. The present invention may be applied to advantage 
to packing machines in general, and to cigarette packing 
machines in particular, to which the following 
description refers purely by way of example. For special purposes, such as the formation of 
collars or internal reinforcing elements of hinged-lid 
packets, cigarette packing machines employ relatively 
rigid strip material normally fed off a reel. When a reel of said strip material runs out, the 
machine is normally stopped, and the runout reel is 
replaced with a new reel, the leading end of the strip 
of which is connected manually by the operator to the 
trailing end of the runout strip. Such a system obviously involves considerable 
downtime and constant supervision by an operator of each 
packing machine. To overcome the above drawback, a method,  
 
described and illustrated in US-A-5101 701, 
has been proposed enabling the runout reel 
to be replaced automatically with a new reel. Though highly effective, implementation of the 
above known method requires a relatively large-size 
automatic device in turn requiring relatively accurate 
adjustment for it to operate correctly. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a method of replacing a runout strip with a new 
strip, with no manual assistance required and, above 
all, without stopping the packing machine. In particular, it is an object of the present 
invention to perfect the above known method to eliminate 
the aforementioned drawbacks. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of changing strip material comprising 
two strips, a first of said strips being connected to 
traction means by which it is drawn and fed at a first 
given speed along a given path; the method comprising 
stages consisting in cutting the first strip; and, upon 
passage of the trailing portion of the first strip 
through a given point along said path, in pushing the 
second of said strips along said path at a second given 
speed; characterized in that it also comprises stages 
consisting in shifting said trailing portion of the 
first strip in relation to a portion of said path; 
controlling the second speed as a function of the first 
speed, so that the leading portion of the second strip  
 
reaches, and is superimposed on, the trailing portion of 
the first strip at said portion of said path; and 
restoring said trailing portion, superimposed with said 
leading portion, to said path.

<CLAIMS>
A method of changing strip material comprising 
two strips (3, 33), a first (3) of said strips (3, 33) 

being connected to traction means (13) by which it is 
drawn and fed at a first given speed (V1) along a given 

path (P); the method comprising stages consisting in 
cutting the first strip (3); and, upon passage of the 

trailing portion (92) of the first strip (3) through a 
given point along said path (P), in pushing the second 

(33) of said strips (3, 33) along said path (P) at a 
second given speed (V2); characterized in that it also 

comprises stages consisting in shifting said trailing 
portion (92) of the first strip (3) in relation to an aligned 

portion (P1) of said path (P); controlling the second 
speed (V2) as a function of the first speed (V1), so 

that the leading portion (91) of the second strip (33) 
reaches, and is superimposed on, the trailing portion 

(92) of the first strip (3) at said portion (P1) of said 
path (P); and restoring said trailing portion (92), 

superimposed with said leading portion (91), to said 
path (P). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
in that it comprises a further stage consisting in 

controlling the second speed (V2), subsequent to 
superimposing said trailing (92) and leading (91) 

portions, so that the leading (91) and trailing (92) 
portions remain in said superimposed position on being  

 
engaged by said traction means (13). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said path (P) is defined by guide 

means (12) comprising a movable guide device (17) 
defining a portion (18) of the guide means (12) at said 

portion (P1) of said path (P); said trailing portion 
(92) being moved to and from said path (P) by 

respectively raising and lowering said movable guide 
device (17) in relation to the path (P) simultaneously 

with the passage of said trailing portion (92) on the 
movable guide device (17).
