<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide light-sensitive material containing a 
compound represented by formula (I): 


wherein variables in the above formula (I) are defined in the 
specification. The silver halide light-sensitive material has 

a small fluctuation in a sensitivity even when the processing 
temperature changes and has an improved color reproduction and 

an excellent discrimination and can achieve low Dmin and high 
Dmax.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide light-sensitive
material, more specifically to a diffusible dye-providing
compound used for the above light-sensitive material.A process for forming an image with a diffusion
transfer type silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material can be classified to two processes. One is a process
in which a design is made so that diffusibility of a dye
molecule itself is changed corresponding with a developing
reaction of silver halide exposed, and the other is a process
in which a design is made so that a diffusible dye is
incorporated into a light-sensitive material as a dye-providing
material immobilized by a ballast group and is released from
the dye-providing material corresponding or inversely
corresponding with the developing reaction of silver halide.There are known as a process by which the diffusible
dye is released from the dye-providing material, a process
using a coupling reaction of an oxidation product of a
developing agent with a dye-releasing coupler having the
diffusible dye as a splitting group, a process using a
diffusible dye-releasing redox compound having a nature that a
bond between a diffusible dye portion and a redox primary
nucleus portion immobilized by a ballast group is split, and a 
compound releasing a diffusible dye by an interaction with a
silver ion. These diffusible dye-providing compounds can be
classified to a negatively active compound which releases the
diffusible dye corresponding with a development of silver
halide by a relation with a silver developing reaction and a
positively active compound which releases the dye diffusible
dye inversely corresponding with the development.
There are known as the examples of the negatively active
compound in a diffusible dye-releasing redox compound,
sulfonamide phenols disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,928,312,
4,135,929, 4,053,312, 4,336,322, and 4,055,428, the compounds

means an unexamined published Japanese patent application) and
