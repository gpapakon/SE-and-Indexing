<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the repair and rehabilitation of concrete
structures which have been weakened due to corrosion of steel embedded
therein. Particularly, the invention relates to a method for halting steel corrosion
in weakened concrete whereby a solution of novel composition is applied to a
smooth, or scarified concrete structural surface.The present invention is directed to a method of rehabilitating and
stabilizing salt-contaminated reinforced concrete structures, and a novel
composition used in the method.It is well known that reinforced concrete structures, such as bridges,
parking garages, and the like are highly susceptible to corrosion and degradation
from commonly applied chloride deicing salts. It is believed that a large
percentage of all bridge decks in the United States, and in other countries which
have cold climates, are seriously deteriorated because of corrosion of the
reinforcing steel which is part of their structure. This corrosion is usually caused
by chloride ions that have penetrated the concrete as a result of repeated
application of deicing salts. The mechanism by which this corrosion and
degradation occurs may be explained as follows:Under highly alkaline conditions the reinforcing steel has formed upon it
an oxidized film of γ-Fe2O3, which inhibits the corrosion of the steel material; the
steel is thus said to have been "passivated". However, when chloride ions are
introduced into the cementitious matrix, the passivated film is broken. (In
concrete parking structures, for example, automobiles carry salt-contaminated ice 
and snow to the structure and, while parked, allow the contaminated ice and
snow to melt, concentrating the salt on the concrete structure.) The breakage of
the film generally occurs locally to expose the steel material. As a result, the
smaller exposed part of the steel surface acts as an anode, and the larger portion,
still covered by the passivated film, acts as a cathode to cause a large potential
difference between them and, therefore, only the anode (smaller part) is
corroded. As a result, so-called "pitting corrosion" takes place in spots on the
surface of the steel.The effective sectional area of the steel material is rapidly reduced by the
pitting corrosion and such corrosion is therefore dangerous, even when the
number of the spots is small. When the number of pits increases, they
interconnect to finally spread all over the steel surface. In the initial stages of
corrosion, ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2) is formed. This compound is
