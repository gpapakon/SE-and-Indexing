<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming packaged hand-held solidificable food products, in particular ice-creams, characterised by: forming from ice-cream impermeable material an openable enclosure (4, 29) provided with at least one aperture (6, 31) for feeding an ice-cream compound into it, filling said enclosure (4, 29) with the ice-cream compound, hermetically sealing said filled enclosure (4, 29), and cooling the thus filled and sealed enclosure until said compound has completely solidified.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for forming packaged 
solidificable food products, in particular hand-held ice-creams 
and a container for implementing the process. Hand-held ice-creams are currently produced by pouring 
the ice-cream compound, of liquid or semi-liquid consistency 
depending on the final product to be obtained, into a 
plurality of metal moulds maintained in a brine bath. Before 
the compound in the moulds completely solidifies, a stick of 
wood or plastics or edible material (sugar, liquorice etc.) 
is inserted into each of them so that when the compound has 
completely solidified the stick remains securely fixed to it. 
The ice-cream obtained in this manner is then extracted from 
the corresponding mould and deposited on a conveyor belt to 
be fed for packaging within a suitable paper container. This known process was previously carried out manually 
but is now performed by rather sophisticated machines which 
although able to automate the production cycle suffer from a 
series of drawbacks and limitations which it is the object of 
the present invention to overcome. One drawback of this known process is that it requires 
rather complicated and costly equipment (the moulds) which 
inter alia has to be changed each time the shape of the 
produced ice-cream is to be varied.  
 A further drawback is that equally complicated and 
costly equipment is required for inserting the stick into the 
mould, and as this insertion has to be effected at a precise 
point during the ice-cream solidifying stage, the processing 
times have to be rigorously controlled, these varying in 
relation to the shape of the ice-cream to be obtained and the 
ice-cream compound used. A further drawback is that the transfer of the ice-cream 
to the packaging machine after extraction from the mould can 
involve problems regarding the rigorous maintaining of 
hygienic conditions, because of the exposure of the product 
to the external environment. A further drawback is that the shape of the ice-cream 
obtainable and hence of the mould used to produce it is 
subject to considerable limitations, in that undercuts must 
be totally avoided as they would prevent correct removal of 
the ice-cream from the mould. A further drawback is that during the consumption of the 
ice-cream, ie when the protective wrapper has been removed 
from the ice-cream and this is held by the consumer only by 
the stick, the hand of the consumer can be soiled because of 
the inevitable dripping of those parts of the ice-cream which

<CLAIMS>
A process for forming packaged hand-held solidificable 
food products, in particular ice-creams, characterised by: 


forming from ice-cream impermeable material an openable 
enclosure (4,29) provided with at least one aperture (6,31) 

for feeding an ice-cream compound into it and with an 
outwardly projecting appendix (8) forming a gripping 

element for the packaged ice-cream, 
providing said enclosure (4) with separating means for an 
upper part removable from a lower part (20) rigid with the 

gripping appendix (8), said lower part (20) being provided 
with at least one inwardly projecting appendix for locking 

said ice-cream (12), 
filling said enclosure (4,29) with the ice-cream compound, 
hermetically sealing said filled enclosure (4,29), and 
cooling the thus filled and sealed enclosure until said 
compound has completely solidified. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterised by 
providing the enclosure (4) with tear-off means for opening 

it. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that at 
least two walls of the enclosure are partly connected each 

other to, to lock the solified product.  
 
A process as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that, 
before hermetically sealing the filled enclosure (29), 

through the opening (31) an appendix (32) is inserted a part 
of which is embedded in the ice-cream compound. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterised by 
simultaneously filling a plurality of side-by-side enclosure 

(4). 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterised by 
sealing the enclosure (4), filled with ice-cream compound, by 

welding the contacting edges of said aperture (6). 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterised by 
sealing the enclosure (4), filled with ice-cream compound, by 

means of a cap applied to the aperture (6). 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterised by 
cooling the enclosure (4) immediately after it has been 

filled and sealed. 
A container for implementing the process claimed in one
