<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fastening device for securing straps, bands or loops to the edges of planar workpieces, in particular isomats. In order to be able to secure straps, bands and loops to the edge of workpieces in a simple manner, the edge being protected at the same time, a fastening device consists of a central part (12) and two side parts (14, 16) which are linked movably thereto. Arranged in the central part (12) or adjoining the central part is at least one slot-shaped cutout (18) to receive the strap, band or loop. Finally, the fastening device can be connected to the planar workpiece via the side parts.
