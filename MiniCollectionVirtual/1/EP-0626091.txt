<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic 
recording media and particularly to improved magnetic 
recording media comprising a backside coating derived 
from high molecular weight block copolymers. Flexible magnetic recording media generally 
comprise a magnetic coating supported upon a 
nonmagnetic support. The quality of magnetically 
recorded and reproduced signals depends upon precise, 
accurate tracking of the media during transport (i.e., 
during playback, recording, fast forward, and rewind). 
Any irregularities in tracking will adversely affect 
the recording and reproduction of magnetically recorded 
signals. Additionally, magnetic recording media must 
be durable so that it is possible to record and play 
back information repeatedly. In view of these 
concerns, a backside coating may also be applied to the 
nonmagnetic support in order to improve the 
conductivity, durability, and tracking characteristics 
of the media. One factor affecting tracking characteristics 
relates to the surface roughness of the backside 
coating. If the surface is too smooth, air tends to 
become trapped under the magnetic recording medium as 
it moves. When this happens, tracking is difficult to 
control, because the entrapped air causes the tension  
 
of the medium to vary considerably. Tape slippage 
usually results. To avoid this problem, the surface of 
backside coatings are made with a rough texture to 
allow air to escape from under the moving tape. For example, US-A-4,328,935 describes 
a backside coating whose surface has a rough texture. 
This rough texture is achieved through the use of 
relatively large, "equant" particles. However, using 
large particles to achieve a rough texture has 
disadvantages. In particular, the relatively large 
particles tend to press into the magnetic coating, 
leaving indentations in the magnetic coating when the 
medium is subsequently surface treated and/or stored as 
a roll or wound on a reel. As a result, those 
electromagnetic properties of the media which depend 
upon the smoothness of the magnetic coating, e.g., the 
signal to noise ratio, sensitivity, maximum output 
level, and the like tend to deteriorate. US-A-4,645,723 describes a backside 
coating having a rough texture, but does not use 
relatively large particles to achieve such texture. 
Rather, the backside coating is produced from a 
solution of two or more binder components, which are 
incompatible with one another, in a solvent mixture. 
The solvent mixture consists of two or more solvents 
which boil at
