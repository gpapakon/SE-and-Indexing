<ABSTRACT>
Injector for introducing an object such as a transponder (2) in a 
livin being. Through the arrangement of a sharpened tip (4) on the 

transponder the opening in the skin of the living being is realized by 
the transponder itself and not by any sharpened needle point of the 

injector tube (5). This means that the circumferential end edge of the 
transponder can be blunt. The tip of the transponder comprises a 

bio-compatible, preferably bio-degradable, material in which possibly a 
medication is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an injector for introducing 
an object, such as a transponder, in a living being, comprising 
a housing to which an injector tube is connected for receiving 
and guiding the object. Such an injector is generally known in the art. 
Objects, such as transponders are injected in animals, e.g. 
for identification purposes. The opening in the skin of the 
animal is realized in that the tip of the injector tube is 
sharpened. This generally means that the injector is a hollow 
needle of which the end face is sharpened to provide an opening.Because 
of that during non-use there is a substantial 
danger that the operators using the injector can hurt themselves 
or others through the tip of the needle. To prevent 
these problems it is proposed that the needle is retractable. 
However, due to the dirt and the nature of the skin of several 
animals high requirements are set to the material from 
which the needle tip is realized. Often wear takes place 
after a relative low number of transponders has been injected 
such that the force to protrude the skin will increase and 
the accuracy of placing of the transponder will decrease. 
Furthermore there is the problem of cross contamination 
between animals through the needle tip. The invention aims to provide an improved injector 
which can be used together with a new transponder to avoid 
the drawbacks relating to the presence of a sharp needle tip. According to the invention this is realized in that 
the free extremity of the injector tube comprises a blunt 
circumferential edge. The invention also relates to an 
transponder comprising an elongated body. According to the invention this object is characterized 
in that in front of the body a sharpened tip is 
provided. The invention is based on the idea that the object to 
be injected itself is provided with a sharp tip so that it is 
not longer necessary that an opening is provided in the living 
being with the injector tube. The injector tube only acts 
as guide for the transponder to be introduced. This means 
that the free extremity of the injector tube can be blunt so  
 
that in the position of non use it is completely safe and no 
separate costly measures have to be taken to prevent that 
this end contacts the operators or other persons. On the 
other hand such a device is extremely simple. The tip of the 
transponder enters the living being together with the 
transponder member and is only used a single time. This means 
that the danger of cross contamination is reduced whilst 
abrasiv
