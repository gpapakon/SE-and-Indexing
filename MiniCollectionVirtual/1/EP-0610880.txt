<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a modem intended to equip transmitters/receivers connected to an alternating electrical distribution mains, and suitable, by means of a signal transported by the mains, for controlling the operation of electrical appliances of a dwelling, and comprising a coupling transformer (1) having a primary stage (2) connected to the terminals of the mains power supply and a secondary stage (3) connected by means of a linking circuit (4) to an input stage (7) and to an output stage (8) of a signal processing unit (5). According to the invention, the modem further comprises means for automatically changing its input impedance, driven by the said processing unit, so that the impedance is greater in reception than in transmission.
