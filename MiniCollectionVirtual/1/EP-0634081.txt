Process for signalling the call number in a 
telecommunication network, telecommunication connections 

being directed from telecommunication terminal equipment 
on the transmission side (A) via an origin node (ON), via 

transit nodes (TN1, ... TN7) to telecommunication terminal 
equipment on the reception side (B), the origin 

node (ON) being arranged in an area of closed numbering 
and there being inserted into first signalling 

information of the telecommunication connection to be set 
up a node number designating the origin node (ON), the 

call number of the telecommunication terminal equipment 
on the transmission side (A), a node identity number, 

assigned to the telecommunication terminal equipment on 
the reception side (B) and entered into the 

telecommunication terminal equipment on the transmission 
side (A), and the (B) call number, characterized in that 

in nodes (ON, TN1, ... DN) involved in the setup of the 
connection it is checked on the basis of the node number 

(KON) of the origin node (ON) and on the basis of the 
identity number (KDN) of the destination node (DN) 

whether the call number of the telecommunication terminal 
equipment on the transmission side (A) is to be modified, 

and in that the call number of the telecommunication 
terminal equipment on the transmission side (A) is 

supplemented in a node (TN4) in the area of closed 
numbering which neighbours an area of open numbering by 

the identity number designating the area of closed 
numbering and is not supplemented in the nodes (DN) of 

open numbering following the area of closed numbering by 
the identity numbers designating these nodes (DN, TN6).  

 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, after the setup of the telecommunication connection 

from the telecommunication terminal equipment on the 
transmission side (A) to the telecommunication terminal 

equipment on the reception side (B), second signalling 
information is formed, which is transmitted from the 

telecommunication terminal equipment on the reception 
side (B) to that on the transmission side (A) with the 

call number of the telecommunication terminal equipment 
on the reception side (B), in that in the nodes (DN, TN7, 

... ON) involved in the setup of the connection it is 
checked on the basis of the identity number (KDN) of the 

destination node (DN) and on the basis of the node number 
of the origin node (ON) whether the call number of the 

telecommunication terminal equipment on the reception 
side (B) is to be modified, and in that the call number 

of the telecommunication terminal equipment on the 
reception side (B) is supplemented in the destination 

node (DN), representing the second signalling information, 
provided that this node (DN) is a node of open 

numbering, by the identity number (KDN) designating this 
node (DN) and is not supplemented in the nodes (TN7 ... 

ON) following this node (DN) with respect to the second 
signalling information. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, provided that the origin node (ON) 

and the destination node (DN) are assigned to an area of 
the same identity number and provided that there is at 

least one area of another identity number arranged 
between the two nodes (ON, DN), the first signalling 

information with the call number of the telecommunication 
terminal equipment on the transmission side (A), supplemented 

by the area identity number of the origin node 
(ON), is abbreviated in the destination node (DN), or in 

a node (TN7) preceding the destination node (DN) and 
assigned to the area of the destination node (DN), by th
e 
area identity number of the origin node (ON). 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in  
 

that, after the setup of the telecommunication connection 
from the telecommunication terminal equipment on the 

transmission side (A) to the telecommunication terminal 
equipment on the reception side (B), the second 

signalling information is checked in the nodes (DN, TN7, 
... ON) involved in the setup of the connection on the 

basis of the identity number of the destination node (DN) 
and on the basis of the node number of the origin node 

(ON) to ascertain whether the call number of the 
telecommunication terminal equipment originally on the 

reception side (B) is to be modified, and in that the 
call number of the telecommunication terminal equipment 

on the transmission side (B) is modified in the transmission 
of the second signalling information in such a 

way that the call number of the telecommunication 
terminal equipment on the transmission side (B) is routed 

to the telecommunication terminal equipment on the 
reception side (A) without abbreviations or supplements.
