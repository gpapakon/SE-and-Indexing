<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to copolymers of unsaturated fatty esters. It also relates to the use of these copolymers as viscosity improvers for 
lubricating oils at high temperatures without adversely affecting viscosity at low 
temperatures. Finally, it relates to a composition which is based on the above-mentioned 
copolymers and which is intended to be incorporated into lubricating 
oils, as well as to the lubricating oils comprising said copolymers or said 
composition. The lubricating oils in question within the scope of the present invention 
consist essentially of naphthenic hydrocarbons and paraffinic hydrocarbons and 
their mixtures, the kinematic viscosity of these oils at 100Â°C being between 1 
and 20 and, preferably between 2 and 10 mm2/s. There are already known copolymers of the kind in question which can 
be employed as multipurpose agents and especially as viscosity improvers in 
lubricating oils. It is found, however, that, as oil manufacturers' requirements become 
increasingly constraining, copolymers which are already known no longer meet 
the requirements of practice, especially in their applications in so-called top-grade 
oils or in the case of highly specialized uses. In addition, the multitude of factors that affect the properties of the 
above-mentioned copolymers and the large number of possible combinations of 
these factors mean that the search for copolymers capable of imparting ever 
better properties to lubricating oils, especially in respect of their viscosity, 
becomes increasingly difficult.  
 EP-A-0 225 598 relates to shear-stable multigrade lubricating oils of improved 
VI based on paraffinic base oils including as VI improvers mixtures of at least 
two different polymer species, each of which is built up from (a) esters of 
(meth) acrylic acid or of both with straight-chain unbranched C6-15 alcohols, (b) 
esters of (meth) acrylic acid or of both with straight-chain unbranched C6-30 
alcohols, (c) esters of (meth) acrylic acid or of both with C8-40 branched 
alcohols, (d) esters of (meth) acrylic acid or of both with C1-7 alcohols, and (e) 
monomers copolymerisable by free radicals. EP-A-0 228 922 discloses copolymers useful as lubricant VI improvers 
comprising 10-35 wt% vinylaromatic monomer, 5-15 wt% C1-4 alkyl 
methacrylate, 20-55 wt% C8-14 n-alkyl methacrylate and 15-50 wt% C16-22 n-alkyl 
methacrylate. EP-A-0 439 254 discloses a polymer useful as a lubricant VI improver which 
comprises monomers selected from (a) C1-4 alkyl methacrylates, (b) C10-15 alkyl 
methacryl
