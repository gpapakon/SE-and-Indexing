<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure describes a rust-preventive composition 
comprising a layered phosphate whose active hydrogen is 

reacted with ammonia in an amount of 20 to 80 mol% based on 
the total amount of hydrogen of the layered phosphate, and an 

amphoteric or basic oxide, a ratio by weight of the layered 
phosphate to the amphoteric or basic oxide being 10:1 to 

1:10.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rust-preventive 
composition. More particularly it relates to a rust-preventive 
composition which is free of the pollution 
problem, has excellent rust-preventive property and also 
shows excellent storage stability even when blended in 
aqueous paints which are expected to grow in demand in future 
with strengthened legal regulations on use of VOC (volatile 
organic compounds) and the increasing global interests in the 
environmental problems. Hitherto, as rust-preventives, there have been used 
lead-based pigments such as red lead, lead suboxide, lead 
cyanamide, calcium plumbate, basic lead sulfate and basic 
lead chromate; chrome pigments such as zinc chromate, 
strontium chromate, barium chromate and calcium chromate; 
phosphate pigments such as zinc phosphate, calcium phosphate, 
aluminum phosphate, titanium phosphate, phosphites and 
hypophosphites; molybdate pigments such as zinc molybdate, 
calcium molybdate, and zinc phosphomolybdate; and borate 
pigments such as barium metaborate. In recent years, however, antipollution regulations on 
use of heavy metal elements such as lead and chromium have 
been strengthened, and accordingly demand for pollution-free 
phosphoric acid-based rust-preventives has risen sharply. 
Especially the rust-preventive compositions comprising 
aluminum dihydrogen triphosphate, which is a layered  
 
phosphate, have excellent rust-preventive performance and are 
popularly used as a pollution-free rust-preventive containing 
no heavy metal in various types of paints and coatings such 
as solvent (non-aqueous) type, aqueous and powder type 
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 55-160059 
(1980)). However, the rust-preventives comprising the layered 
phosphate such as aluminum dihydrogen triphosphate have the 
problem that when they are used for an aqueous paint, storage 
stability and/or rust-preventive property of the paint may be 
deteriorated. Therefore, the rust-preventive compositions blended with 
the layered phosphate are required to be modified in 
formulation for improving storage stability of the aqueous 
paints comprising such compositions. With the technical 
trend of solvents from the organic type to the aqueous type 
due to regulations on use of VOC, demand is rising for the 
development of a rust-preventive composition which shows 
excellent storage stability when formulated in an aqueous 
paint.  
 An object of the present invention is to provide a rust-preventive 
composition containing a layered
