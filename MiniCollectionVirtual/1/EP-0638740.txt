<ABSTRACT>
A solenoid 20 for controlling the engagement and 
disengagement of a wrap spring clutch 11 includes an 

electromagnetic coil 22 having a core member 24 
disposed adjacent one axial end thereof. An armature 

26 is provided within the electromagnetic coil 22 for 
selective axial movement in response to the 

energization and deenergization of the electromagnetic 
coil 22. The armature 26 is connected to an actuator 

16 for the wrap spring clutch 11 such that movement of 
the armature 16 controls the engagement and 

disengagement thereof. The core member 24 and the 
armature 26 are both formed from relatively soft, 

magnetically permeable materials. A flux breaker 30 is 
disposed within the electromagnetic coil 22 between one 

axial end of the armature 26 and the core member 24. 
The flux breaker 30 is formed from a relatively hard, 

non-magnetically permeable material, such as stainless 
steel. The flux breaker 30 prevents the armature 26 

from contacting the core member 24 when attracted 
thereto by energization of the electromagnetic coil 22. 

The flux breaker 30 is provided for minimizing the 
adverse effects of residual magnetism on the operation 

of a solenoid 20. By forming the flux breaker 30 from 
a material which is harder than the materials used to 

form the core member 24 and the armature 26, the useful 
life of the flux breaker 30 is extended beyond that of 

prior art flux breakers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to magnetically
actuated clutches and in particular to an improved
structure for a magnetic flux breaker for minimizing the
adverse effects of residual magnetism on the operation of a
solenoid which controls the engagement and disengagement of
a wrap spring clutch.Clutches are well known devices which are frequently
employed in machinery to selectively connect a source of
rotational power to a rotatably driven mechanism.
Typically, a clutch includes an input shaft, an output
shaft, and some mechanism for selectively connecting the
input shaft to the output shaft. When the clutch is
engaged, the input shaft is connected to the output shaft
so as to rotatably drive the driven mechanism. When the
clutch is disengaged, the input shaft is disconnected from
the output shaft.One well known type of clutch is a wrap spring clutch.
A basic wrap spring clutch includes an input hub or shaft,
an output hub or shaft, and a coiled drive spring for
selectively causing the input hub to rotatably drive the
output hub. To accomplish this, the input hub and the
output hub are provided with adjacent, axially aligned
cylindrical surfaces. Portions of the drive spring are
disposed about each of these cylindrical surfaces. The
drive spring has a relaxed inner diameter which is slightly
smaller than the outer diameter of the cylindrical surfaces
of the input and output hubs. Thus, as is well known in
the art, when the input hub is rotated in a first
direction, the drive spring is wrapped tightly about the 
co-axially oriented cylindrical surfaces. As a result, the
output hub is driven to rotate in the first direction with
the input hub. When the input hub is rotated in a second
direction, however, the drive spring is expanded about the
co-axially oriented cylindrical surfaces. As a result, the
output hub is not driven to rotate in the second direction
with the input hub.To control the engagement and disengagement of the
wrap spring clutch efficiently, the drive spring is usually
formed having a control tang at one or both ends thereof.
The control tang is formed integrally with the drive spring
and is provided for facilitating the expansion and
contraction of the drive spring about the cylindrical
surfaces of the input and output hubs. The control tang is
fixed within a hollow cylindrical control collar disposed
about the drive spring for rotation therewith. The
external surface of the control collar is provided with one
or more stops which are selectively engaged by a pivot arm.
