<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of seamless steel pipes of flat products (strip or sheet) for pipes or containers intended for the conveyance, transport or processing of gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons containing CO2 and water and possibly small proportions of H2S, and which are resistant to stress corrosion cracking while at the same time being easily weldable and having a 0.2% yield strength of at least 450 N/mm

. An Ni-containing steel is used which also has the composition below (in wt %): min. 0.015 % C, 0.15-0.50 % Si, max. 2.00 % Mn, max. 0.020 % P, max. 0.003 % S, 12.0-13.8 % Cr, 0.002-0.02 % N, 0.01-0.05 % Nb, the remainder iron and the usual impurities. According to the invention, it is proposed that the Ni content be limited to a maximum of 0.25 %, the Mn content be at least 1.0 %, the C content be limited to 0.035 % and that as additional alloying component, 0.01-1.2 % Mo be included.

Remainder iron and usual impurities. 
A method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the Mo content is limited to a maximum 0.20%. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the Nb content is set to a value between 0.02% and 0.04%.  

 
A method for the production of flat products according to one of Claims 
1 to 3,
 
characterised in that
 
the initial material is heated from 1100 to 1250°C, then is pre-rolled in a first 

rolling phase at temperatures down to a maximum of 1000°C and is then 
finish-rolled in a second rolling phase at temperatures in the range of 850 - 

700°C with a minimum deformation of 30%. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that
 
starting from a finish-rolling temperature of at least 850°C accelerated with a 

cooling rate of at least 5 K/s, cooling takes place to below 200°C. 
A method according to Claim 5,
 
characterised in that
 
after the accelerated cooling, tempering is carried out separately. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that
 
from a finish-rolling temperature of at least 850°C with a cooling rate of 0.5 to 2 

K/s, cooling takes place to ambient temperature. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4 or 7,
 
characterised in that
 
the rolling products are subjected to a separate heat treatment to set the desired 

degree of stability.
