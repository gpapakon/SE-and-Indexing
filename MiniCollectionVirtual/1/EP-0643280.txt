<ABSTRACT>
The electronic system (20) of the probe permits the digital setting of parameters which determine the type of signal processing such as, e.g. trigger thresholds, the characteristics of frequency filters and time intervals between a plurality of related touch signal pulses. Different combinations of parameters are stored together in datasets (data files) which can be called up in accordance with the measurement task to be performed or with the exchanged probe configuration.
