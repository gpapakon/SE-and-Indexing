<ABSTRACT>
Josephson junctions in which the base electrode is of lead-­
alloy tend to deteriorate rapidly when they are subject to cycles 

of temperature change between superconductive tempera­
tures and room temperature. 
In the invention the metal layers which form the base 
electrode (13) are deposited in an inert gas, preferably argon, 

at a pressure of approximately 20m torr. Josephson junctions 
so made are resistant to damage by cyclic temperature 

changes.
