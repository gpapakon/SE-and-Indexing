<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new method and
compositions for improving the absorption of drugs taken
by the oral route by means of encapsulation in millispheres
of gellable hydrocolloids covered with positively
charged polysaccharides.The oral route is preferred when administering drugs
to all kinds of patients due to the advantages of this
method relative to other routes which are more aggressive
and/or more difficult to apply (intravenous, parenteral,
subcutaneous...). Nevertheless, not all drugs are easily
absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract. This absorption
depends, among other factors, on the permeability of the
gastrointestinal mucous membrane to the drug and on the
acidic or enzymatic degratative processes to which the 
drug is subjected whilst it is inside the
gastrointestinal tract. It is therefore clear that any
factor which improves the speed of absorption of the drug
or protects it from the above mentioned degradative
processes will improve the clinical efficiency of that
drug.Recently a considerable amount of effort has been
made to identify agents which are able to increase the
permeability of the gastrointestinal mucous membrane to
poorly absorbed products. Tensioactives (George, Sutter,
Finegold, J. Infec. Dis. 136, 822 (1977), chelating
agents (Cassidy, Tidball, J. Cell. Biol. 32, 672 (1967),
salicylates (Higuchi, et al., U.S. Patent 4,462,991
(1984), anti-inflammatory agents (Yaginuma, et al., Chem.
Pharm. Bull. 29 1974 (1961), phenothiazines (Alexander
and Fix, U.S. Patent 4,425,357 (1984) acyl carnitines
(Alexander and Fix, USSN 606, 054), fatty acids (Yamazaki,
et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 42, 441, (1990) have
been described as able to increase gastrointestinal
permeability to a large variety of compounds. Furthermore,
considerable efforts have also been made to produce
systems which protect drugs from the degradative
gastrointestinal processes. Coverings of farinose (WO
89/11269), Polymers of lactic and glycolic acid (EP
0202159) and Calcium alginate (Chong-Kook K., Eun-Jin L.,
Int. J. Pharm., 79, 11, (1992), have been described as
systems for administering drugs by the gastrointestinal
route.PCT WO 87/03197 describes microspheres which are
less than 200 µm in size and which are obtained from a
drug and a material that has ionic exchange properties,
such as diethylaminoethyl-dextran.PCT WO 88/09163, WO 89/03207, WO 91/02545 and WO
91/06282 describe microspheres which are less than 200 µm
in size and whose centres are made of starch, starch 
derivatives, gelatine,
