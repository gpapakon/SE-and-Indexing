<ABSTRACT>
A gas laser oscillator has at least a partial 
reflection unit (21) and a total reflection unit (24), 

each of which comprises an extension unit for connecting 
between a gas introducing unit and a fixed block unit. 

The gas introducing unit has a gas inlet port (28) for 
circulating laser gas in a laser tube (25), and the 

fixed block unit is provided for fixing a reflector 
(in 21 or 24). A gas inlet port (28) of the gas introducing 

unit is arranged with a predetermined interval 
of 120 mm or more so that the reflectors (in 21 or 24) 

are free from contamination by floating powders and 

deterioration by ultraviolet lays.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas laser
oscillator in which laser gas is circulated in a laser
tube, and from which outputs laser beam excited in a
discharge area in the laser tube.In recent years, gas laser oscillators are
widely used for drilling, cutting, welding or treating a
surface of materials of high hardness, and there is a
great demand particularly in a factory automation field.As one example of the conventional gas laser
oscillator, a conventional gas laser oscillator is shown
in FIG.11. The conventional gas laser oscillator of
FIG.11 is disclosed in the Gazette of the Japanese
unexamined patent application JP-A-1204486.
FIG.11 shows a schematic plan view of the conventional gas
laser oscillator. The conventional gas laser oscillator
comprises a laser tube 6 made of dielectric material such
as glass, a total reflector 1 disposed at one end of the
laser tube 6, return-beam reflectors 2, 3 for folding a
laser beam 7 in the laser tube 6 and a partial reflector 4
disposed at the other end of the laser tube 6. As shown
in FIG.11, the laser beam 7 excited in the laser tube 6 is 
output through the partial reflector 4. The laser gas is
led into the laser tube 6 from gas inlet ports 9, 11, 12
and 14, and exhausted from gas outlet ports 10 and 13. In
FIG.11, the directions of the gas-flow are indicated by
short arrows. A pair of the laser tubes 6, 6 are arranged
in parallel, and connected in series so as to reflect
laser beam 7 between the total reflector 1 and the partial
reflector 4 via return-beam reflectors 2, 3.As mentioned above, the conventional gas laser
oscillator provides the gas inlet ports 9, 11, 12 and 14
adjacent to the total reflector 1, the return-beam
reflectors 2, 3 and the partial reflector 4. And, the
laser gas is led into the laser tube 6 from the gas inlet
ports 9, 11, 12 and 14 by a gas circulation apparatus for
providing a high velocity gas-flow in the laser tube 6.
That is, the total reflector 1, the return-beam reflectors
2, 3 and the partial reflector 4 are disposed in the gas-flow.
The laser gas includes floating powders, oil mists,
dusts or the like brought from mechanical portions etc. of
the gas laser oscillator. Therefore, such floating
powders etc. are apt to stick to mirror portions of the
total reflector 1, the return-beam reflector 2, 3 and the
partial reflector 4. Thereby, these mirror portions are
soiled with the stuck powders etc. more and more as time
passes. As a result, output of the conventional gas laser
oscillator gradually decreases owing to the
