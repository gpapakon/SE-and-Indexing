<ABSTRACT>
A shot cartridge comprises a cartridge-case, a cap, a powder 
charge (1, 3) and a shot charge (5), a wad (4) and a shot 

concentrator. The powder charge (1, 3) is divided by a 
diaphragm (2) with a hole, the diaphragm (2) being placed so 

that the mass of the powder charge part (1) distal from the 
shot charge (5) is higher than the mass of the powder charge 

part (3) close to the shot charge (5). The shot concentrator 
is made as a container (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to shot cartridges, and 
preferably to updating sporting shot-gun cartridges. The most important aim of improving sporting shot-gun cartridges 
is to increase the shot muzzle velocity which makes it 
possible to use steel shots instead of lead ones. Besides the 
economical advantages, ecological problems are also solved; 
this sporting shot-gun ammunition does not contain toxic lead. 
At the same time, increasing the powder charge would mean increased 
gas pressure in the shot-gun barrel which poses a certain 
danger; also the steel shots must be isolated from the 
barrel surface as they move through the barrel. It is an object of the present invention to provide a shot 
cartridge which is better suitable for steel shots, without 
incurring their known disadvanges. This object is settled by the feature given in claim 1. 
Advantageous developments may be taken from the subclaims. According to the invention, he powder charge mass or part not 
adjacent to the shot charge is higher than the mass or part of 
the powder charge adjacent to the shot charge. Both powder 
charge parts are separated from each other with a diaphragm 
with at least one hole. Preferably, the relation between these 
two powder charge part masses is 2 to 1. It is sufficient to 
maintain this relation with an accuracy of ± 0.2 or 20 %. With 
this ratio, the required shot muzzle velocity is achieved such 
that steel shots may be used instead of lead ones. Correspondingly, 
the shot charge may be made from steel. When both a bush forming a shot concentrator and the diaphragm 
aremade from polyethylene, ecological advantages arise.  According to the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the cartridge 
design divides a powder charge into two parts 1 and 3 using a 
polyethylene diaphragm 2 with a small diameter hole, thus 
ensuring a time delay for ignition of the charge's second part 
3. As the first part of the powder charge 1 is ignited, the 
wad 4 and shot set, or shot container 6, and the charge's 
second part 3 are accelerated. During acceleration, the powder 
gases first heat and then ignite the second part of the powder 
charge 3 through the diaphragn hole 2. That is, the impulse 
of the powder charge pressure on the shot charge is increased 
without elevating the maximum breach piece pressure, and 
consequently, the velocity of the shot charge increases. In order to prevent damage to the inner surface of the barrel 
due to the hard steel shot motion, use of a plastic container-concentrator 
is proposed. The
