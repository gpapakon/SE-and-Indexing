<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a switch (1) which is preferably arranged on the steering wheel of a motor vehicle, having a switch lever (10) which projects from a housing (9) arranged to the side of the steering column (3) and which is movably mounted at least in a plane with respect to the steering column (3). This switch lever (10) which can be moved in the plane is connected operatively to switch elements (11) arranged on a printed circuit board (12) in order to actuate them. The switching elements (11) serve in turn to trigger functions such as flasher lamps, windscreen wipers, a windscreen washing system and the like on the vehicle. At least one of the switch elements (11) on the printed circuit board (12) is constructed as an optical light transmitting and/or light receiving element (14, 15; 37, 35a, 35b) which is optically connected to an optical switch (16, 16', 27a, 27b, 36, 55, 55'). The optical switch (16, 16', 27a, 27b, 36, 55, 55') is arranged inside the housing (9) in such a way that the switching process can be effected by the switch lever (10).
