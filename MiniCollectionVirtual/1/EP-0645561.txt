<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control system 
for an automatic transmission. In the prior art, the automatic transmission is 
equipped with a transmission composed of a gear train, 
such that the rotation is transmitted to a predetermined 
gear element of the gear train and is extracted 
from another gear element. For these operations, 
there are arranged a plurality of frictional engagement 
elements such as clutches and brakes, which are 
applied and/or released to transmit the rotation selectively 
between the individual gear elements thereby 
to establish a gear stage corresponding to the combination 
of the gear elements. The frictional engagement elements are individually 
equipped with corresponding hydraulic servos. A 
shift can be effected to a predetermined gear stage,  
 
for example, by newly feeding the oil to the hydraulic 
servo having no oil feed to apply the corresponding 
frictional engagement element and by draining the oil 
from the hydraulic servo having the oil feed to release 
the corresponding frictional engagement element. In case, for example, the vehicle is to be run at 
a 2nd speed in a D-range by the automatic transmission 
having the aforementioned construction, the brake for 
the D-range is applied. In case, however, the vehicle 
is to be run at the 2nd speed while effecting the engine 
brake, the engine braking brake is applied in addition 
to the D-range brake. Specifically, in the case of running the vehicle 
at the 2nd speed in the D-range, a sun gear to be 
rotated backwards is locked, but the torque necessary 
for the application is low. This makes it sufficient 
to apply the D-range brake only. In case, however, 
the vehicle is to be run at the 2nd speed while effecting 
the engine brake, not only the torque for 
locking the sun gear but also a reverse torque for effecting 
the engine brake is applied so that the torque 
necessary increases to an extremely high level. As a 
result, not only the brake for the D-range but also 
the brake for the engine brake is applied. Incidentally, there has been proposed (in Japanese  
 
Patent Publication No. 40576/1992) a control system 
for an automatic transmission, in which a brake 
capacity is changed according to the engine load by 
applying not only the brake for the D-range but also 
the brake for the engine brake, when the engine load 
is high, and by applying the brake for the D-range 
only, when the engine load is low. Thus, the number of friction discs of the D-range 
brake is reduced to make it possible to reduce
