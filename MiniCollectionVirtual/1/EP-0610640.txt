<ABSTRACT>
The reader of bar code labels (12) includes, in a conventional manner, a reading window (11) with a large dimension parallel to the (X) axis, an objective (13) with an optical axis (Y) substantially normal to the window (11) at its centre, which projects a conjugate image of a reading line (12a) of the label (12) onto a CCD type strip (14) so as to form, by sequential scanning, a signal representing the bar code carried by the label. A bank of light-emitting diodes (5) is arranged away from the (X-Y) plane, which will be termed the sighting plane, in order to illuminate the label (12) through the reading window (11). A prismatic optic (16) formed from two refractors (18 and 19) separated by a slot (17) in the sighting plane (X-Y) deviates the beam emitted by the bank (15) so that it is substantially parallel to the sighting plane (X-Y). Thus, the depth of focus of the reader is limited merely by the aperture of the objective (13).

<CLAIMS>
A bar code label reader of the type referred to as the 'manual'
type having an oblong reading window (11) which is presented

substantially parallel to the label (12) with a large dimension (X)
across the bars, the reader comprising a lens (13) with an optical axis

(Y) close to the normal to the window (11) at its centre and capable of
projecting a conjugate image of the label (12) on to a photosensitive

strip (14) comprising a multiplicity of receiver elements involving
sequential electrical scanning, which are aligned in a sighting plane

(X-Y) containing the optical axis (Y) and parallel to the large
dimension of the window and, disposed at a spacing from the sighting

plane, a light source (15) which emits towards the label (12) through
the window a beam which is spread 
out parallel to the large dimension of
the window (11), characterised in that the beam (10) passes through a

prismatic optical member (16) with edges which are parallel to the large
dimension (X) of the window, the optical member being composed of two

refractors (18, 19) disposed on respective sides of a slot (17) where
the sighting plane (X-Y) passes such that the emergent beam (10b, 10c)

emitted by the light source (15) is substantially symmetrical with
respect to the sighting plane (X-Y).
A label reader according to claim 1 characterised in that the
two refractors (18, 19) have cylindrical lens portions (18b, 19b) with

generatrices which are parallel to the prismatic optical member edges
such that the emergent beam (10b, 10c) is substantially parallel to the

sighting plane (X-Y).
A label reader according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised
in that the light source (15) is formed by an array of emitting elements

aligned parallel to the large dimension (X) of the window. 
A label reader according to claim 3 characterised in that the
emitting elements are light-emitting diodes which emit in deep red.
A label reader according to any one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that the photosensitive strip (14) is of the type

referred to as a charge-coupled device or CCD.
