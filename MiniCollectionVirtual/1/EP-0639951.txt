<ABSTRACT>
A calorimeter for generating signals representative of the oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production of a subject over a test period (12) includes two flow sensors (48, 64) and a carbon dioxide scrubber (66) connected to a patient mouthpiece (60). Interconnections (44, 46, 52, 54, 56, 58, 62) are such that the air inhaled by the subject passes through one flow meter and the exhaled breath passes first through the other flow meter, the carbon dioxide scrubber and then through the first flow meter. The electrical output signals from the flow meters are provided to a microprocessor based computer (50) which integrates the volume differences between the inhaled gas, and the exhaled gas after the carbon dioxide has been removed from it, over the period of the test.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to indirect calorimeters
for measuring respiratory oxygen consumption and carbon
dioxide production and more particularly to such a
calorimeter employing bidirectional flow meters for
measurement of the inhaled and exhaled gases and a CO2
scrubber which removes CO2 from the exhaled gas to allow the
computation of the difference between the inhaled gas
volume and the volume of the scrubbed exhaled gas to
calculate oxygen consumption, and the difference between
the exhaled gas volumes before and after scrubbing to
calculate CO2 production.My United States Patent No. 4,917,108, issued
April 17, 1990, discloses an indirect calorimeter, or
oxygen consumption meter, which may be used to measure the
resting energy expenditure of a subject. This measurement
is important for determination of the proper caloric
content for feedings of hospitalized patients and also is
useful in connection with weight loss diets since the basal
energy requirement may vary during the period of the diet.
Similarly, knowledge of caloric expenditure and oxygen
consumption during exercise are useful for cardiac
rehabilitation and athletic training. That patent discloses a calorimeter which
utilizes a unidirectional flow meter operative to generate
electrical signals proportional to the respiratory gases
passing through it, a carbon dioxide scrubber operative to
remove CO2 from the exhaled gas and valving and conduits
connecting the flow meter and the scrubber between a source
of respiratory gases, which may be either the ambient air
or some form of positive pressure ventilator, and a patient
mouthpiece. The inhaled air has a negligible content of
carbon dioxide and the exhaled gas contains lung-contributed
carbon dioxide of essentially the same volume
as the oxygen consumed by the subject. Accordingly, the
difference in volumes between the inhaled and scrubbed
exhaled gases passed through the flow meter provides an
indication of patient's oxygen consumption. By
integrating these differences over a test period, which may
last for several minutes, an accurate measurement of the
subject's oxygen consumption during the trial may be
obtained.My U.S. Patent No. 5,179,958, filed July 8, 1991,
discloses a calorimeter utilizing a bidirectional flow
meter which passes the inhaled gases before they are
scrubbed for CO2 and the exhaled gases after they are
scrubbed, resulting in a simplified design and the
potential for disposability after a single use, eliminating
the requirement for sterilization.One embodiment of that

<CLAIMS>
An indirect calorimeter (12) operative to measure
the respiratory oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide

production per unit time of a subject breathing respiratory
gases comprising:


a respiratory connection (14; 60) operative to
be supported in contact with the subject so as to pass

inhaled and exhaled gases as the subject breathes;
means for connecting to a source of said
respiratory gases;
a first pass-through bidirectional flow meter
(15; 64) adapted to generate electrical signals as a

function of the volume of gases which pass through it in
either direction;
a second flow meter (30; 48) adapted to generate
electrical signals as a function of the gases that pass

through it;
a pass-through carbon dioxide scrubber (18; 66)
operative to absorb carbon dioxide from gases which pass

through it;
conduits (16,20,24,28,32) interconnecting said
respiratory connector, said means for connecting to a

source of respiratory gases, said scrubber and said first
and second flow meters so that upon inhalation by the

patient gases are passed from the source of respiratory
gases, then through the first flow meter, and finally to

the subject through the respiratory connector and upon
exhalation by the subject the exhaled gases are passed 

first through the second flow meter, then through the
scrubber, and finally through the first flow meter in a

direction opposite to the inhaled gases; and
means (38; 50) for receiving the signals from the
first and second flow meters and for generating a first

signal proportional to the integrated differences between
the inhaled and exhaled gas volumes after passage through

the scrubber over a period of time to calculate the oxygen
consumption and a second signal proportional to the

integrated differences between the exhaled gas volumes
before and after being scrubbed to calculate the carbon

dioxide production.

wherein at least one of the flow meters is of the pressure

differential type.
An indirect calorimeter as claimed in claim 1,
wherein at least one of the flow meters is of the

temperature differential type.
An indirect calorimeter as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said conduits are operative to cause the inhaled

gases to be passed through the carbon dioxide scrubber
after passing through the first flow meter and before

passing to the subject through the respiratory connector.
An indirect calorimeter as claimed in claim 1, 
including valve means (58,62) connected to the conduits

operative to pass inhaled gases directly to the subject
through the respiratory connector from the first flow meter

and to pass exhaled gases through the carbon dioxide
scrubber before they pass through the first flow meter.
