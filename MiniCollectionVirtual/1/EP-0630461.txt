<ABSTRACT>
A water tank for heating water preferably in a vending machine for beverages comprises a feed-water inlet (2), a hot water outlet (3), as well as a heating member (4) for heating the water. The water tank (1) is divided into a heating section (21) including the hot water outlet (3) and the heating member (4), as well as a lime-precipitating section (22) including the feed-water inlet (2), said tank being divided by means of a partition (6). This partition (6) extends from one side (7) of the water tank immediately adjacent the surface of the water at maximum water level (10) and obliquely downwards towards the opposite side (12) of said water tank. Then the partition extends at a distance from the tank wall (12) downwards to the immediate vicinity of the bottom (14) of said water tank, whereby the heating section (21) is placed below the oblique portion (11) of the partition (6). An upper flow passage (18, 19) for water is provided between the heating section (21) and the lime-precipitating section (22) at the upper end of the oblique portion (11) of the partition (6), and a lower flow passage (28) for water is provided between the lime-precipitating section (22) and the heating section (21) at the lower rim of the partition (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a water tank for heating water preferably in a 
vending machine for beverages, said tank comprising a feed-water inlet, 
a hot water outlet, as well as a heating member for heating the water. The hot water tank in vending machines for beverages was previously 
made of metal or metal parts with the effect that the lime in the water 
deposited as flakes on the metal surfaces, whereby a decalcification for 
2 to 3 hours was necessary 2 to 5 times annually. A manufacture of hot 
water tanks of plastics eliminates the frequent decalcification, but is 
instead encumbered with the problem of lime particles floating in the 
water and following said water when the hot water leaves the hot water 
tank, said plastics for instance being polypropylene which is particularly 
resistant to lime deposits on the surfaces. The lime particles are formed 
by lime crystals, which in turn result from the process 
Ca++ + 2HCO3- ⇄ CaCO3 + CO2 + H2OThe lime crystals deposit as small particles in the water instead of on the 
inner side of the water tank. These small particles act as germs to larger 
lime crystals, which at first float in the water, and later on settle. The 
CaCO3-crystals are of a larger density than water and do not settle 
immediately because the resulting CO2 deposits on the crystals and 
thereby keeps said crystals floating until they have reached a predetermined 
size. When the water tank is used, a considerable amount of lime crystals is  
 
constantly floating in the water. These crystals can both act on the 
delivery functions inter alia by settling in the closing mechanisms of the 
valves, and cause inconvenience to the customer as the water delivered, 
such as a beverage, will contain visible lime crystals. The object of the present invention is to provide a water tank ensuring 
such a precipitation of lime that the delivered hot water is substantially 
free of lime particles. The water tank according to the invention is characterised in that the 
water tank is divided into a heating section including the hot water 
outlet and the heating member, as well as a lime-precipitating section 
including the feed-water inlet, said tank being divided by means of a 
partition extending from one side of the water tank immediately adjacent 
the surface of the water at maximum water level and obliquely downwards 
towards the opposite side of said water tank and then further at 
a distance from the tank wall downwards to the immediate vicinity of 
the bottom of said water tank, whereby the

beverages, said tank comprising a feed-water inle (2), a hot water outlet (3), 

as well as a heating member (4) for heating the water, 
characterised
 
in that the water tank (1) is divided into a heating section (21) 

including the hot water outlet (3) and the heating member (4), as well as 
a lime-precipitating section (22) including the feed-water inlet (2), said 

tank being divided by means of a partition (6) extending from one side

maximum water level (10) and obliquely downwards towards the opposite 
side (12) of said water tank and then further at a distance from the 

tank wall (12) downwards to the immediate vicinity of the bottom (14)

oblique portion (11) of the partition (6), that an upper flow passage (18, 
19) for water is provided between the heating section (21) and the lime-precipitating 

section (22) at the upper end of the oblique portion (11) of 
the partition (6), and that a lower flow passage (28) for water is provided 

between the lime-precipitating section (22) and the heating section 
(21) at the lower rim of the partition (6). 
A water tank as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised
 in that 
the lower rim of the upper flow passage is placed a short distance below 

the water surface at maximum water level (10), but at the lowest level 
of the water surface immediately after initiation of the feeding of water. 
A water tank as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
 in 
that the upper flow passage (18, 19) is formed by at least two mutually 

spaced recesses (18, 19) provided in the partition (6). 
A water tank as claimed in claim 1, 2, or 3, 
characterised
 
in that the lower flow passage (28) is defined by a partition portion (15)
