<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymeric multilayer films having one 
or more fillers, and more particularly, to such multilayer films 
having high concentrations of fillers to increase the opacity of the 
film. It has long been known in the disposable absorbent bandage art 
that it is extremely desirable to construct absorptive devices, such 
as sanitary napkins, disposable diapers, incontinent articles, and 
the like, presenting a dry surface feel to the user to improve 
wearing comfort and to minimize the development of undesirable skin 
conditions due to prolonged exposure to moisture absorbed within the 
bandage. One viable prior art solution to the aforementioned problem is 
disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 4,342,314 issued to 
Radel et al. on August 3, 1982. 
Radel et al. discloses an absorbent bandage with a 
wearer-contacting topsheet comprising a resilient macroscopically 
expanded, three-dimensional plastic web exhibiting a combination of 
fiber-like and plastic properties. In a preferred embodiment, the 
macroscopically expanded three-dimensional plastic web topsheet 
disclosed in Radel et al. exhibits a fine scale three-dimensional 
microstructure comprising a regulated continuum of capillary 
networks, of steadily decreasing size, originating in and extending 
from one surface of the web and terminating in the form of apertures 
in the opposite surface thereof to promote rapid fluid transport in 
the direction of decreasing capillary size. The web's fiber-like 
appearance is comprised of a continuum of fiber-like elements, the 
opposed ends of each of the fiber-like elements being interconnected 
to at least one other of the fiber-like elements.  
 To reduce the gloss of the plastic web's visible surface, i.e., 
that portion of the web which is visible from directly overhead, it 
has been learned that inclusion of a microscopic pattern of surface 
aberrations which are not discernible when the perpendicular 
distance between the viewer's eye and the plane of the web is about 
12 inches is highly effective. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 
4,463,045 issued to Ahr et al. on July 31, 1984 
defines the relevant criteria which 
must be satisfied so that the three-dimensional expanded web will 
exhibit a substantially non-glossy visible surface. A topsheet of the type generally disclosed by Radel et al., 
having surface aberrations according to Ahr et al., exhibits a 
fiber-like appearance and tactile impression as well as a non-glossy 
visible surface. In addition, it is highly effective

<CLAIMS>
A substantially polymeric multilayer film (120) which exhibits 
an opaque appearance, said polymeric multilayer film (120) comprising 


(a) a first outer layer (122) comprised substantially of a polymer; 
(b) a central filler containing polymeric layer (124) having a first 
side and a second side opposed thereto, said first side being 

substantially continuously joined to one side of said first 
outer layer (122), said filler containing polymeric layer (124) having 20 

to 60 weight percent fillers relative to said filler containing 
layer (124) and being substantially uniformly dispersed therein, 
(c) a second outer layer (122) comprised substantially of a polymer 
and having one side substantially continuously joined to said 

second side of said central filler containing layer (124), characterized in 
that said 

multilayer film (120) has at least 15 weight percent fillers 
relative to said total multilayer film such that said fillers 

in said central filler containing layer (124) scatter light rays 

incident upon said multilayer film to produce said opaque 
appearance in said multilayer film (120), and in that said filler containing layer (124) has 

a thickness from 25 to 80 percent of the total thickness of said multilayer film (120) . 
A multilayer film (120) according to Claim 1, wherein said filler 
containing layer (124) comprises fillers selected from the group 

consisting of titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, silica, colored 
pigments, filaments and combinations thereof. 
A multilayer film (120) according to Claim 2, wherein said 
fillers impart opacity to said multilayer film. 
A multilayer film (120) according to Claim 1, wherein said filler 
containing layer (124) comprises polymers selected from the group 

consisting of polyolefins, copolymers having at least one olefinic  
 

constituent, polyesters, nylons, copolymers of polyesters and 
nylons, and combinations thereof. 
A multilayer film (120) according to Claim 4, wherein said filler 
containing layer (124) comprises polymers selected from the group 

consisting of polyethylenes, polypropylenes, ethylene vinyl acetate 
copolymer and combinations thereof. 
A multilayer film (120) according to Claim 1, wherein said outer 
layers (122) comprise polymers selected from the group consisting of 

polyolefins, copolymers having at least one olefinic constituent, 
polyesters, nylons, copolymers of polyesters and nylons and 

combinations thereof. 
A multilayer film (120) according to Claim 6, wherein said outer 
layers (122) comprise polymers selected from the group consisting of 

polyethylenes, polypropylenes and combinations thereof. 
A multilayer film (120) according to Claim 6, further comprising 
from about 1 to about 15 weight percent fillers dispersed in said 

outer layers (122). 
A substantially polymeric multilayer film (120) according to claim 1 having a 
multiplicity of apertures therein  

 
extending from a first surface and a second 

surface, said first and second surfaces having a multiplicity of 
apertures therein. 
An absorbent bandage including a substantially polymeric 
multilayer formed-film topsheet having a multiplicity of apertures 

therein and an absorbent element for absorbing bodily fluids, said 
polymeric multilayer formed-film topsheet 

comprising a multilayer film (120) 
according to any of the preceding claims.
