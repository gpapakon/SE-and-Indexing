 ASSAY FOR DETECTION OF HIV ANTIGEN AND HIV ANTIBODYThis application is a continuation- in-part of U.S.S.N. 787,710 filed November 4, 1991 , which is a continuation application of U.S.S.N-. 07/361 ,733 filed June 2, 1989 (abandoned), which is a continuation-in-part application of U.S.S.N. 07/320,882 filed March 9, 1989 (abandoned), which is a continuation application of U.S.S.N. 07/020,282 filed February 27, 1987 (abandoned) which is a continuation-in-part application of U.S.S.N. 06/811 ,240 filed December 20, 1985 (abandoned), which enjoy common ownership and are incorporated herein in reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to immunoassays, and more particularly, relates to an immunoassay and products for the simultaneous detection of HIV-1 antigen analyte and HIV-1 antibody analyte and/or HIV-2 antibody analyte in a test sample.Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disorder of the immune system associated with opportunistic infections and/or neoplasms which has reached epidemic proportions in the United States as well as in Europe and in central Africa. The epidemiological data suggest that AIDS is caused by at least two types of human immunodeficiency viruses, collectively designated as HIV. HIV type 1 (HIV-1) has been isolated from patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC), and from healthy persons at high risk for AIDS. See, for example, F. Barre-Sinoussi et al., Science 220:868-871 91983); M. Popovic et al., Science 224:497-500 (1984); and R. C. Gallo et al., Science 224:500- 503 (1984). HIV-1 is transmitted by sexual contact, exposure to blood and certain blood products, or from an infected mother to her fetus or child. P. Piot et al., Science 239:573-579 (1988). The prevalence of HIV-1 antibodies inAIDS and ARC patients and persons at risk is high, and the virus can be isolated from nearly 90% of ail seropositive individuals. See, for example, M. G. Sarngadharan et al., Science 224:506-508 (1984); and D. Gallo et al., J. Clin. Micro. 25:1291-1294 (1987). In 1986, a second human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-2, was isolated from patients with AIDS in west Africa. F. Clavel et al., Science 233:343-346 (1986). HIV-2 infections also have been identified in individuals from several 

countries outside of west Africa. See, for example, A. G. Saimot et al., Lancet i:688 (1987); M.A. Rey et al., Lancet i:388-389 (1986); A. Werner et al., Lancet i:868-869 (1987); G. Brucker et al., AIDS 2:141 (1988); and K. Marquart et al., AIDS 2:141 (1988). Although at the
