<ABSTRACT>
An encapsulated catamenial tampon (10) is disclosed which can 
easily and comfortably be inserted into a woman's vagina. 

The tampon (10) includes an absorbent (12) having a 
withdrawal string (14) attached thereto. The absorbent (12) 

is retained in a dissolvable capsule (20) having a 
cylindrically shaped base member (22) and a semi-spherically 

shaped cap member (24). The base member (22) houses at least 
a portion of the absorbent (12) and contains a first end (26) 

and a second end (28). The first end (26) is completely open 
while the second end (28) has an opening (36) formed therein 

through which the withdrawal string (14) passes. The cap 
member (24) slightly overlaps the first end (26) of the base 

member (22) to enclose the absorbent (12). Both the base and 
cap members (22,24) have a plurality of openings (36,38) 

formed therethrough which decrease the surface area of the 
capsule (20) to allow the capsule to dissolve quickly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catamenial tampon. There are two basic types of tampons used for feminine 
hygiene. The first type is a digital tampon which is 
designed to be inserted directly by the user's fingers. The 
second type is a tampon with an applicator. The applicator 
can be either a stick or tube which is removably attached to 
an end of the tampon or a hollow telescoping device which 
surrounds the tampon. The applicator provides a comfortable 
method for positioning the tampon into the vagina. Both types of tampons usually require that the insertion end 
of the tampon be round or semi-spherical in shape so as to 
facilitate the insertion process. A tampon having a flat end 
or a concave shape, such as the base end of a cone, can cause 
a great amount of discomfort while being inserted. One way 
to avoid this discomfort is to encapsulate the tampon in a 
dissolvable capsule. U.S. patents 639,864; 749,220; 
1,575,123; 1,582,201 and 2,267,030 teach various forms of 
medical tampons housed in some sort of capsule. However, 
none of these patents address the issue of shorting the time 
period which it takes the capsule to dissolve within the 
vagina. Another way to ease the insertion of the tampon into 
the vagina is to coat the forward end of the tampon. This 
has been taught in U.S. patents 2,340,311 and 2,440,141. Presently, most tampons utilize a single cylindrically shaped 
pledget with a round convex tip. These tampons have a 
predetermined amount of absorbent capacity. It has found 
that by constructing a tampon out of a plurality of 
individual, compressed absorbent cones, the absorption 
capacity of a tampon can be significantly increased. The use 
of one or more absorbent cones has been taught in the 
following U.S. patents: 2,330,257; 2,499,414; 3,572,341;  
 
3,618,605; 3,794,024; 3,834,389; 3,794,029 and 4,335,720. A 
patent which teaches the use of multiple flat absorbent 
elements is found in U.S. patents 3,965,905. Likewise, U.S. 
patent 3,841,333, although not teaching a tampon, does teach 
a menses collector having several superposed rows of 
collecting cups. The invention provides an encapsulated catamenial tampon 
according to any one of independent claims 1 or 2. Further 
advantageous features, aspects and details of the invention 
are evident from the dependent claims, the description and 
the drawings. The claims are intended to be understood as a 
first non-limiting approach of defining the invention in 
general terms. The invention provides an encapsulated catamenial
