<ABSTRACT>
The cartridge (10) (preferably of the thermal inkjet 
type) includes a housing (12) having a multi-cellular foam 

member (100) therein. To increase the ink-retaining capacity of 
the foam member, one or more elongate bores (130) are positioned 

entirely through the foam member (100). Each bore is preferably 
uniform in cross-sectional size and configuration along 

its entire length, and may encompass numerous cross-sectional 
configurations (e.g. circular or rectangular). 

The longitudinal axis of each bore is preferably 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the foam member. 

When the foam member (100) is supplied with ink, an additional 
portion of ink is retained within each bore. As a result, 

the ink-retaining capacity of the foam member is increased 
compared with foam members which lack any bores. The 

bores function as internal ink reservoirs from which ink 
may be drawn during cartridge operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to ink
delivery systems, and more particularly to an ink
cartridge for thermal ink jet printers and other printing
systems having a substantially improved ink-retaining
capacity.Substantial developments have been made in the field
of electronic printing technology. Specifically, a wide
variety of highly efficient printing systems currently
exist which are capable of dispensing ink in a rapid and
accurate manner. Thermal inkjet systems are especially
important in this regard. Printing systems using thermal
inkjet technology basically involve a cartridge which
includes at least one ink reservoir chamber in fluid
communication with a substrate having a plurality of
resistors thereon. Selective activation of the resistors
causes thermal excitation of the ink and expulsion thereof
from the ink cartridge. Representative thermal inkjet
systems are discussed in U.S. Patent No. 4,500,895 to Buck
et al.; No. 4,794,409 to Cowger et al.; No. 4,509,062 to
Low et al.; No. 4,929,969 to Morris; No. 4,771,295 to
Baker et al., and the Hewlett-Packard Journal, Vol. 39,
No. 4 (August 1988). In order to retain suitable volumes of ink within a
thermal inkjet cartridge (or any other ink cartridge), a
multi-cellular absorbent member is typically used which
retains ink therein. This ink may then be withdrawn on
demand. For example, as stated in U.S. Patent No.
4,771,295 to Baker et al., a conventional ether-type foam
material (e.g. obtainable from the Scott Paper Company of
Philadelphia, PA (USA)) may be used for this purpose.
U.S. Patent No. 4,794,409 to Cowger et al. discloses a
thermal inkjet cartridge having a foam block therein
manufactured from reticulated cellulose. Other absorbent
materials used in ink cartridge systems include but are
not limited to foam rubber (U.S. Patent No. 3,967,286 to
Anderson et al.), and polyethylene and/or polyurethane
foam (U.S. Patent No. 4,306,245 to Kasugayama et al.)However, numerous attempts have been made to
increase the volumetric ink-retaining capacity of ink
cartridges (e.g. thermal inkjet systems). Increased ink-retaining
capacity results in improved printing
efficiency, reduced printer down-time, and greater
consumer economy. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,929,969
to Morris discloses a thermal inkjet cartridge which uses
an absorbent member constructed from open cell melamine-formaldehyde
condensate foam. The patent states that this
material imparts improved volumetric capacity to the
cartridge. U.S. Patent No. 4,749,291 to Kobayashi et al.
