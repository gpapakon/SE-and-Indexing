<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pyridopyridazinones and pyridazinthiones
useful as anti-inflammatory agents, antasthmatic agents,
immunosuppressive agents, anti-allograft rejection agents, anti-graft-vs-host
disease agents, anti-autoimmune agents or analgetic
agents, to their intermediates, to their preparation and to
pharmaceutical compositions using the compounds of the invention.Cyclic 3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) modulates a variety
of cellular and physiologic functions in mammals, such as, cell
division, endocrine function, and the immune response. The level of
CAMP is controlled, in part, by a class of enzymes called phospho-diesterases,
which enzymatically degrade cAMP. There are five families
of phosphodiesterase that are categorized according to their function.
For instance, phosphodiesterase III (PDE III) is isolated from human
platelet cells and modulates platelet aggregation. Another type of
phosphodiesterase, (PDE IV), is found in various cells but it is the
predominant form in human leukocytes. This enzyme modulates leukocyte
activation and function associated with the immune response and
inflammation. Both of these phospho-diesterases implement their control
by modulating the cellular level of cAMP in their respective cells.
Thus, inhibition of phosphodiesterases provides a method of modulating
any cellular and bodily function that is controlled by cAMP.Compounds that are nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitors are
known, i.e., these compounds inhibit all or multiple types of
phosphodiesterases. [See, Beavo, J.A. and D.H. Reifsyder, Trends in
Pharm. Science, 11:150-155 (1990); and Nicholson, C.D., R.A.J. Challiss
and M. Shahid, Trends in Pharm. Science, 12:19-27 (1991).]Nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitors are of limited value
because of numerous side-effects. Since cAMP is involved in so many
functions throughout the body, a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor
has the potential to alter all of the functions modulated by cAMP. Csampai et al. [Tetrahedron 45:5539-5548 (1989)], Ismail et al.
[Tetrahedron 40:2983-2984 (1984)], Johnson et al. [J. Org. Chem. 56:5218-5221
(1991)], Jakolev et al. [Zh. Org. Khim. 24:2433-2436 (1988)] and
Wermuth et al. [Chimie Therapeutique 6:109-115 (1971)] describe the
preparation of phthalazinones and arylphthalazones as intermediates and
synthons. Additional phthalazones have been described by Fahmy et al.
