<ABSTRACT>
In the invention we provide an electricity supply 
unit (3) having separate primary (1) and secondary (2) 

chambers, in which the primary chamber (1) is sealed 
and connected to the mains and the secondary 

chamber (2) is accessible to the user for electrical 
connections and has a common earth within the primary 

chamber. This enables the electricity supply company to 
fit the unit and seal the primary chamber (1) and 

another party to make connections to the secondary 
chamber (2) without disturbing the primary chamber (1). 
To be accompanied when published by Figure la of 
the drawings.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in and 
relating to switches, and especially, but not 
exclusively, to switches associated with cut-out units 
for street furniture such as lamp post, signs and the 
like. There are many known switches. The field of cut-out units for street furniture 
conventionally uses a separate, add-on, switch to be 
used in series with a separate cut-out unit. An aim of the present invention is to provide a 
new arrangement for street furniture cut-outs, and 
switches for them. According to a first aspect of the invention, we 
provide a switch having a first member and a second 
member movable between a closed condition in which the 
switch is closed and an open condition in which the 
switch is open, one of the members incorporating a 
cut-out unit for street furniture. Alternatively we may provide street furniture 
incorporating such a switch or cut-out unit. According to a second aspect of the invention we 
provide an electricity supply unit comprising a housing 
defining a primary chamber adapted to receive an 
electrical cable so as to provide a primary supply of 
electricity to the primary chamber, and a separate 
secondary chamber; in which the primary chamber is 
sealed closed to prevent, or indicate, unauthorised 
entry to the primary chamber, but in which the  
 
secondary chamber is accessible to the user for 
electrical connections and has a common earth with the 
primary chamber. This enables the electricity supply company to fit 
the unit and seal the primary chamber and another 
party, possibly a local council, to make connections to 
the secondary chamber without disturbing the primary 
chamber. This can be useful for original installation 
of street furniture, and also for subsequent 
modification. For example, if the council decides to 
alter their requirements they can adjust the 
connections in the secondary chamber and not incur the 
cost of having the Electricity Board alter the primary 
connections. The secondary chamber may also have a live and/or 
neutral connection, preferably formed by members 
extending from the primary chamber. The secondary 
chamber may provide a controlled, fused, supply of 
electricity. The primary and secondary chambers may be divided 
by a common dividing wall or plate. Sealing means may 
be provided preventing the removal of the dividing 
plate. The secondary chamber may be on top of the primary 
chamber. The housing may comprise a primary chamber member 
and secondary chamber member which is removable from 
the primary

<CLAIMS>
A street furniture electricity supply unit 
comprising a housing, said housing defining a primary 

chamber (74) adapted to receive an electrical cable so 
as to provide a primary supply (84) of electricity to 

said primary chamber (74), and a separate secondary 
chamber, said primary chamber (75) being sealed closed 

to prevent, or indicate, unauthorised entry to said 
primary chamber, but in which said secondary chamber is 

accessible to a user for electrical connections; said 
housing further comprising an earth (83; 100) common to 

said primary chamber (74) and said secondary 
chamber (75). 
A street furniture electricity supply unit (1) 
comprising a housing, said housing defining a primary 

chamber (74) adapted to receive an electrical cable so 
as to provide a primary supply (89) of electricity to 

said primary chamber, and a separate secondary 
chamber (75), said primary chamber being sealed closed 

to prevent, or indicate, unauthorised entry to said 
primary chamber, but in which said secondary chamber is 

accessible to a user for electrical connections; said 
housing further comprising an earth (83, 100) common to 

said primary chamber (74) and said secondary 
chamber (75). 
A street furniture electricity supply unit 
according to claim 2, in which said housing is 

additionally provided with a dividing wall to separate 
said primary and secondary chambers. 
A street furniture electricity supply unit 
according to claim 2 or Claim 3, in which said 

 
secondary chamber (75) is removable from said primary 

chamber (74). 
A street furniture cut-out assembly (3) having a 
cut-out unit (2) and an electricity supply unit (1), 

the electricity supply unit being in accordance with 
any preceding claim. 
A street furniture cut-out assembly according to 
claim 5 in which the cut out unit (2) has a cover 

member (13) which is movable between an open and a 
closed condition, movement of the cover member (13), to 

the open condition causing the cut-out unit (2) to be 
isolated from the supply (89) of electricity. 
A street furniture cut-out assembly according to 
Claim 6, in which the cover member (13), or a housing 

with which the cover member (13) co-operates, has a 
test port to enable diagnostic tests to be performed on 

said cut-out unit with the cover member in place; or 
the cover member or housing having built-in diagnostic 

test means. 
An electrically powered item of street furniture, 
such as a lampost, bollard, illuminated sign, traffic 

light, or the like having an electricity supply 
unit (1) in accordance with claim 1, a street furniture 

electricity supply unit (1) in accordance with any one 
of claims 2 to 4, or a street furniture cut-out 

assembly (3) in accordance with any one of Claims 5 
to 7. 
A method of wiring an item of street furniture 
into a mains supply of electricity comprising the steps 

of connecting said mains supply to a primary 
chamber (74) of a power supply unit (1), sealing said 

 
primary chamber (74), and connecting a cut-out unit (2)
