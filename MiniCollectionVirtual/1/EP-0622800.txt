<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
semiconductor memory devices, and more particularly to
control performed at the time of writing data into and
reading data from a semiconductor memory device such as
a DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) or an SRAM
(Static Random Access Memory).Recently, a semiconductor memory device has
employed a relatively large chip and the data lines for
transferring data read from memory cells to output
circuits have become longer. Further, in order to
increase the access speed, a complex read operation has
been employed. Examples of such a complex read
operation are a page mode and static column mode in the
DRAM. In such a complex read operation, a case will
frequently occur in which second data is read via a
pair of data lines in a state in which first data
remains in the pair of data lines.If the first read data and the subsequent
second read data have opposite polarities of the pair
of data lines, it takes a long time to inverse the
polarities of the pair of data lines due to a parasitic
capacitance coupled to the long data lines.In order to avoid the above problem,
conventionally, the pair of data lines is set to
constant potentials at the time of reading data from a
memory cell. The constant potentials limit the
amplitude voltage between the pair of data lines and
contribute to reduction the time it takes to inverse
the polarities of the pair of data lines.Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of an essential
part of a conventional semiconductor memory device. 
Referring to Fig. 1, m (m is an integer equal to or
larger than 1) bistable flip-flop circuits 1 are
coupled to a pair 3 of data lines D and /D via m
selection transistor circuits 2. It will be noted that
"/D" denotes an inverted version of a signal "D" or a
signal line carrying the inverted signal /D. The
symbol "/" corresponds to "bar" shown in the drawings.
The above holds true for the combination of other
characters with the symbol "/". A load circuit 4, a
read buffer circuit 5 and a write buffer circuit 6 are
connected to the pair 3 of data lines of a
complementary type.Each of the flip-flop circuits 1 includes two
N-channel MOS transistors (FETs) Q1 and Q2 and two P-channel
MOS transistors Q3 and Q4, and stores write
data or read data with complementary signals. Power
supply voltages VCC and VSS (VCC > VSS) are supplied to
each of the flip-flop circuits 1. For example, the
power supply voltages VCC and VSS are 5V and 0V,
respectively. Each of the selection transistor
circuits 2 includes two N-channel MOS
