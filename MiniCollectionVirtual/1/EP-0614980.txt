Transdominant variant of the HIV virus TAT
protein or of a functional fragment of said protein

which is capable of inducing transactivation of the
expression of one or more genes placed under the control

of a promoter containing the TAR sequence, 
characterized
in that
 the said variant comprises a mutation selected
from the mutations consisting in the presence, in

position 38, of a residue having an acid side chain such
as a glutamic acid or an aspartic acid.
Variant according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said variant is derived from the HIV1 TAT protein.
Variant according to Claims 1 and 2, comprising
aspartic acid in position 38.
DNA fragment encoding a TAT protein variant
according to one of Claims 1 to 3.
Expression cassette comprising a DNA fragment
according to Claim 4, placed under the control of

appropriate elements permitting its expression.
Eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell comprising an
expression cassette according to Claim 5.
Process for the preparation of a variant
according to one of Claims 1 to 3, according to which:


a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell according to Claim
6 is cultured in an appropriate culture medium, and
the variant produced is harvested from the culture
medium or from said cell.
TAT protein variant obtained using a process
according to Claim 7. 
Variant according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
expression cassette according to Claim 5, or cell

according to Claim 6, to be used as medicinal product.
Pharmaceutical composition intended for the
treatment or prevention of a HIV infection which

comprises as therapeutic or prophylactic agent a variant
according to one of Claims 1 to 3, an expression

cassette according to Claim 5 or a cell according to
Claim 6.
Use of a variant according to one of Claims 1 to
3, of an expression cassette according to Claim 5 or of

a cell according to Claim 6, for obtaining a medicinal
product intended to inhibit the replication of the HIV

virus.
