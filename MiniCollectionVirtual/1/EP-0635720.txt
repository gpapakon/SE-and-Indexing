<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining a platelet function in a primary 
hemostasis as provided in which a blood sample or a platelet containing 

fraction thereof is introduced into a vessel having a flat bottom which has 
an inner surface covered with a substrate capable of inducing platelet 

adhesion thereto and aggregation such as ECM (extracellular matrix). 
Preparation is then rotated inside the vessel, and consequently shear forces 

develop on the surface which bring to adhesion an aggregation of the blood 
platelets to the surface. Morphological parameters of blood aggregates are 

then determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method and an apparatus for
determining platelet function in primary hemostasis.Hemostasis, i.e. the arrest of hemorrhage, is a mechanism which
comprises essentially two consecutively functioning mechanisms: "primary
hemostasis" is responsible for the immediate arrest of hemorrhage and is
caused by the localization and aggregation of circulating platelets on
damaged vascular surfaces or exposed tissues and subsequent formation of
a thrombus; "secondary hemostasis" is responsible for the long-term arrest
of hemorrhage and is caused by a chain of enzymatic reactions resulting
eventually in the formation of fibrin.Abnormalities of primary hemostasis are clinical conditions
associated with bleeding tendencies which can become life-threatening in
traumatic situations such as operation, delivery, invasive diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures as well as traumatic injury. The evaluation of the
degree of primary hemostasis is thus of a high clinical importance.Several procedures have been hitherto employed in order to
evaluate primary hemostasis. One procedure termed "the bleeding time
test", which is the most common clinical test for determining primary
hemostasis, is carried out by inducing a controlled cut in the arm of the
tested subject and determining the duration before bleeding is arrested. This
procedure has relatively low clinical relevance as it is able to identify only
severe abnormalities in primary hemostasis and is thus unable to distinguish
between normal subjects and those whose primary hemostasis is slightly
defective. Furthermore, this method is virtually impossible to standardize
since the duration of bleeding depends strongly on the precise size and
location of the cut as well as on the venus and arterial blood pressures.Platelet aggregation studies are usually performed in platelet-rich
plasma (PRP) using a turbidometric device according to Born (Born G.V.R.,
Nature, 194, 927-929 (1962)). One drawback of turbidometric
aggregometry is that the use of PRP necessitates centrifugation and
separation of platelets from other blood cells which manipulation may alter
platelets' properties and behavior. Another drawback of the turbidometric
method is in that it is time consuming and laborious. Finally, the evaluation
of such a test is limited by the optical quality of PRP which is affected by
the levels of lipids in the plasma.Platelets' aggregation was also tested in whole blood (WB) (Riess
H., Am. J. Clin. Pathol, 85, 50-56, (1986)). According to this technique,

A method for determining platelet function in primary hemostasis
comprising:


(a) obtaining a sample being whole - blood or a platelet-containing
fraction thereof; and optionally mixing it with an anti-coagulant in an

amount sufficient to inhibit blood coagulation;
(b) introducing the sample obtained in (a) into a vessel having a flat
bottom the inner surface of which is covered with a substrate capable

of inducing platelet adhesion thereto and aggregation;
(c) rotating said preparation inside the vessel, whereby shear forces, in the

component thereof capable of inducing platelet adhesion thereto and

aggregation.
A method according to Claim 2, wherein the active component of ECM
is selected from basement membrane matrix, fibrilar and

non-fibrilar collagen of various types, von Willebrand factor and fibronectin.
