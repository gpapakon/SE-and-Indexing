<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pressure control device (K1) is described 
comprising: an inlet valve (8) which is provided in a supply 

path (3) for connecting a fluid pressure apparatus (50) and a 
fluid pressure source (1) and is opened so as to increase 

fluid pressure of the fluid pressure apparatus (50); and an 
outlet valve (9) which is provided in a discharge path (7) 

for discharging working fluid from the fluid pressure 
apparatus (50) and is opened so as to reduce the fluid 

pressure of the fluid pressure apparatus (50). The inlet 
valve (8) is formed by a solenoid selector valve effecting 

only a fully open operation and a fully closed operation, and 
the outlet valve (9) is formed by a flow control valve in 

which one-to-one correspondence exists between quantity of 
drive current applied thereto and flow rate of the working 

fluid flowing therethrough.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
fluid pressure control device for adjusting fluid pressure 
in fluid pressure apparatuses mounted on a motor vehicle, 
for example, a steering apparatus, a suspension apparatus 
and a brake apparatus and more particularly, to a brake 
fluid pressure control device such as a brake fluid pressure 
control device for traction control, in which control 
performance is improved by employing a flow control valve 
without incurring rise of production cost of the brake 
fluid pressure control device. Conventionally, various flow control valves 
suitable for a brake fluid pressure control device have 
been developed. For example, the present applicant proposed 
a flow control valve of this kind in Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Publication Nos. 3-223578 (1991) and 3-234987 
(1991). In this known flow control valve, for example, a 
spool including an orifice accommodated slidably in a 
sleeve is urged by an electromagnet. Pressure difference 
between opposite sides of the orifice, which are communicated 
with an input port and an output port, respectively, 
is determined by urging force of this electromagnet and 
specifies flow rate at the orifice. Therefore, in this 
known flow control valve, when quantity of electric current 
supplied to the electromagnet is determined, flow rate of 
working fluid flowing from the inlet 1  
 
port to the outlet port is determined. In other words, 
one-to-one correspondence exists between quantity of 
electric current supplied to the electromagnet and flow 
rate of working fluid. As compared with a so-called "ON/OFF" type solenoid 
selector valve in which only a fully open operation 
and a fully closed operation are performed, this known flow 
control valve is advantageous in that since flow rate of 
working fluid can be controlled continuously by adjusting 
quantity of electric current supplied to the electromagnet, 
control performance can be improved and that operational 
noises are suppressed. Meanwhile, U.S. Patent No. 5,261,731 discloses a 
valve in which pressure difference between an inlet port 
and an outlet port can be adjusted continuously. This 
prior art valve includes a valve body establishing and 
cutting off communication between the inlet port and the 
outlet port and an electromagnet for urging the valve body. 
Thus, in this prior art valve, by establishing and cutting 
off communication between the inlet port and the outlet 
port through change of urging force of the electromagnet, 
pressure difference between inlet
