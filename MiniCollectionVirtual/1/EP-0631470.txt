Divergent otter board for spacing the wings of a 
trawl net, this board being generally rectangular in 

shape and being provided with a float (2) on its upper 
end so that it assumes an upright position in the water 

when stationary, characterised in that it has on the 
front of its internal face a projecting member (9) with 

a traction cable (D) which is its only link with the 
fishing rig, it has a buoyancy of zero or close to zero, 

it defines in the direction of its longitudinal median 
axis (X-X') along at least one of its faces alongside the 

length of the float (2) a passage for water which narrows 
towards the rear and it has means allowing the 

inclination of its median axis (X-X') to be adjusted when 
stationary in the water. 
A board as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that it has a positive buoyancy. 
A board as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that on the end opposite the float (2), it has a 

ballast weight (4), the longitudinal position of which 
can be adjusted. 
A board as claimed in claim 3, characterised in 
that its body essentially consists of a plate (1) on the 

upper and lower ends of which are disposed respectively 
the float (2), which is tubular in shape, and another 

element which is also tubular (3) bearing the ballast 
weight (4) disposed symmetrically on either side of the 

median axis (X-X') and oriented so as to define between 
them the said passage for water narrowing towards the 

rear. 
A board as claimed in claim 4, characterised in 
that this plate (1) has a median fold (1a) and two lower 

(1b) and upper (1c) folds such that its vertical profile 
is in the shape of a flared V, the branches of which are  

 
extended by wings, this V opening towards the exterior. 
A board as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the plate (1) extends to the front and has a front 

deflector (13) which is a plate welded to the external 
face of the plate (1) by its lower and upper ends on 

either side of the axis (X-X') and forming an acute 
angle with this axis opening towards the front. 
A board as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the float (2) and the tubular element (3) extend 

beyond the front of the plate (1) and the ends thereof 
are cut to a rounded shape towards the exterior joined by 

a curved plate (7). 
A board as claimed in claim 7, characterised in 
that the curved plate 7 has a vertical slit (8) not far 

from its front edge. 
A board as claimed in one of claims 5 to 7, 
characterised in that it also has a rear deflector (11), 

which is a trapezoidal plate welded to the external face 
of the plate (1) by its lower and upper ends on either 

side of the axis (X-X'). 
A board as claimed in one of claims 4 to 9, 
characterised in that the underside portion of the 

tubular element (3) is provided with a sole plate (6). 
A board as claimed in one of claims 4 to 9, 
characterised in that it also has at its rear part a 

median element 15 projecting on the internal face of the 
plate (1) to increase the streamlining effect of the 

float (2) and the tubular element (3). 
A board as claimed in one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the hooking member (9) thereof has 

several orifices (10) aligned essentially parallel with 
(X-X') so that the longitudinal position at which the 

board is hooked to its traction cable (D) can be 
adjusted. 
A board as claimed in one of claims 1 to 12,  
 

characterised in that it also has at the rear, on the 
median axis (X-X'), a hooking point (12) for the end of 

a loose end (T) the other end of which is secured to a 
point of the traction cable (D), the end (T) serving to 

limit the angle between the board and the traction cable 
(D) and stabilise the rear of the board transversely. 
A board as claimed in one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that it is so balanced that its axis (X-X') 

has a slightly positive inclination relative to the 
horizontal when it is stationary in the water. 
A board as claimed in one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that it is so balanced that its axis (X-X') 

has a negative inclination when it is stationary in 
the water so that it can be used as a sinking spacer 

board (Pb). 
A board as claimed in claim 15, characterised in 
that the hooking member (9) is offset downwards relative 

to the plane of symmetry passing through (X-X'). 
A board as claimed in claim 15 or 16, 
characterised in that it is joined at a point of a trawl 

warp (F) remote from the fishing equipment so that it 

imparts a two-stage inclination thereto.
