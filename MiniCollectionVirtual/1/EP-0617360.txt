<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for introducing to a user a 
new/enhanced function of a computer software application. 

After learning the basics of a computer software application, 
new/enhanced functions are presented to the user 

based upon completion of predetermined criteria. The 
predetermined criteria may comprise the passage of time or 

the completion of a specified number of uses of a certain 
function.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to computer 
software, and in particular to a method and apparatus for 
introducing new functions in a computer program based upon 
a user's familiarity with the basics of the program. Computer software products are available in a myriad 
of areas. There are software products that keep a daily 
calendar, provide a phone book, provide tax preparation, 
have accounting information, receive and send electronic 
mail, do word processing, and so on. These software products 
may have a rich set of available functions which can 
overwhelm an initial or novice user. There are numerous 
shortcuts, editing aids, help functions, menus, etc., 
which are typically learned only through time by experimentation 
and continued usage. However, since a novice 
user may have sufficient difficulty just getting adjusted 
to the basics of a program, he/she may never want or be 
able to use some of the more sophisticated functions. In 
some cases, a novice user may become so overwhelmed with 
the available functions on a software product that the 
product may not be used at all or used on such a limited 
basis as to make it cost ineffective. Traditionally, software is delivered to a customer 
with paper documentation (a manual) to describe the full 
functions of the product. Thus a novice user, or even a 
more experience user, may have to resort to a manual to 
understand how certain functions work and interact with 
other functions. A manual can be as overwhelming as the  
 
many features available on the software. Many users shy 
away from manuals because they may be difficult, as well 
as time-consuming to use. Software packages may also be provided with help 
functions. Sometimes help functions are too little or too 
much. In an attempt to resolve this problem, it is known 
in the art to provide automatically adjustable help information. 
For example, when a software application is initially 
installed, it is assumed that the user is inexperienced 
and therefore, help functions are more detailed. As 
usage of the software increases, it is assumed that the 
user has learned the basics and therefore, the help information 
displayed becomes progressively less detailed. While a paper documentation of software may always be 
necessary, it is not always desirable to need to refer to 
the paper documentation to learn about more advanced functions. 
Thus, there is a need for a method and apparatus 
which introduces more advanced functions of a software 
application as the user becomes more
