<ABSTRACT>
A method for improving the printing of polyolefins 
with water-based inks by incorporating into the polyolefin 

an effective amount of N-ethanol erucamide or N-ethanol 
oleamide. Optionally a finely divided inorganic material 

can be added with the N-ethanol erucamide or N-ethanol 
oleamide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improving the adhesion
of water-based inks to polyolefin polymers. In particular
this invention is directed to improving the printing of
polyolefin films with water-based inks. An important
aspect of the present invention is the improved adhesion
of water-based inks to polyolefins by using N-ethanol
erucamide and/or N-ethanol oleamide in the polyolefins.Olefin homopolymers and copolymers are of
commercial importance for the manufacturer of numerous
articles such as films and other items. In order to be
useful for many of these functions it is desirable that
the polyolefinic composition have good slip
characteristics. This can be determined by measuring the
coefficient of friction of the polyolefin. It is of
increasing importance that the polyolefinic composition
have excellent adhesion to water-based inks.In order to obtain a satisfactorily low
coefficient of friction, often slip agents are added to
the polyolefin to lower its coefficient of friction below
about 0.5, preferably below 0.3. Many slip agents and
other additives for polyolefins are disclosed in the
literature. These additives will lower the coefficient of
friction of the polyolefin to desired levels, permitting
ready handling of shaped articles and films prepared from
the polyolefinic material. Polyolefinic polymers having
poor slip characteristics are difficult to handle when the
polymer is manufactured in the customary manner of large
rolls. During storage and subsequent processing, the low
slip films tend to adhere layer to layer. Also such films
can encounter large frictional forces in processing
equipment that often cause distortions and even tearing of
the film, especially when using thin film. Rowland et al US-A-2,956,979
discloses inhibiting the blocking tendencies of
polyethylene by introducing into the composition a small
amount of an alkylol amide of the structural formula:

wherein R is a saturated aliphatic acyl radical of from
about 18 to about 30 carbon atoms and R' is an alkyl
radical group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Toy et al US-A-3,028,355
discloses the use of diatomaceous
earth to reduce the tendency of polyethylene to block.
Haeske et al US-A-3,266,924 discloses the
blending of a mixture of finely divided siliceous material
and a fatty acid amide slip agent into polyethylene to
enhance its slip and blocking properties. Ross et al US-A-3,326,840
discloses the incorporation of a
small amount of a mono-N-substituted saturated carboxylic
acid amide of the formula:

wherein R is an aliphatic acyl
