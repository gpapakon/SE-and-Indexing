<ABSTRACT>
An anchoring device in the shape of a post, intended to be put into the ground, which post comprises two axially relatively movable parts and a transversally expansible portion (10A) adapted to be actuated for expansion upon relative movement between the parts for the purpose of anchoring the post in the ground, wherein one part forms the actual post in the shape of a rod (10) having an outermost end and an innermost end, whereas the other part consists of a tube (10), surrounding the rod. The rod (10) and the tube (11) are so dimensioned longitudinally that the outermost end of the rod, upon the axial relative movement of the rod and the tube for radial expansion of the anchoring elements, is in flush with or slightly inwardly of the outer end of the tube, and wherein the outermost end of the rod is provided with an inner thread for threaded engagement with a fastener means in the shape of a screw (15), and wherein therebetween the screw (15) and the outermost end of the rod is insertable an abutment member (16) to lock the rod and the tube against axial relative movements, as the screw (15) engages lockingly with the rod (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anchoring device 
for anchoring or holding of a plurality of different objects 
in a base, such as in the ground. The invention is applicable on anchoring of a plurality 
of different kinds of objects in a base, such as in 
the 
ground, for instance, but as the invention has been created 
in connection with certain works for anchoring of 
posts in the ground it will, for simplicity, be disclosed 
in the following essentially with reference to such a use, 
however without being restricted to only that field of 
use. WO 88/08066 discloses an arrangement in posts, 
adapted to be set in the ground, wherein the post comprises 
two parts relatively movable in their axial direction, 
and a device which is expansible transversely of the post, 
adapted to be actuated for expansion upon relative movement 
between the parts for the purpose of anchoring the 
post in the ground. One of the parts forms the actual post 
in the shape of a rod, whereas the other part is formed by 
a tube surrounding the rod. The expansible device comprises 
a sleeve which is arranged around the rod and which is 
provided with cuts which extend longitudinally along a 
portion of the sleeve from one end thereof towards the 
other end thereof. The sleeve is adapted to be supported 
by the rod in at least one direction along the geometrical 
axis of the rod. The tube is adapted, with one end thereof, 
to actuate the sleeve at the end thereof which is remote 
from the end wherefrom the cuts extend, viz. in order 
to cause the sleeve portions disposed between the cuts to 
move radially outwardly. Further, the device according to 
that patent specification comprises protruding, winglike 
members to engage with the ground adjacent to the ground 
surface or immediately beneath the same to stabilize the 
post against transverse forces. The characterizing feature of the device according to 
the above mentioned patent specification is that the wing-like 
members are secured to the tube adjacent to the upper  
 
end thereof in order to stabilize the tube, whereby the 
tube in its turn is adapted to stabilize the rod, which is 
held therein with small play, as the post, composed of the 
rod and the tube, is arranged in the ground. A special feature of the device according to the above 
mentioned specification is that the wing-like members 
are oriented vertically and between themselves form an 
angle of about 90 degrees, and in that the wing-like members 
have uppermost edges parallel to planes that are

<CLAIMS>
An anchoring device, particularly in the shape of 
an elongated post, intended to be put into the ground, 

which pcst comprises two axially relatively movable parts 
(10, 11) and a transversally expansible portion (10A) adapted 

to be actuated for expansion upon relative movement 
between the parts for the purpose of anchoring the post in 

the ground, and wherein one part forms the actual post in 
the shape of a rod (10) having an outermost end (19) and 

an innermost end (20), whereas the other part consists of 
a tube (11), surrounding the rod and having an outermost 

end (21) and an innermost end (22), and wherein the expansible 
portion comprises a radially expansible anchoring 

element (10A), e.g. in the shape of a sleeve, surrounding 
the rod and having cuts which extend along a part of the 

sleeve, from one end thereof in direction towards the 
other end, which sleeve is adapted to rest against the rod 

in at least one direction along the geometrical axis of 
the post, whereas the tube is adapted, with its inner end, 

(22) to actuate the sleeve at the end thereof, from where 
the cuts start, so as to expand the sleeve portions between 

the cuts radially outwardly, 
characterized
 in that 
the anchoring device is designed in such a manner, 


that the rod (10) and the tube (11) are dimensioned 
longitudinally so that the outermost end (19) of the 

rod, upon the axial relative movement of the rod and 
the tube for radial expansion of the anchoring elements 

(10A), is in flush with or slightly inwardly of 
the outer end (21) of the tube, 
that the outermost end (19) of the rod is adapted for 
locking engagement with a fastener means and is preferably 

provided with an inner thread (14) for threadedly 
engagement with a screw (15), serving as a fastener 

means, and 
in that there between the fastener means 
(15) and the outermost (19) end of the rod is insertable  

 
an abutment member (16) to lock the rod and the 

tube against axial relative movements, as the fastener 
means (15) engages lockingly with the 

rod. 
An anchoring device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized 
in
 that the rod (10), at the outermost end thereof, 
has affixed thereto, as by welding, a sleeve (12) with 

an inner thread. 
An anchoring device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in
 that the fastener element is in the shape 
of an element which is yielding, preferably breakable, by 

exceeding of a predetermined load, particularly in the 
shape of screw (15) with a head, made of nylon or the like. 
An anchoring device as claimed in one of claims 1-3, 

characterized in
 that the locking element (16) is designed 
as an adaptor, viz. in that it is provided with 

holding means, e.g. in the shape of a tubular post holder 
(18), a ring shaped fastening eye bolt or the like. 
An anchoring device as claimed in on of claims 1-4, 

characterized in
 that the locking means (16) has, on 
the under surface thereof, a guide tube (17) which fits

An anchoring device as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized 
in
