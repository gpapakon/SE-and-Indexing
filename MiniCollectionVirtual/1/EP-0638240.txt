<ABSTRACT>
The vacuum tumbler has a drum (3) which is mounted so as to be rotatable about its longitudinal axis (11), can be evacuated and is provided on one end face with a loading aperture (12) and on the other end face with a removal aperture (12'). To achieve continuous operation, it is proposed that a vacuum sluice (19, 19') be connected both to the loading aperture (12) and to the removal aperture (12') and that between both apertures (12, 12'), and the associated vacuum sluice (19, 19') there be situated in each case a vacuum seal (17) which also operates when the drum (3) is rotated.

A method for the treatment of portions of meat or other portioned foods, where the
portions are subjected to at least one agent (32, 33, 34) in a vacuum tumbler for a certain period

of time, the steps incuding,

that the said portions are conveyed continuously through a first vacuum sluice (19) to a
treatment zone (3) in the vacuum tumbler,
the portions are conveyed continuously along a path through the treatment zone (3), where
they are periodically passed along helical path sections, in the said process they are turned and,

under vacuum, subjected to a liquid agent (33, 34), and
the said portions are conveyed continuously through a second vacuum sluice (19') from the
treatment zone (3) inside the vacuum tumbler.
Procedure according to claim 
1
, characterised in, that a plurality of portions is subdivided
into charges containing several portions, and that the charges are conveyed, one after

the other, into the treatment zone (3).
Procedure according to claim 
1
 or 
2
, characterised in, that an agent (33, 34) is a coolant,
like a fast vaporising liquid or a fast subliming medium.
Procedure according to one of the claims 
1
 t
o 3
, characterised in, that an agent ( 33, 34)
is a liquid that contains condiments, a salt, a preservative and/or a dye in either solved,

suspended, emulsified or blended form.
Vacuum tumbler for performing the procedure according to claim 
1
, especially for
treating of pieces of meat or other portioned foods with an evacuatable drum (3) pivoted on its

longitudinal axis (11) , the drum having at one end a loading opening (12) and at the other end a
removal opening (12') and said drum exerting a conveying action on the loaded goods from the

loading opening (12) to the removal opening (12'), characterised in, that a vacuum sluice (19,
19') is connected to both, the loading opening (12) and the removal opening (12'), and that

there is provided on each side a vacuum seal (17), between both openings (12, 12') and the
affiliated vacuum sluice (19, 19'), that is also effective when the drum (3) is rotating.
Vacuum tumbler according to claim 
5
, characterised in, that at least the sluice (19)
which is allocated to the loading opening (12) is a metering sluice that is preferably a bucket

wheel and/or a slide sluice.
Vacuum tumbler according to claim 
5
 or 
6
, characterised in, that the drum (3) comprises
a helix (29) within it.
Vacuum tumbler according to claim 
7
, characterised in, that there is provided no, or only
a small distance of few millimetres between the helix (29) and the inner wall of the drum. 
Vacuum tumbler according to claim 
7
, characterised in, that the drum (3) undergoes one
revolution during one operating cycle of either one of said vacuum sluices (19, 19').
Vacuum tumbler according to one of the claims 
5
 to 
9
, characterised in, that each of the
end walls (9,9') comprises a central wall section (10, 10') with a circular peripheral surrounding

surface (13, 13') which does not rotate coaxial with the axis (11) of the drum and where the
loading and unloading opening (12, 12') are located, and around which the drum shell (15)

rotates.
Vacuum tumbler according to claim 
10
, characterised in, that each of the end walls (9,
9') comprises an annular wall section (14, 14') that is closely connected to the drum shell (15)

and rotates with it, the annular wall section (14, 14') surrounding the central wall section (10,
10'), and in that an annular vacuum seal (17, 17') is placed in between the wall sections (10, 14

respectively 10', 14').
Vacuum tumbler according to claim 
10
 or 
11
, characterised in, that the central wall
section (10, 10') is swingably supported by an axis which is orientated transversely to the

longitudinal axis (11) of the drum and preferably in the span of the longitudinal axis of the drum,
and with which it is displaceable in direction of the longitudinal axis (11) of the drum.
Vacuum tumbler according to one of the claims 
10
 to 
12
, characterised in, that at least in
one of the central wall sections (10, 10') there are connections (32-34 ) for a vacuum line and/or

a line for the addition of a treatment ingredient (5) and/or a gas for the thermal influencing of the
goods being treated.
Vacuum tumbler according to one of the claims 
7
 to 
13
, characterised in, that the drum
(3) and its shell (15) are rotably supported on rolls (2), and that the said system can be driven by

a circumferential gear rim (4).
