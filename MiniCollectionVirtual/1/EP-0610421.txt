<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition and process 
for forming a phosphate conversion coating on active metal 
surfaces in order to increase the corrosion resistance of 
the surfaces, either as treated or after subsequent conventional 
overcoating of the conversion coating layer formed 
by an organic based protective coating such as a paint or 
lacquer. Unlike many of the other compositions known for 
this general purpose, a composition according to this 
invention is well adapted to treating any of a variety of 
base metals, including at least steel and galvanized steel, 
zinc and zinc based alloys, aluminum and aluminum based 
alloys, and magnesium and magnesium based alloys. The 
composition and method of the invention are therefore 
especially well adapted to treating objects having surfaces 
including more than one type of active metal to be 
protected against corrosion. A wide variety of phosphate conversion coating compositions  
 
and processes are already described in the art. 
Those believed to be most closely related to the present 
invention are described below. U. S. A 4,865,653 
teaches the use of hydroxylamine or agents that react in 
water to produce hydroxylamine in zinc phosphating solutions 
to expand the range of zinc concentrations over which 
the most desirable coating morphology for a zinc phosphate 
Conversion coating can be obtained. Ferrous, zinciferous, 
and aluminum surfaces can all be coated with the compositions 
and processes taught by this reference. U. S. 4,637,838 
teaches zinc phosphating solutions optionally containing 
nitrobenzene sulfonate, nitrilotriacetate, fluoride and 
complex fluoride anions, and/or chelators such as citrate 
and tartrate. U. S. A 4,149,909 
teaches using a combination of accelerators including an 
oxidizing agent such as a chlorate or bromate in conjunction 
with a reducing agent such as hydroxylamine sulfate to 
phosphate ferrous metal surfaces at low temperatures to 
produce an iron phosphate coating with good salt spray corrosion 
resistance. U. S. A 4,148,670 
teaches treating aluminum with an aqueous composition comprising 
a zirconium or titanium compound which may be the 
fluozirconate or fluotitanate, a fluoride compound which 
may also be the noted complex fluoride compounds, and phosphate 
ions. U. S. A 3,619,300 
teaches zinc phosphate conversion coating compositions 
containing zinc, phosphate, nitrate, and nitrite ions along 
with a combination of fluoride and bifluorides of sodium 
and potassium and teaches that such
