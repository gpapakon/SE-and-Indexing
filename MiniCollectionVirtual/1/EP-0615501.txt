<ABSTRACT>
Bearing device with reduced play for a power steering system comprising a first bearing (7) for absorbing axial forces exerted on the steering shaft (3) towards its first end. A second bearing (8a, 8b, 8c) transmits to the housing (1) the opposite axial forces to which the shaft (3) is subjected, the second bearing being urged towards the first shaft end (3a) by an elastic force greater than said opposite axial forces and exerted by a Belleville washer (9).

Rolling-contact bearing device with reduced 
clearance for a power-assisted steering system of the 

type of those which comprise: 

a casing (1) having a sealed internal volume which 
at least partially assumes the form of a cylinder of 

revolution (1a) about an axis (2); 
a shaft (3) housed in the internal volume of the 
casing along the direction of this axis, translationally 

fixed along this direction and rotationally 
driven about this axis, from the outside of the 

casing, by the application of an input torque on a 
first (3a) of its two ends; 
a piston (4) sliding axially in the internal volume 
of the casing so as to separate this volume into two 

sealed pressure chambers (1b, 1c) subjected to 
respective pressures varying as a function of the 

said input torque, these pressures exerting on the 
piston a translational force which can be converted 

into an output torque; and 
a movement converter (6a, 6b, 6c), arranged between 
the piston and the shaft in the vicinity of the 

second end (3b) of the latter, so as to convert a 
rotational movement of the shaft into a translational 

movement of the piston, the shaft thus being 
subjected to axial forces of variable intensity and 

direction as a function of the input torque, and 
this device comprising at least a first rolling-contact 

bearing (7) arranged between the first end 
of the shaft and the casing so as to transmit to the 

latter the axial forces being exerted on the shaft  
 

from its second end towards the first, 
a second rolling-contact bearing (8a, 8b, 8c; 10b, 
12a, 16) arranged between the first end of the shaft 

and the casing, 
 
characterized in that the shaft has, in the vicinity of 

its first end, an annular peripheral groove (3d) of right 
triangular cross section, forming two conical rolling 

surfaces (10a, 10b) centered on the axis (2), a first 
(10a) of these two surfaces being rather turned towards 

the first end (3a) of the shaft and the second surface 
(10b) being rather turned towards the second end (3b) of 

the shaft, in that the casing (1) has, facing the first 
rolling surface, a third rolling surface (11a) parallel 

to the first, in that a removable ring (12) is arranged 
around the axis in the immediate proximity of the third 

rolling surface (11a) so as to offer a fourth rolling 
surface (12a) facing the second (10b) and parallel to it, 

in that first rollers (15) are arranged between the first 
and third rolling surfaces so as to roll thereon and to 

form the said first rolling-contact bearing, in that 
second rollers (16) are arranged between the second and 

fourth rolling surfaces to roll thereon and to form the 
said second rolling-contact bearing, and in that elastic 

means (9, 14) bearing on the casing are provided so as to 
exert on the shaft, via the second rolling-contact 

bearing, an axial force directed from the second end of 
this shaft towards the first, and of greater intensity 

than the axial forces in the opposite direction to which 
this shaft is subjected, these elastic means forcing the 

said ring in a direction which tends to move the fourth 
rolling surface closer to the second. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the first rollers (15) are more numerous than the 

second rollers (16).
