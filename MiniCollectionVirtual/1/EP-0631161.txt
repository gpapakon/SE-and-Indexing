<ABSTRACT>
A fiber optic connector is described, which has a retention clip (100, Fig. 4) that is 
part of the terminus so the clip (100) is removed with the terminus from a connector 

housing, to enable replacement of a broken clip as well as to provide a more 
compact and low cost connector. The clip (100) has a rear end (102) forming a 

ring that slides along the terminus body, and has a plurality of tines (104 - 107) 
that extend forwardly and radially outwardly. The free forward end of each tine has 

a rearwardly-facing clip shoulder (112) which abuts a forwardly-facing housing 
shoulder (114) so the clip cannot be removed in a rearward direction until the tines 

are deflected together. The front ends of the tines abut the rear end (92) of a 
spring (86) that lies around the terminus body. The termini of the plug and receptacle 

connectors are identical except that one of the connectors (14, Fig. 5) uses 
a spacer (140) in place of a helical spring (86).

<DESCRIPTION>
A presently used fiber optic connector arrangement uses a terminus in each 
connector that includes a ceramic ferrule, with the front tip of an optical fiber lying 
flush with the tip of the ferrule. The ferrules of mating connectors have their tips 
abutting, with the ferrules maintained concentric by a guide sleeve lying in one of 
the connectors. It is necessary to clean each terminus to remove wear debris that 
could reduce optical coupling. To facilitate removal, each terminus is held in a 
passage of the connector housing by a clip that can be released by a release tool. 
To facilitate mounting of the guide sleeve near the front of one of the connectors, 
it is desirable to enable the terminus to be installed and removed from the rear of 
the housing. Present optical termini are built to work with contact retention mechanisms identical 
to those of electrical contacts. In electrical contacts, the insert which contains the 
electrical contacts has to be constructed of easily formed insulative materials such 
as injection molded plastic. Because of the relatively high thermal coefficient of 
expansion of common engineering plastics, because of the tolerances encountered 
in injection molding, and because the inserts align with only limited accuracy during 
mating, each contact-receiving passage has to provide substantial space around 
each contact, especially to receive the rear release clip. A rear release clip is 
permanently installed in each housing passage. As a result, if a clip becomes 
damaged, then that housing passage might become nonusable. The permanently 
installed clip has to allow passage of the spring and all other portions of the 
terminus lying forward of the clip, so the clip has to be expandable to a considerable 
diameter and therefore has to have a large diameter. Moreover, the clips must 
be dielectrically isolated from one another, requiring a considerable space between 
the clips.  The termini for standard plug optical connectors are usually very different from the 
termini for standard receptacle optical connectors. A fiber optic connector which 
enabled removal of the clip with the rest of the terminus so a damaged clip could 
be removed, which used common components on pin and socket termini, and 
which enabled the connector to be constructed with more closely spaced termini, 
would be of considerable value. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a fiber optic connector 
and a retention clip therefor are provided which enable a connector with a given
