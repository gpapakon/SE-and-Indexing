<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of moulded articles (mouldings) having a density of at least 150 kg/m
<
3
>
 from polyurethane foams having a compact surface by foam moulding of a polyurethane-forming starting mixture, where the blowing agent used is a compound of the formula I  HOOC-R-COOH   I  where R is a CH2 group or a CH=CH group, and/or of the formula II 
<
IMAGE
>
 where R
<
1
>
 and R
<
2
>
, independently of one another, are hydrogen or alkyl radicals having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, some of whose hydrogen atoms may be substituted by OH groups.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of polyurethane foam 
mouldings having a compact surface and a gross density 

of at least 150 kg/m
3
 by foaming a reaction mixture of 

a) a polyisocyanate component consisting of at least 
one aromatic polyisocyanate, 
b) a reactive component consisting of at least one 
organic compound having at least two groups 

reactive towards isocyanate groups, 
c) urethane- and urea-forming activators, 
d) optionally other auxiliaries and additives, 
e) optionally water and 
f) organic blowing agents 
 
in moulds, an isocyanate index of 75 to 200 being 

maintained, characterized in that the blowing agents 
f) used are compounds of general formula I: 


HOOC-R-COOH
 
in which 


R
is a CH
2
 group or a CH=CH group, 
and/or of formula II: 


  
 

in which 

R
1
 and R
2
independently of one another are a hydrogen 
radical or an alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms 

in which some of the hydrogen atoms may be replaced 
with OH groups, 
 
and their salts. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
malonic acid is used as the blowing agent f). 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
citric acid is used as the blowing agent f). 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
propyl citrate is used as the blowing agent f). 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
hydroxypropyl citrate is used as the blowing agent f). 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
maleic acid is used as the blowing agent f). 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
at least two compounds from the group consisting of 

malonic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, propyl citrate 
and hydroxypropyl citrate are used as the blowing 

agent f). 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
compounds of formula II in which R
1
 is an alkyl radical 
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in which some of the 

hydrogen atoms may be replaced with OH groups, and R
2
  
 

is a hydrogen radical, are used as the blowing agent 
f). 
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the blowing agent f) is used in 

amounts of 0.1 to 5.0 parts by weight, based on 
component b). 
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the blowing agents I and II are 

used in the form of their alkanolamine salts. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
zeolites which enlarge the skin zone, and/or silica 

gels, are used as other auxiliaries d).
