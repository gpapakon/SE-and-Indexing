<ABSTRACT>
A rotary internal combustion engine wherein the 
cylinders making up the engine block are radially disposed in 

a common plane and rotate with the output shaft. The engine 
block rotates within a surrounding cam surface and the pistons 

in each cylinder move radially in and out in a motion 
geometrically defined by connecting rods, a rocker arm pivoted 

at a point fixed with respect to the rotating engine block and 
a cam follower which rides on the cam surface. The rocker arm 

preferably is counterbalanced to reduce centrifugal forces on 
the cam surface. The cam surface is contoured to produce the 

motion to the pistons by means of the linkage as the engine 
block rotates. The engine block 
includes a rotary valve port 
associated with each cylinder. The engine block rotates into 

cooperating relationship with stationary inlet and exhaust 
ports in the engine housing to provide intake and exhaust 

cycles. The power stroke for each cylinder is radially 
outward and the piston drive linkage and cam slope are 

arranged to convert the radial forces into shaft torque. The 
engine has means for varying the compression during operation. 

A novel oil cooling system with centrifugally assisted 
circulation is also provided. The rotary engines can be 

selectively connected in series to form a multibank engine. 
The rotary engine of the present invention is ideal for 

powering light airplanes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to internal 
combustion engines and more particularly to rotary 
internal combustion engines where the engine block 
housing the cylinders is directly coupled to an output 
shaft and the engine block rotates about the axis of 
rotation of the output shaft. The conventional internal combustion engine 
is one where the cylinders, either in line or in a 
V-block, for instance, have the cylinder connecting 
rods connected to a crank shaft and the crank shaft is 
rotatably driven by the combustion of the fuel mixture 
within the cylinders. The typical combustion cycle 
includes intake of an air-fuel mixture into the 
cylinder, compression of the air-fuel mixture by the 
piston, combustion which causes a rapid expansion of 
the gases within the cylinder to drive the piston and 
perform work, and the subsequent exhaust stroke 
evacuating the products of combustion. In a four 
stroke crank-type engine, the power or expansion stroke 
occurs once in each 720° of rotation of the crank 
shaft. This conventional internal combustion engine 
also requires an intake and exhaust valve for each 
cylinder which must be timed to open and close in 
synchronization with the cycle of the pistons. The 
valves in a conventional internal combustion engine are 
poppet valves which have a stem and a mushroom shaped 
head with edges seating on the periphery of a valve 
opening and which are opened and closed by synchronized 
cams. Because the seating faces of the exhaust valves 
in internal combustion engines are subjected to 
extremely high temperatures they tend to burn, oxidize 
or provide a source of pre-ignition. Pre-ignition is 
frequently a source of damaging engine knock.  
 
Accordingly, it is necessary to cool the valve, limit 
operating temperature and/or maintain a reducing 
atmosphere during combustion. In a conventional engine 
this is accomplished by using an excess of fuel, i.e. a 
rich mixture, over that necessary to support the 
combustion process. This excess fuel is utilized as a 
coolant for the exhaust valve as well as insuring that 
there is no free oxygen at the end of the combustion 
process, which could oxidize the valves. Because 
excess fuel is supplied to the cylinders, all the fuel 
is not completely combusted and unburned hydrocarbons 
from the uncombusted fuel are exhausted through the 
exhaust valves and the exhaust manifold system rather 
than contributing to the output power. Because of 
this, the exhaust gas from the internal combustion 
engine pollutes the
