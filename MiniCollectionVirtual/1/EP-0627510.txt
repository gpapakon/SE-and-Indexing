<ABSTRACT>
The opening roller (1) of a fibre-separating device of an open-end spinning machine contains a cylindrical body (2) equipped on its outer circumference with teeth (3) which are formed as a result of the penetration of at least one helical groove (5) with a number of recesses (6). The recesses (6) extend on the circumference of the cylindrical body (2) at an angle to the generatrix (71) parallel to the axis (7) of the cylindrical body (2). The depth of the recesses is preferably greater than the depth of the helical groove. The helical groove preferably has a differently shaped bottom. The opening roller (1) is produced by simultaneously imparting rotational movement to the cylindrical body (2) while the recesses (6) are being made.

An opening roller of a fibre separating device of an open-end
spinning unit having a cylindrical body (2), the outer circumference of

which is fitted with teeth (3) formed by the penetration of at least one
helical groove (5) with a number of recesses (6)
wherein

the recesses (6) extend at the circumference of the cylindrical body
(2) at an angle (α) with respect to the generator line (71) parallel with

the axis (7) of the cylindrical body (2), the angle (α) does not exceed
45°, and the recesses (6) are formed in a direction perpendicular to

the helical groove (5).
The opening roller according to Claim 1 
wherein
 the bottom (51) of
the helical groove (5) has a cross-section shaped as a curved line

(52') which merges smoothly at the edges into the faces (32) of the
teeth (3).
The opening roller according to one of Claims 1 or 2 
wherein
 the
bottom (51) of the helical groove (5) has a cross-section with straight

lines which pass over at the edges into the faces (32) of the teeth (3)
via curved lines (52).
The opening roller according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
wherein the bottom (51) of the helical groove (5) has a cross section

with a bulge (54).
An opening roller of a fibre separating device of an open-end
spinning device having a cylindrical body (2), the outer circumference 

of which has teeth (3) formed by the penetration of at least one
helical groove (5) with a number of recesses (6), 
wherein
 the bottom
(51) of the helical groove (5) has a cross section with a bulge (54).
The opening roller according to Claim 5, 
wherein
 the bulge (54) of
the bottom (51) passes over at the edges into the faces (32) of the

teeth (3) via curved lines (52).
The opening roller according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6,

wherein
 the side walls of the helical groove (5) are formed in such a
way that the helical groove (5) widens from the bottom (51) towards

the tip (36) of the teeth.
The opening roller according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7,

wherein
 the depth of the recesses (6) is larger than the depth of the
helical groove (5).
An opening roller of the fibre separating device of an open-end
spinning unit having a cylindrical body (2) which has teeth on its

outer circumference formed by the penetration of at least one helical
groove (5) with a number of recesses (6), 
wherein
 the depth of the
recesses (6) is larger than the depth of the helical groove (5).
The opening roller according to Claim 9, 
wherein
 the depth of the
recesses (6) is larger than the depth of the helical groove (5) by a

factor ranging between 0.05 and 0.5.
The opening roller according to one or more of Claims 1 to 10,

wherein
 the depth of the recesses (6) changes cyclically across the
circumference of the cylindrical body (2).

12, but not of 8 to 10, 
wherein
 the depth of the recesses (6) is
smaller than the depth of the helical groove (5).
The opening roller according to one or more of Claims 1 to 13,

wherein
 the front end (22) of the cylindrical body (2) has flanges (4)
whose diameter corresponds at least to the tip diameter (31) of the

teeth (3).
The opening roller according to one or more of Claims 1 to 14,

wherein
 the cylindrical body (2) is made from hardening steel.
The opening roller according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, 11, 12,
14 or 15, but not of 8 to 10 or 13, 
wherein
 the depth of the recesses
(6) is the same as the depth of the helical groove (5).
