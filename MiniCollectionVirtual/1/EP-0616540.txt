<ABSTRACT>
An improved on-line real time hemodialysis monitoring system for hemodialysis treatment. The hemodialysis monitoring system quantitates the rate and amount of a constituent, such as urea, removedduring the hemodialysis treatment by measuring the constituent concentrations as a fonction of time in the spent dialysate effluent from a hemodialysis machine. A quantity of the spent dialysate effluent is removed from the dialysate effluent waste line periodically for testing. A urea concentration time profile can be analyzed to determine the urea removal, KT/V, URR, SRI and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) indices. The hemodialysis monitoring system preferably can obtain a dialysate sample equilibrated with the blood prior to the start of a hemodialysis treatment. The hemodialysis monitoring system includes a two pool analysis for taking into account the constituent concentration differences in the extracellular and intracellular spaces in the hemodialysis patient during the hemodialysis treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to hemodialysis machines, and
more particularly is directed to an apparatus and method for on line real time
monitoring of the effectiveness of the hemodialysis treatment.The use of dialyzer cartridges with hemodialysis machines to remove
blood-borne toxins and by-products of metabolism has been conventional for
many years. Typically, such a cartridge contains essentially a pair of chambers
separated by a semipermeable membrane. Blood is perfused through the first
chamber and returned to the patient. The dialysate solution is simultaneously
circulated in the opposite direction through the second chamber. A concentration
gradient thereby is established which causes waste products carried in the blood
to migrate through the semipermeable membrane and into the dialysate solution
to form the dialysate effluent.The principle of hemodialysis has been refined extensively. A number of
semipermeable hollow fiber membranes are now utilized in dialyzer cartridges to
greatly increase the total membrane surface area to facilitate diffusion across the 
membrane structure. The hollow fiber membranes include a variety of materials
including, for example, cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, polyacrylonitrile,
polysulfone, and regenerated cellulose, the latter being most commonly used.One of the most basic considerations in treating a patient with
hemodialysis revolves around treatment adequacy. For instance, how long should
a given patient be dialyzed on a given day. A number of medically adverse
effects may result from an inadvertent failure to sufficiently dialyze the patient.
At the present time, the average dialysis patient has a life expectancy of only
about five years. One reason these patients tend to have a short life expectancy
is the deleterious effect of a chronic buildup of various toxins that either are not
eliminated at all, i.e. do not pass through the hollow fibers, or are not sufficiently
reduced to nontoxic levels. The identity of many of these supposed toxins is not
known, although those species known to be eliminated in urine, such as urea,
creatinine, phosphate, hydrogen ions, etc. are associated with serious medical
consequences when permitted to accumulate in excess of normal levels.A number of factors can have a substantial effect on treatment adequacy.
For example, it is common practice in the field of hemodialysis to reuse the
dialysis cartridges. There is technology available for cleaning, disinfecting, or
sterilizing used dialysis cartridges, for
