<ABSTRACT>
The solid-state ion sensor of the present invention 
includes an inner electrode (4) comprising a metal and a 

water-insoluble salt of the metal which covers at least a 
part of the surface of the metal, an ion-selective membrane 

(2) selectively responsive to the ion species to be determined, 
and an intermediate layer comprising a hydrophilic 

polymeric membrane (3) provided between the inner electrode 
(4) and the ion-selective membrane (2). The inner electrode 

(4) comprises a metal and a halogenide of the metal which 
covers at least a part of the surface of the metal. In the 

hydrophilic polymeric membrane (3) is dispersed a hydrophilic 
electrolyte having halogen ions same as or different from 

those constituting the halogenide with the weight ratio of 
the electrolyte and the polymer [(electrolyte) wt%/polymer) 

wt%] being at least 1/100. A polymeric ion-conductor can be 

used as the hydrophilic polymeric membrane (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ion sensor
suitable for being set in apparatuses for analysis of
ion species contained in a biological fluid, for
example, blood analyzers for medical use, and more
particularly to a solid-state ion sensor which does not
need special electrolyte solution and which is small in
size and can comprise integrated ion sensors for multispecies.An ion-selective electrode is characterized by
selectively determining concentrations of specific ion
species in a solution and has been employed in various
fields including monitoring for ion concentration, water
analysis, etc. Particularly, in the medical field it is
applied to quantitative determination of ion species
contained in blood or biological fluids such as urine,
etc, for example, chloride ions, potassium ions, etc.
Since concentrations of specific ion species in a
biological fluids are closely related to metabolic
reactions of living bodies, diseases for high blood
pressure, diseases for kidney, diseases for neurosystem,
etc. are diagnosed by determining concentrations of
specific ion species.In the case of a ion-selective electrode,
between an activity a of ion species to be determined 
and an electrode potential E given by the ion-selective
electrode, a correlation that the logarithm of activity
a is proportional to a change in the electrode potential
E is established as shown by the following equation:
E = Eo + 2.303(RT/ZF)log a
and the activity a of ion species to be determined can
be simply calculated from measurements of the electrode
potential E. In this way, when an ion-selective
electrode is used, the quantitative determination of ion
species in a wide range of concentrations becomes
possible only by measuring the potential E. In the
above equation, R is a gas constant, T is an absolute
temperature, Z is a valency, F is a Faraday constant, Eo
is a standard electrode potential of the system and log
is a logarithm.Generally, as shown in Fig. 15, the
conventional ion-selective electrode containing an inner
solution comprises sensor body 51 filled with inner
solution 52, silver/silver chloride inner electrode 53
being dipped in the inner solution 52, ion-selective
membrane 54 being fixed at the center of the sensor body
51 along biological fluid channel 55. In the
conventional ion-selective electrode, an aqueous
electrolyte solution or an agar gel containing a
supporting electrolyte is used as the inner solution 52
which serves to conduct electricity between the ion-selective 
membrane 54 and the inner electrode 53
