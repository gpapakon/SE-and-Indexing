<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite
tube which is resistant to interaction with
chemicals conveyed therein and a method for making the
same. More particularly, this invention pertains to
composite tubing stock lined with a corrosion-resistant
material and a method for successfully producing the same.Composite tubes and methods producing the same are disclosed in DE-A-3 405 640 and FR-A 2 434 326.Small-diameter tubing, tubing stock having a
diameter less than about 1 inch and more particularly
between about 3/16 and about 3/4 inch, is used for a
variety of applications. Among these are brake linings,
fuel lines, and various conduits in a variety of non-automotive
uses. It is necessary that these products be
manufactured from durable materials which can withstand
prolonged use as well as bumps, jostling and the like. In
automotive applications, metals such as low-carbon steel
are the materials of choice for reasons of economy and
formability, for example. In other applications, other
metals or various polymeric materials have been employed.It is also necessary that the material of choice
be essentially non-reactive with the materials conveyed
within the tubing. Various fluids conveyed through the
tubing exhibit degrees of reactivity with interior tubing
surfaces. For instance, the components of various
alternate fuels for example methanol contained in fuels
such as M85 and ethanol in E85 can react with metals such
as low carbon steel to cause corrosion. The resulting
corrosion can weaken the tubing; eventually resulting in
rupture, leakage and premature failure. Additionally, even
materials which are not directly corrosive in a metallic
environment can render the metal susceptible to exterior 
galvanic corrosion. Thus, the useful life of conventional
low carbon steel is shortened even when conveying only
mildly reactive materials.Reactivity between the tubing and the materials
conveyed within it can also compromise the purity of the
conveyed fluid materials. Because of this, inexpensive
metal tubing cannot be used in a variety of applications
where possible fluid contamination with metal complexes,
liquids or the like are not acceptable. In such instances,
it is necessary to subject the tubing to post-formation
processes such as annealing or to resort to more expensive
tubing made of non-reactive metals or to tubing made from
polymeric materials.Polymeric tubing has been suggested as a
substitute in various instances to eliminate the problems
such as those previously discussed. Unfortunately,
