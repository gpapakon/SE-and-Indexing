<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control system comprising a motherboard (1) having at least two auxiliary card connectors (2A, 2B, 2C) and a control bus (6) on which control addresses and control data are transferred. Auxiliary cards (3A, 3B, 3C) are connected to the auxiliary card connectors of the motherboard, the auxiliary cards being essentially identical but having different control addresses for selective controlling through the control bus (6). In the present invention the control addresses of the auxiliary cards are card location-specific and provided (8A, 8B, 8C) on the motherboard by wiring or switches or in some other corresponding manner. When an auxiliary card is inserted in an auxiliary card connector of the motherboard, the auxiliary card always obtains the correct address from the motherboard through the connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a control system
comprising a motherboard having at least two auxiliary
card connectors and a common control bus on which
control addresses and control data are transferred, and
at least one auxiliary card inserted into one of the
auxiliary card connectors, the auxiliary card having a
control address for selective controlling through the
common control bus.In various kinds of control systems a master
unit typically controls slave units via a common control
bus. Each control unit connected to the bus has a control
address (identifier) for identifying the commands
addressed to it from among the commands given on the
common bus. In a module or circuit card implementing the
slave unit, the control address is made by a fixed
wiring, or the address can be set e.g. by switches.
Alternatively, every module or card may receive a dedicated
control signal from the master unit. A drawback
in this known solution is that with otherwise identical
cards, it is necessary to know the address set or to be
set to each card. The modules and cards used are thus
different in respect of production, selling, installation
or maintenance, and their installation requires
specific settings or tuning.The object of the invention is to provide a
control system in which the above problems are eliminated.This is achieved with a control system of the
type described in the first paragraph, the system 
according to the invention being characterised in that
the control address is card location-specific and the
control address of the auxiliary card is not determined
until the auxiliary card is inserted into an auxiliary
card connector, and that the motherboard has card
connector-specific control address encoding circuitry
associated with each of the auxiliary card connectors
for providing a card connector-specific control address
through the respective auxiliary card connector to a
respective auxiliary card when inserted, the auxiliary
card being arranged to read the corresponding card
connector-specific control address, the address
indicating to the auxiliary card which commands on the
common control bus are to be responded to in this card
location.In the present invention as claimed in claim 1 the control addresses
of the auxiliary cards are card connector-specific and
they are set by wiring, by switches or in some other
corresponding manner on the motherboard. When the auxiliary
card is connected to the auxiliary card connector
of the motherboard, the auxiliary card always obtains
the correct address from the
