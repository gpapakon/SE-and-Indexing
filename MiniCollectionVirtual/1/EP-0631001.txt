<ABSTRACT>
A method of providing a desired water level in a 
laundry machine by energizing the motor(10) of the machine 

intermittently to produce changes in velocity of the spin 
tub(3), agitator(4) and load of clothes in the spin tub(3). 
The changes in velocity are measured and from the 
measurements the mass of the load of clothes is determined 

by control means (15, 16, 17). A desired volume of water 
necessary for an optimum wash of the load of clothes is 

then determined and this volume of water is admitted to the 
washing container(2) of the laundry machine(1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to laundry machines and/or methods of controlling the
same.In conventional laundry machines the operator is generally required to select
a wash load size setting when beginning a wash cycle. The user must subjectively
select one of a limited number of load sizes. During the washing machine cycle the
washing machine is filled to a preset level depending on which selection has been
made by the user. Necessarily this means that there is a limited number of fill levels
and consequently the disadvantages of either underfilling or overfilling the wash
container for a given load would generally be realised to some extent. The selection
of the appropriate load size is left to the user and this will add additional error if the
user incorrectly specifies the load size.The disadvantages of incorrect wash size include the potential for additional
damage to clothing if insufficient water is provided and wasted water if an excess
of water is provided.To dispense with the operator judgement systems are also known wherein
the weight of clothes within the laundry machine is determined and this measure
used to select the appropriate water level.The washing machine of GB -A - 2063927 takes this one step further. The
laundry machine of that specification uses a method where a predetermined amount
of water is provided, the agitator is driven with a predetermined power for a
predetermined time, and a further amount of water is added dependent on the
number of revolutions of the agitator completed in that predetermined time. This is
said to provide compensation for different clothing types. A laundry machine is 
desired which will fill to an options level with minimal operator involvement, the
level being appropriate to the type and quantity of the clothes.It is an object of the present invention to provide a laundry machine and/or
methods of controlling the same which will provide an optimum water level for a load of clothes automatically without any information or decisions being supplied by the operator.Accordingly in one aspect the invention consists in a method of providing
a desired level of washing liquid in a laundry machine having a cabinet(1) a washing
container (2) within said cabinet, a rotatable assembly (3, 4, 10, 11) having a spin
tub (3) within said container (2) and an agitator (4) within said spin tub, a motor (10)
driving said agitator (4) conjointly with said spin tub (3) or separately on
disconnection of said spin tub from said agitator as required, and washing liquid
level control
