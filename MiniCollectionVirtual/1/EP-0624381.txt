<ABSTRACT>
A peel-away endoscopic retrograde cholangio 
pancreatography catheter and a method for using the same is 

provided. An endoscope having a passage therethrough is 
introduced into the mouth of a patient and is guided through 

the patent's gastroentral tract until an opening at the 
distal end of the endoscope is in close proximity with the 

papilla of vater leading to the common bile and pancreatic 
ducts. A peel-away ERCP catheter is provided which may be 

guided through the lumen of the endoscope until the distal 
tip of the catheter emerges from the opening at the distal 

end of the endoscope. The distal end of the catheter may be 
guided through the sphincter of oddi and into the common bile 

or pancreatic duct. A radiopaque dye may be injected through 
the catheter, into the duct. Additionally, a guide wire may 

be guided into the common bile or pancreatic duct through the 
catheter. Thereafter, the catheter may be easily removed 

without disturbing the placement of the guide wire by pulling 
on knobs attached to tabs at the proximal end of the catheter 

while the proximal end of the guide wire is held in place. 
The force applied to the catheter tabs causes the catheter to 

split longitudinally along two longitudinal grooves cut into 
the body of the catheter. Thus, the catheter peels-away from 

the guide wire without displacing the guide wire. 
Simultaneously, the pulling force on the tabs splits the 

catheter away from the guide wire while pulling the catheter 
up the guide wire. Additionally, a biliary stent can be 

pushed into the duct using a second peel-away catheter which 

may then be removed in accordance with the method of the 
present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medical device for introducing a guide wire into a common bile duct comprising a splittable or peel-away ERCP catheter
the distal end of which being insertable
into the common bile or pancreatic duct via an
endoscope which has been guided through the esophagus and
stomach and into the duodenum of a patient.In certain medical applications it is useful to provide a
sheath or catheter that is longitudinally splittable for ease
of removal from the human body. For example, the use of a
splittable catheter permits the removal of a catheter after a
guide wire or other material has been placed therethrough
without disturbing the guide wire. Various splittable
sheaths and catheters exist which have been designed to split
longitudinally along the body to peel-away from a catheter,
guide wire or other inserted material.U.S. Patent No. 4,776,846 to Wells discloses an apparatus
and method for preparing a catheter tube which has a
longitudinal line of weakness extending axially therealong as
a place for preferential splitting. The method includes
co-extruding two materials into the tubular cross-sectional
shape. One of the materials forms a surface line along the
other which extends readily to a level where the thickness of
the tubing cross-section thereat is less. When the
co-extruded extra material is removed, a grove is in the
surface of the tube, which groove permits easy tearing
therealong.U. S. Patent No. 4,983,168 to Moorehead discloses a
layered peel-away hollow sheath, for temporarily creating a 
passageway into a desired body site of a medical patient for
placement of one end of an indwelling device at the body site
through the sheath. The sheath wall comprises at least two
layers, the inside layer being cylindrical and the outside
layer comprising two semi-cylindrical segments defining
opposed axially directed slits or slots therebetween which
comprise tear lines such that the sheath manually tears
axially along the single layer tear lines into two pieces for
removal of the sheath from around the indwelling device.U.S. Patent No. 4,801,294 to Okada discloses a catheter
for nasogastric intubation comprising a plastic sheath tube
and a fixing means of said tube at nose, said tube having a
longitudinal tear-off line over the full length thereof and
having elasticity and rigidity slightly larger than those of
said catheter, said catheter being inserted in said plastic
sheath tube slidably.U.S. Patent No. 3,550,591 to McGregor discloses an
intravenous catheter unit which provides a
