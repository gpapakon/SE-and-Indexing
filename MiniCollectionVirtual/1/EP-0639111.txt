<DESCRIPTION>
 Adsorption Matrices1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION f 5The Technical FieldThe invention concerns novel thiophilic adsorption ma¬ trices, preferably for use in the isolation, purification 10 and immobilization of proteins from a liquid by salt- dependent adsorption chromatography, a process for produc¬ ing them, and a process for purifying protein, preferably immunoglobulin.15 Salt-dependent adsorption chromatography comprises binding proteins to an adsorption matrix in the presence of high concentrations of salts, in particular lyotropic (water- structure forming) salts. Specific binding of proteins is achieved by adjusting the salt concentration, and the20 bound proteins are eluted from the adsorption matrix by reducing the salt concentration in the medium.Salt-dependent adsorption matrices are known, including e.g. metal chelate matrices, hydrophobic matrices and ma-25 trices of thiophilic nature. In the present specification the designation "thiophilic adsorption matrices" means hydrophilic adsorption matrices comprising a vinyl sul¬ phone group to which a ligand is covalently bound, said matrices being capable of adsorbing proteins, such as30 serum proteins in the presence of high concentrations of lyotropic salts, such as alkali sulphates and alkali phos¬ phates. This particularly distinct thiophilic adsorptionI. nature is primarily believed to be caused by the sulphur atom in the divinyl sulphone group, to which should be 35 added that the degree of thiophilic nature can be intensi¬ fied or weakened by the ligand bound thereto. 

 Matrices exhibiting thiophilic adsorption are character¬ ized by binding proteins in another manner than hydropho¬ bic matrices. The differences are reflected i.a. in the fact that thiophilic matrices bind immunoglobulins from human serum much stronger than albumin at a given salt concentration. Albumin can be caused to bind to thiophilic matrices, but this typically requires a higher salt con¬ centration than is necessary for binding immunoglobulin. Hydrophobic matrices are characterized by binding albumin more strongly than immunoglobulin.Thiophilic adsorption matrices are used in particular in the fractionation of biopolymers, such as nucleic acids, nucleotides, and proteins, including serum proteins, immunoglobulins and enzymes, and other polypeptides.Two types of adsorption matrices having a distinct thio¬ philic nature are known, the so-called T-gels and the nitrilophoric matrices. Furthermore, thio-aromatic ma- trices having a hydrophobic nature are known.Prior
