TITLE: IMPROVED SEAL RING FOR ORIFICE PLATESPECIFi ATIQNBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention. The present invention relates to differential pressure flow instruments for determining the rate of flow of a fluid through a pipe and more specifically to orifice fittings.2. Description of the Prior Art. The predominant measurement in the process industry is flow rate. The need for accuracy in the measurement of fluid flow in the process industry is extremely important. A small error in the measurement of large quantities of a fluid through a pipe translates into a loss of income. Normally, wherever possible, flow rates are measured with a flat plate orifice which is installed in the pipe carrying the fluid. Oftentimes, the flat plate orifice is housed in an orifice flow meter called an orifice fitting as shown in Fig. 1. The flat plate orifice has a circular bore whose diameter is less than the diameter of the pipe in which it is installed. As Venturi discovered in the late 1700's, fluids gain speed and lose pressure when flowing through a converging section of pipe. Thus, as the fluid converges and accelerates to flow through the smaller bore, it loses pressure. The loss of pressure becomes the differential pressure used to measure the rate of flow.Many factors affect the accuracy of the readings and the determination of the rate of flow. Standards have been established and adopted by various 

 professional associations. The most popular basis for orifice flow meter design and installation and the accepted standard of orifice flow meter design and installation for the natural gas industry and the process industries in the United States and Canada is the American Gas Association (AGA) publication, Orifice Measurement of Natural Gas, Gas Measurement Committee Report No. 3. The American Petroleum Institute (API) incorporates the AGA publication in its Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards, Chapter 1 --Natural Gas Fluids Measurement. Among the many standards established in these publications is the maximum allowable orifice plate bore eccentricity Î£. The orifice plate bore must be concentric with both the upstream and downstream inside wall of the orifice plate holder, although the eccentricity with respect to the upstream side is the most-critical.Fig. 1 shows a typical orifice fitting, generally designated as F, representative of a class of orifice holders that is widely used throughout the industry. It is also noted that Fig. l also shows the present invention generally designated as

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS: 1. A seal ring for maintaining the radial position of a first plate in a second plate having a circular bore extending therethrough, the seal ring comprising: a flexible, pliant body having an inner periphery containing an annular recessed groove for receiving and sealingly engaging the first plate, and said body having an outer periphery which is received by the circular bore of the second plate; and a plurality of circumferentially spaced pins positioned in said body in a direction perpendicular to the first plate, wherein each said pin is substantially in direct contact with the first plate and the second plate for maintaining the radial position of the first plate in the second plate.
2. The seal ring according to claim 1, wherein each said pin is substantially tangent with said outer periphery of said body.
3. The seal ring according to claim 2, wherein each said pin is substantially tangent with said annular recessed groove of said body.
4. The seal ring according to claim 1, wherein each said pin has a length greater than the thickness of the first plate.
5. The seal ring according to claim 4, wherein each said pin contacts the entire thickness of the first plate and the entire length of each said pin contacts the second plate. 


 6. A seal ring for maintaining the radial position of an orifice plate in a carrier plate having a circular bore extending therethrough, the seal ring comprising: a flexible, pliant body having an inner periphery containing an annular recessed groove for receiving and sealingly engaging the outer periphery of the orifice plate, and said body having an outer periphery which is received by the circular bore of the carrier plate; a plurality of circumferentially spaced, cylindrical pins molded in said body in a direction perpendicular to the orifice plate, each said pin having a length greater than the thickness of the orifice plate and substantially tangential to said outer periphery of said body and substantially tangential to said annular recessed groove.
7. The seal ring according to claim 6, wherein each said pin contacts the entire thickness of the orifice plate and the entire length of each said pin contacts the carrier plate.
