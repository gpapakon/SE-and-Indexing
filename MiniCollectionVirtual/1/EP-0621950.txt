<ABSTRACT>
A sensor for optical detection of the moving parts (13) of a consumption meter (11) for visual indication of consumption has visual aiming means (16) assisting the correct mounting of the sensor with respect to the movable parts (13) of the meter. For use in connection with an electricity meter (11), which has a circular disc (13) with a visible mark (14) on its periphery, the aiming means (16) are designed so as to have an extent in two dimensions and so as to define a plane which is caused to coincide with the rotating disc (13) of the electricity meter (11) at the mounting of the sensor on the meter.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A SENSOR FOR OPTICAL DETECTION OF THE MOVABLE PART OF A CONSUMPTION METER FOR VISUAL INDICATION OF THE CONSUMPTION,The invention concerns a sensor for optical detection of the movable parts of a consumption meter for visual indi¬ cation of the consumption and comprising aiming means assisting the mounting of the sensor on the consumption meter.Electricity, water or gas meters traditionally have a mechanical counter for indication of accumulated consump¬ tion and moreover often a disc or a pointer rotating at a rate which is proportional to the size of the instan¬ taneous consumption. These movable parts, which indicate consumption, are visible from the outside and can be ob¬ served through a transparent plate of glass or the like, which forms part of the meter casing protecting against unauthorized manipulation with the meter. The known sensors have optically detecting elements and are adapted for external mounting on the meter in a manner such that the optically detecting elements "see" the consumption indicating parts of the meter, and when these parts move passed the "visual field" of the detecting parts, signals indicating such passage are formed on the electric output of these parts. This output signal can be applied to an electronic computing circuit which e.g. converts the re¬ ceived signals to accumulated consumption, performs sta¬ tistical calculations such as the distribution of the consumption over various periods of time, metered consump- tion converted to costs, ect. Such sensors allow external optical detection of the movable parts of a consumption meter without unauthorized manipulation with the meter.GB 2 179 399 describes a sensor of the present type, and where the aiming means are formed by an edge on a plate. 

 Consumption meters frequently have a metal casing, and their consumption indicating, rotating disc is thus posi¬ tioned partly in the dark so that just its periphery is visible. Aiming transversely to the edge is performed when mounting the sensor on the consumption meter, and the sen¬ sor is mounted so that the edge will be seen to coincide with the periphery of the rotating disc on the consumption meter. The aiming edge does not define any aiming plane, and aiming errors can therefore easily occur unless by chance the eye is in the plane of the rotating disc.When the known sensors are to be mounted on a consumption meter, it requires much care to have the sensor mounted correctly with respect to the parts whose movement the sensor is to detect, and frequently the user
