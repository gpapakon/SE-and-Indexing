<ABSTRACT>
A prepreg (3) for a sleeve member of fiber reinforced 
thermoplastic resin available for a tennis racket or a golf 

club is woven by using ribbon-shaped reinforcing fiber 
tows/uni-directional commingle yarns (1) and matrix fiber 

tows (2), and the ribbon-shaped reinforcing fiber 
tows/uni-directional commingle yarns make the prepreg and, 

accordingly, the sleeve product thin, light, highly dense, 
economical and large in mechanical strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a prepreg available for a 
fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin member and, more 
particularly, to a prepreg available for a tubular member 
of fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin such as, for 
example, a tennis racket and golf clubs. A product of fiber reinforced thermoplastic resin is 
fabricated through the following process. First, matrix 
fibers are made from a thermoplastic resin such as nylon or 
polycarbonate, and reinforcing fibers such as glass fibers 
or carbon fibers are mixed with the matrix fibers for 
producing a commingle yarn. The commingle yarns are woven 
into a cloth serving as a prepreg, and the reinforcing 
fibers of the warps cross the reinforcing fibers of the 
woofs in the prepreg. A prepreg is shaped into a predetermined 
configuration. Heat and pressure are applied to the 
prepreg in a mold, and melts the matrix fibers in the 
commingle yarn. While the heat is being applied, the 
melted thermoplastic resin is impregnated in the  
 
reinforcing fibers, and forms a matrix of thermoplastic 
resin. A high-fiber content product may be produced from 
the prepreg. The prepreg have found a wide variety of application, 
and a tennis racket and golf clubs are typical examples of 
the product made from the prepreg. If the product has a tubular configuration such as a 
racket frame and a club shaft, the matrix fibers and the 
reinforcing fibers are spun into commingle yarns, and the 
commingle yarns are braided into a sleeve member. The 
sleeve member is placed in a heated mold, and internal 
pressure is applied for forming a tubular member of fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin. However, if economical large tex carbon fiber such as 
12K tow is used for the commingle yarn, the sleeve member 
or the prepreg becomes very thick and heavy, because the 
economical large tex carbon fiber is fat and round in cross 
section. The fat fibers deteriorates the surface 
smoothness of the tubular member. In order to decrease the weight, the prepreg may be 
braided with sparse tows. The prior art tubular thus 
product made from the sparse prepreg is liable to have a 
matrix partially without reinforcing fibers, and  
 
undesirable void tends to take place. As a result, the 
tubular product suffers from insufficient mechanical 
strength. On the other hand, if carbon fiber tows with a small 
tex number such as the carbon fiber tows "3K" are used for 
the commingle yarn, the sleeve member is thin and light. 
However, the carbon fiber tows with the small tex number 
are so
