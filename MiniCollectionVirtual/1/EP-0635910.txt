<ABSTRACT>
A shielded electrical connector is disclosed for 
mating with a complementary electrical connector. The 

shielded connector includes a dielectric housing (12). A 
first region of the housing has a plurality of first 

terminals (58, 60) mounted therein in a first given array 
for interconnection with a plurality of first terminals of 

the complementary connector. A second region of the 
housing has a plurality of second terminals (64, 66) 

mounted therein in a second given array for interconnection 
with a plurality of second terminals of the complementary 

connector. An air gap (80) is provided in the dielectric 
housing (12) between the first and second arrays of 

terminals to form a barrier to reduce the capacitive 
coupling and crosstalk between the terminals in the first 

and second arrays thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a shielded electrical
connector according to the preamble of claim 1 and,
particularly, to a hybrid electrical connector for
accommodating both high frequency transmissions as well as
lower frequency transmissions.Electrical connectors are used to interconnect signal
transmission lines to printed circuit boards, other
electronic devices or to other complementary connectors. The
transmission lines transmit signals through a plurality of
conductors which, preferably, are physically separated and
electromagnetically isolated along their length.In the electronics industry, particularly the
computer industry, the predominant system embodies a
plurality of plug-in type connectors in mating engagement
with receptacle connectors on the computer, its main printed
circuit board or other electronic devices. The transmission
lines typically include coaxial electrical cables, either in
round or flat form, and round cables are presently being
used predominantly in relatively high frequency applications
between various system components.Classical coaxial designs derive their characteristic
impedance from the geometrical relationship between the
inner signal conductors and the outer shield member and the
intervening dielectric constant. For a given impedance,
signal conductor size and dielectric material, an overall 
outside dimension is defined. In order to increase signal
density and reduce the overall outside dimensions of a
transmission line connector system, alternate geometries
and/or dielectric materials are required.For data processing purposes, cables usually utilize
twisted pairs of conductors to achieve the necessary
characteristics, particularly impedance control and cross
talk control. Coaxial cables are frequently used in
singular, isolated, conductor configurations in high
frequency applications, such as to a high-speed, high-resolution
video monitor for the transmission of red, green
and blue video signals.Most often, the lower speed data transmission lines
are separated from the high speed signal transmission lines.
Consequently, different electrical connectors are often used
for the lower speed data transmission lines than for the
high speed signal lines. This adds to the problem of
requiring multiple connectors in ever-increasing
miniaturized and high density applications.A connector is known from US-A-5,046,960, which has
gaps between the signal terminals. The gaps include ground
terminals and serve to adjust the impedance of the connector
terminals. However, US-A-5,046,960

A shielded electrical connector (10) for mating with
another electrical connector along a mating axis, the

shielded connector including

a dielectric housing (12),
an outer conductive shield member (14) generally
surrounding a portion (22) of the housing for mating

with another electrical connector,
a plurality of first terminals (58, 60) in a first
given array (16) mounted in a first r
egion (34) of the
housing and being constructed for carrying lower speed

data for electrical connection with a plurality of first
terminals of another connector,
a plurality of second terminals (64, 66) in a second
given array (18) mounted in a second region (36) of the

housing and being constructed for carrying high speed
signals for interconnection with a plurality of second

terminals of another connector, said second array (18)
including a ground system (68, 70) therein,
the first given array (16) being spaced from the
second given array (18) of terminals,

characterized in that
an opening (80) being only filled with air is provided
in the dielectrical housing (12) between the first region (34)

and the second region (36) to define an air reservoir to
reduce the capacitive coupling and crosstalk between the

lower speed data terminals (58, 60) of the first array 
(16) and the high speed signal terminals (64, 66) of the

second array (18).

1, wherein said opening (80) comprises a slot extending

transversely between the two arrays (16, 18) of
terminals.

2, wherein said slot (80) is of a generally uniform

width and extends into the housing (12) from a mating
face (28) thereof.
The shielded electrical connector as set forth in any of
claims 1 to 3, wherein said dielectrical housing (12) is

generally elongated, and said outer conductive shield
member (14) includes a generally rectangular opening

positioned about said mating portion (22) of the housing
(12).
