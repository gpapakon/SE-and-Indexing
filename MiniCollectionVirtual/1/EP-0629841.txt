<ABSTRACT>
A navigation apparatus (100) is provided with: a 
measuring device (1, 2, 3, 4) for measuring a present position 

of a movable body to output a present position information; a 
storing device (DK) for storing map information; and a 

displaying device (13) having a display picture plane, for 
displaying various information. The apparatus is further 

provided with: a display controlling device (5) for 
controlling the displaying device to display a target position 

information, and the present position information on the map 
information; a judging device (5) for judging whether or not a 

distance between the present position and the target position 
is within a prede
termined value; and a calculating device (5) 
for calculating a middle position between the present position 

and the target position when the distance is within the 
predetermined value to output middle position information. 

The display controlling device controlling the displaying 
device to display the target position information and the 

present position information under a condition where a display 
position of the middle position information is located at a 

center of the display picture plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
navigation apparatus and a navigation method for a movable
body, and more particularly to a navigation apparatus and a
navigation method for a vehicle, which can display information
related to a target position and a present position.There are a navigation apparatus of so called self
sustaining type (i.e. built in type) and a navigation apparatus
of GPS (Global Positioning System) type using an artificial
satellite. The navigation apparatus of self sustaining type
is an apparatus for obtaining two dimensional displacement
data of the present position of the movable body by an earth
magnetism information from an earth magnetism sensor, an
azimuth data from an angular velocity sensor and a travelling
distance data from a travelling distance sensor, and for
integrating this two dimensional displacement data with
respect to a standard point so as to measure a new present
position of the movable body. The navigation apparatus of GPS
type is an apparatus for receiving electric waves form more
than two GPS satellites by a GPS receiver, and for calculating
the present position of the movable body at the receiving point 
by pseudo distance data, which includes the time offset of the
receiver between each GPS satellite and the receiving point,
and positional data of each GPS satellite.In the image display related to the navigation
apparatus of a vehicle etc., a present position of the movable
body, which indicates a travelling position of the movable body
obtained by the above mentioned various position measurement
data, and a target position, which indicates a target place set
by an operator beforehand, are displayed on a map. Especially,
when the travelling position of the movable body approaches the
target place, both of the above mentioned movable body position
and the target position, are simultaneously displayed on one
display picture plane.In the above explained case, when the movable body
position and the target position are displayed on one picture
plane, an image display is performed as shown in FIG. 4.In FIG. 4A, a position P, which indicates a movable
body position, a position Q, which indicates a target position,
and a position A, which is a center position of the display
image, are indicated on the display picture plane. Dref is a
distance of a reference radius expressed by dots (i.e. picture
elements). Since the image on the display picture plane is
formed by the set of dots, the dot can be used as a unit
replacing the distance on the display picture
