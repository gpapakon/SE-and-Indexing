<ABSTRACT>
A compliant mounting to attach a suction cup (11) to a support rod (10) is configured so that tilting movement of the cup occurs in such a way that translation of the mouth of the cup is minimised. The effective centre of the cup pivotal movement should lie within the confines of, or closely adjacent the cup. In the embodiment this is achieved by providing a sleeve (50) having an open lower end across which is stretched a resilient membrane (52). The membrane has a central aperture in which is secured the cup (11). Tilting movement of the cup occurring by subjecting the cup to a one-sided force A results in a complex pivotal cup motion by deformation of the membrane (52).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a suction cup assembly 
adapted to hold an article to permit the lifting 
thereof when suction is applied to the assembly. In 
particular - but not exclusively - this invention 
relates to such a suction cup assembly for use with 
produce, and especially mushrooms. This invention is in particular concerned with a 
suction cup assembly which comprises a suction cup 
having at one end thereof an open mouth for contacting 
an article, a support member and a coupling mounting 
the other end of the cup on to an end portion of the 
member. It is well-known to use a suction cup assembly of 
the kind just referred to, for the holding and lifting 
of an article by contacting that article with the 
suction cup assembly and applying suction (that is, a 
reduced pressure) thereto. The suction cup design 
depends to a large extent upon the nature of the 
article to be lifted; for example, in the case of a 
carton having a smooth and substantially impermeable 
outer surface, the suction cup may be relatively rigid 
and of a shallow axial depth. On the other hand, when 
handling delicate articles or articles of an irregular 
shape, it is more advantageous to use a relatively 
flexible suction cup of a greater axial depth, whereby 
the cup may deform as appropriate on contacting the 
article in order to achieve a good seal between the 
mouth of the cup and the article. It has been proposed to harvest mushrooms from 
their growing medium by contacting the top of the 
mushroom cap with a suction cup, applying suction 
thereto and then lifting the cap and its stalk clear of 
the growing medium, perhaps with a simultaneous 
twisting movement, as described in our British Patent  
 
Specification No. 2,237,491. Though such apparatus 
performs adequately when the stalks of the mushrooms 
are substantially erect and the caps are disposed 
generally horizontally, it is found that there is a 
tendency for the caps to be broken from their stalks on 
being contacted by the suction cup, in the event that 
upper surfaces of the caps are not disposed generally 
horizontally. Moreover, should the picking assembly 
not be properly centred over the cap as the cup is 
moved to contact the cap, one side of the suction cup 
will contact the cap before the other side of the cup. 
This unequal loading on the cup tends to tilt the cup 
sideways, resulting in an increased tendency for the 
cap to be broken from its stalk as the vacuum is 
applied during harvesting. It is known for example from DE-A-3036116 to mount 
a

<CLAIMS>
A suction cup assembly comprising a suction cup 
(11)having at one end (24) thereof an open mouth for 

contacting an article, the suction cup (11) being 
compressible in the axial direction thereof, a support 

member (10) and a coupling mounting the other end (23) 
of the cup on to an end portion of the member (10), the 

coupling being arranged to allow the cup to perform a 
generally pivotal movement with respect of the axis of 

the member, characterised in that the coupling includes 
means to control the effective centre (25) of said 

generally pivotal movement to lie within the confines 
of the cup (11) when the cup is at least partially 

compressed on one side (A). 
A suction cup assembly according to claim 1, 
wherein the effective centre (25) of said pivotal 

movement is arranged to lie substantially in the plane 
of the mouth of the suction cup (11). 
A suction cup assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2, wherein said coupling includes a sleeve (50) 

mounted on the end portion of the support member (10), 
a resilient membrane (52) extending over the end of the 

sleeve (50) remote from the support member (10) and 
said other end of the suction cup (11) being carried by 

the membrane (52) such that the cup may perform a 
generally pivotal movement with respect to the axis of 

the support member by resilient deformation of the 
membrane. 
A suction cup assembly according to claim 3, 
wherein the membrane (52) has a central aperture and 

the cup is mounted within said aperture. 
A suction cup assembly according to claim 3, 
wherein there is provided a skirt (58) for the suction 

cup (11), depending from said other end thereof towards 
the mouth end of the cup, the membrane (52) extending  

 
between the sleeve (50) and the free end of the skirt 

(58). 
A suction cup assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2, wherein said coupling comprises a first 

pivoted four-bar trapezium linkage having a pair of 
normally parallel unequal-length bars (13,14) the 

longer bar (13) of which is mounted on the support 
member (10), and a second pivoted four-bar trapezium 

linkage also having a pair of normally parallel 
unequal-length bars (16,17) the longer bar (16) of 

which is mounted on the shorter bar (14) of the first 
linkage and substantially at right angles thereto, the 

suction cup (11) being mounted on the shorter bar (17) 
of the second linkage and the projections of the equal-length 

bars (15,18) of the first and of the second 
linkages all normally substantially intersecting at a 

point (25), there being biassing means (21) to apply a 
resilient restorative force to the linkages tending to 

keep the unequal-length bars (13,14;16,17) of the two 
linkages substantially parallel, whereby the cup (11) 

may perform a generally pivotal movement with respect 
to the axis of the support member. 
A suction cup assembly as claimed in any of the 
preceding Claims, wherein the coupling includes means 

(61) biassing the cup (11) away from the support 
member. 
A suction cup assembly according to Claim 7, 
wherein the biassing means (61) comprises a ram (62,63) 

disposed between the support member (10) and the cup 
(11), which ram is adapted (65,67) to be connected to a 

low pressure source in such a way that the ram is 
expanded when low pressure is applied thereto. 
A suction cup assembly according to Claim 8, 
wherein a single low pressure source is connected to 

the ram and to the suction cup, by means of a  
 

common low pressure line (67) leading to the suction 
cup assembly. 
A suction cup assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2, wherein said coupling comprises a sleeve (41) 

mounted on the end portion of the support member (10), 
a collar (43) slidably and tiltably disposed within the 

sleeve (41) and a spring (45) biassing the collar (43)
