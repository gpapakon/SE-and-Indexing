<CLAIMS>
Contact (1) with a silver contact base (2) which is 
soldered onto a contact carrier (8) by means of a silver 

intermediate layer (4) and a solder (6), characterized 
in that the solder in the form of a platelet (6) is 

fastened to the silver intermediate layer (4) prior to 
the actual soldering operation. 
Contact according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the solder platelet (6) is located in an indentation of 

the silver intermediate layer (4) prior to the 
soldering. 
Contact according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the fastening has been performed by welding. 
Contact according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the fastening has been performed by ultrasonic welding. 
Contact according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the side of the silver layer facing towards the solder 

layer has small indentations. 
Contact according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the fastening has been performed by bonding. 
Process for producing a contact, in particular 
according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 

a silver intermediate layer (4) is pressed onto a silver 
contact base (2) and then a solder (6) in the form of a 

platelet is fastened to the silver intermediate layer 
(4) and then a contact carrier (8) is placed on the 

solder and soldered on.  
 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
the fastening of the solder platelet (6) is performed by 

welding. 
Process according to Claim 7 and 8, characterized in 
that the fastening of the solder platelet (6) is 

performed by ultrasonic welding to the silver 
intermediate layer (4). 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
the fastening of the solder platelet (6) is performed by 

bonding. 
Process according to one of Claims 7 to 9, 
characterized in that the solder platelet (6) is pressed 

onto the silver intermediate layer (4) during the 
ultrasonic welding via a pressure plate (10) having 

small dot-like protrusions (12). 
Process according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the dot-like protrusions (12) are conical in shape. 
Process according to Claim 11 or 12, characterized 
in that the ultrasonic vibrations of the pressure plate 

(10) are aligned at a tangent to the contact surface of 
the solder platelet
 (6). 
Process according to one of Claims 7 to 13, 
characterized in that the solder platelet (6) is pressed 

flush into the silver intermediate layer (4) prior to 
the soldering. 
Process according to one of Claims 7 to 14, 
characterized in that the contact carrier (8), the 

solder platelet (6), the silver intermediate layer (4) 
and the silver contact base (2) are inductively heated 

in the soldering operation.
