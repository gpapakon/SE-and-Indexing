<ABSTRACT>
An inductor having a spiral winding, embedded in insulating material, is proposed, at least one end face (9,10) of the inductor (1) being designed in such a way that the Joule heat produced in the winding (3,4,5) can be dissipated via the said end face, by means of thermal contact-making, to at least one liquid heat sink (18,19).

Clamping assembly for a converter with at least 
one power semiconductor (17), having at least one liquid 

heat sink (18, 19) and having at least one inductor (1), 
which is arranged inside the clamping assembly and is 

constructed in the form of a disc, the mechanical force 
required by thermal contacting being applied via stressing 

bars (15), at least one pressure plate (14) and at 
least one spring element (16), the inductor (1) having a 

spiral winding which is embedded in insulating material 
and comprises a rectangular flat conductor which - except 

at the centre - is continuously slotted, as a result of 
which the outgoing conductor (3), return conductor (4) 

and connection (5) between the outgoing conductor and 
return conductor are formed at the centre, the electric 

terminal connections (6, 7) of the winding penetrating 
the lateral surface (2) of the conductor (1), and the 

Joule heat produced in the winding (3, 4, 5) being 
dissipated to the at least one liquid heat sink (18, 19) 

via at least one end face (9, 10) of the inductor (1). 
Clamping assembly according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the at least one end face (9, 10) of the 

inductor (1) is free from insulated material in such a 
way that the metallic electric conductor (3, 4) of the 

winding is in direct thermal contact with the at least 
one liquid heat sink (18, 19). 
Clamping assembly according to Claim 1 and/or 2, 
characterized in that for the purpose of simulating a 

radio-frequency stranded wire, the metallic electric 
conductor (3, 4) of the winding is split into a plurality 

of parallel component conductors (11) which are separated 
from one another by insulating material (12) in each 

case.
