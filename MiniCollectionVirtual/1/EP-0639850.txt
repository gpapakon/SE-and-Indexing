<ABSTRACT>
An annulus (30) for use with a wafer (26) supporting 
pedestal (28) in a plasma or RIE etching tool is designed. 

Each annulus or 
collar is tailored of a selected insulating material to have a 

selected form, height, diameter, and thickness to alter the 
plasma sheath and hence the direction of the electric field 

lines at the pedestal edge to prevent or greatly reduce the 
existence of non-normal field lines at or near the wafer edge. 

By thus controlling with great particularity the direction of 
the ions being extracted from the plasma and used to perform 

the etch, heretofore unattainable etching symmetry can be 
achieved across the entire face of each wafer in the etching 

tool. 
By additionally introducing one or more gases in the region 
immediately adjacent the annulus the amount of etching of 

features in that region in the surface of the wafer mounted on 
the pedestal can be controlled. Thus, the slope of the walls 

of the etched features can be also controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plasma etching or Reactive Ion 
Etching ( RIE ) of semiconductor wafers. More particularly it 
relates to an improved plasma or RIE etching apparatus 
electrode structure and process for etching holes in 
semiconductor wafer surfaces. RIE and plasma etching techniques have been widely used for 
etching products such as semiconductor wafers. Basically such 
a technique comprises exposing the wafers to the plasma to 
remove, in selected regions, selected surface materials, such 
as silicon dioxide, carried on the semiconductor wafer 
surface. Polymeric materials, such as photoresist, are used 
as etch masks to prevent unwanted etching. Because the etch 
process determines if etching is done in a chemical or 
physical mode, etching of the selected materials can be very 
closely controlled. Although the etching tools presently used are greatly improved 
over those in the past, and the gas flow, pressure, and 
temperature as well as the gross electric fields, and plasma 
formation is more closely controlled than was possible in the 
past, asymmetrical etching may still occur during the process. RIE or plasma etching occurs because the ions doing the 
etching are extracted from the plasma by the electric field 
existing between the wafer, the pedestal and the plasma 
sheath, i.e., the edges of the plasma cloud. The ions 
extracted from the plasma follow the electric field lines to 
impact on and react with the selected exposed regions on the  
 
face of the wafer. Ideally these electric field lines should 
be normal to the surface of the wafer over its entire face. 
However, in apparatus used in the industry the edges of the 
wafer and pedestal, and the wafer hold down clips, used in 
some apparatus, each induce distortion or variations in the 
direction of the electrical field lines between the plasma 
sheath, the wafer, the pedestal and the clips. The angling of 
the wafer pedestals exacerbates electric field and plasma 
sheath distortion. Thus, the pedestal design can increase the 
non-normality of the electric fields at and near the edges of 
the wafer. Such electrical field variation causes the ions, 
drawn out of the plasma and effecting the etching, to interact 
with the wafer surface at acute or obtuse angles to the 
surface of the wafer. Any non-normal angle of incidence of 
the ions causes asymmetrical etching to occur in the wafer. 
Such asymmetrical etching is especially acute around the 
periphery of the wafer because of the high plasma sheath and 
electrical field line
