<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
biological synthesis of peptides modified by the 
genetic manipulation of the peptidic synthetases. In particular the present invention relates to the 
construction of engineered microorganisms capable of 
espress peptidic synthetases with a modified 
specificity of substrate. The present invention also relates to the use of 
said microorganisms and peptidic synthetases extracted 
from the above microorganisms by the in vivo or in 
vitro synthesis of biologically active modified 
peptides. The term " modified peptides" refers to analogues 
of wild type peptides or peptides having a new amino 
acid sequence. Peptidic synthetases are a group of both 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes involved in the 
synthesis of numerous peptides, by a non-ribosomal  
 
mechanism, also known as thiotemplate synthesis system 
(Kleinkauf, H. and von Doren, H., (1987), Ann. Rev. 
Microbiol., 41: 259-289). These peptides (of which several hundred are 
known) often have non-linear cyclic structures 
(cyclosporin, tyrocidin, mycobacillin, surfactin and 
others) or branched cyclic structures (polymyxin, 
bacitracin and others) and contain unusual amino acids 
not present in proteins and amino acids in D form. Peptidic synthetases are described as 
multienzymatic complexes consisting of one or more 
polypeptides (enzymatic subunits). The characteristic 
of these complexes is the presence on the same 
polypeptide of one or more repeated structural units 
(super-domains) inside of which there is an activation 
region (DDA), used for recognizing a specific amino 
acid. Each DDA catalyzes a series of enzymatic 
reactions, which eventually cause each amino acid to be 
included in the peptidic chain, and which include: 
1 - recognition of the amino acids 2 - activation of the amino acids as amino-acyladenylates 3 - binding of the activated amino acid to the enzyme 
by the thioester bond between the carboxylic group  
 
of the amino acid and the SH group of an enzymatic 
co-factor which is itself bound to the enzyme 
inside each DDA 4 - formation of the peptidic bonds among the amino 
acids. In addition, the DDA corresponding to amino acids 
in D configuration are coupled at the carboxylic end 
with regions associated with the racemization of the 
amino acids from configuration L to D. Finally, also connected with the multi-enzymatic 
complex are the termination and release functions of 
the peptide probably situated in a conserved domain 
after the last DDA, whose sequence has
