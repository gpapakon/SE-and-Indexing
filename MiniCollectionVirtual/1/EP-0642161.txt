<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor apparatus, a first circuit 
(3) provided on a major surface of a semiconductor 

substrate. The first circuit includes a plurality of 
logic circuits (51...5n) of an identical structure, the 

logic circuits having input terminals supplied with 
identical signals. First metal wiring (30) is provided 

on the semiconductor substrate in a direction identical 
to a direction of arrangement of the logic circuits, the 

first metal wiring being connected to one of the input 
terminals of each of the logic circuits. A second 

circuit (6) provided on the major surface of the semiconductor 
substrate in an outside area which does not 

overlap an area extending in a direction perpendicular 
to the direction of arrangement of the logic circuits, 

the second circuit supplying an identical signal to the 
input terminals of the logic circuits of the first 

circuit. A second metal wiring (40) is connected 
between an output terminal of the second circuit and a 

substantially middle point of the first metal wiring. 
The second metal wiring has a portion situated in parallel 

to the logic circuits. Thereby, an influence of 
wiring delay due to a difference in distances among the 

logic circuits can be reduced and a high-speed operation 
is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
apparatus capable of reducing to a minimum a wiring
delay of an input signal in an integrated circuit in
which a plurality of logic circuits are arranged in
the same direction, thereby achieving high-speed
operations.In semiconductor apparatus such as IC and LSI, a
plurality of logic circuits of the same structure are,
in most cases, arranged on a substrate in the same
direction.A general semiconductor memory apparatus such as an
SRAM comprises two parts: a part wherein a plurality of
logic circuits of the same structure, e.g. memory cell
arrays, row decoders/column decoders, section decoders
and section amplifiers, are arranged in the same direction
on the most area of a semiconductor substrate (i.e.
chip), and a part surrounding the chip, wherein address
buffers, control signal buffers and data input/output
(I/O) buffers are arranged.Normally, signals are transmitted among the logic
circuits via a single metal wiring layer or multiple
metal wiring layers formed on the chip.The metal wiring layers are arranged so that the
wiring area may reduce to a minimum in consideration of 
the influence on the chip size. In addition, the metal
wiring layers are arranged to have a minimum length in
consideration of the influence of parasitic capacitance
C and/or parasitic resistance R upon signals.FIG. 1 shows an example of a circuit constituting a
semiconductor memory. Specifically, FIG. 1 shows
arrangement of metal wiring for connecting an address
buffer 6, a row decoder 3 and a decoder control circuit
9. The number of address buffers 6 is equal to the number
(N) of addresses, and each address buffer 6 outputs
a signal A/A (A is a complimentary signal of signal A).
The decoder control circuit 9 outputs a control signal
EN for the decoder. In the row decoder 3, a 2N-number
of logic circuits (51, 52,...,5m) having (N+1) inputs
are arranged in the same direction, and input terminals
of each logic circuit are supplied with an address
signal A/A and a control signal EN.In these metal wirings, parasitic capacitance C
and parasitic resistance R are present as distributed
constants, and a delay of input signals occurs. Such
a delay of input signals further increases since an
input capacitance at each input terminal functions as a
load.The degree of propagation delay of the output A/A
increases as it reaches, or input to, a point farther
from the address buffer 6, i.e., in the order from a
point a at an output terminal of a driver provided
within the buffer 6, a point b at
