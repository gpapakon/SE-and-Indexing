<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for coking scrap tyre granules, particularly for the production of an active filter material. For technological improvement of the process, the volatile hydrocarbon compounds and sulphur are expelled from the granules in a first stage (1) at 200 to 300@C in a nitrogen atmosphere and the granules thus pretreated are coked in a second stage (II) in a preheated countercurrent of nitrogen gas.

<CLAIMS>
A process for coking scraptire granules particularly for
the production of an active filtering material, characterised

by that in a first step (I) the volatile hydrocarbon compositions
and sulphur are driven out from the granule in a nitrogen

atmosphere at 200°C to 300°C, and that the thus pretreated
granule is coked in a second step (II) in a pre-heated

nitrogen gas counter-flow.
A process according to claim 1, characterised by that
the first step (I) is executed in a revolving tubular furnace

(3), and the second step (II) in double tubular furnaces (14,
37, 38) continuously passed by the granule and disposed one

behind the other.
A process according to claim 2, characterised by that
the hydrocarbon compositions driven out from the granule in

the first step (I) and the sulphur are fed to a cascade
cleaner (4).
A device for carrying out the process according to one
of claims 1 to 3, characterised by that double tubular furnace

(14, 37, 18) is formed of a rotatable vertical internal tube
(15) with a rotatable conveyer worm (16) arranged therein, and

comb-type drive portions (20) disposed on the outside wall,
and an external shell tube (19) having internal slotted bottoms

(17), between which the comb-type drive portions (20) are
disposed, and an annular widened portion (26) of a horizontal

exhaust gas duct (27), said portion (26) being welded to external
shell tube (19), filled by a helical stainless steel

bottom (34, 25, 36) and provided with temperature-controlled
heating rods (28) in ceramic protection sleeves (29).
A device according to claim 4, characterised by that in
the upper part of double tubular furnaces (14, 37, 38) screen

plates (31) for exhaust gas conduction are disposed.
A device according to claim 4, characterised by that upstream
to first double tubular furnace (14) a revolving tubular 

furnace (3) connected by a conveyer worm (13) to internal
tube (15), and downstream thereto another double tubular furnace

(37, 38) connected by an outlet (23) of the external
shell tube (19) are provided.
