<ABSTRACT>
The belt body (10) of a V-belt or ribbed V-belt includes 
a longitudinal reinforcing inlet (14) embedded 

therein. In the longitudinal direction of the 
belt, this reinforcing inlet (14) has an elastic 

modulus of less than 3,000 N/mm but more than 1,500 
N/mm. Due to the relatively low elastic modulus, the 

internal heat development of the belt is reduced 
without a considerable decrease of the power 

transmission capacity. Because of the low heat generation 
in case of vibrational changes of the rotational 

angle of the pulleys, the operational life of 
the belt is extended.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to an endless V-belt or 
ribbed V-belt. V-belts and ribbed V-belts serve for the transmission 
of peripheral forces in drive systems. These 
belts comprise a reinforcing inlet of pulling cords 
which is embedded into an elastomeric belt body. The 
frictional engagement between the belt surface and 
the drive disks is generated by the surface of the 
belt body, the power transmission being performed by 
the reinforcing inlet. Conventional standard V-belts 
or ribbed V-belts are provided with a reinforcing 
inlet of highly resistant pulling cords for allowing 
transmission of high peripheral forces. The caoutchouc 
compounds used for the belt body are suited 
to the large forces to be transmitted. The increased 
requirements on the operational safety of belt drives 
have led to an increased demand for disturbance-free 
V-belts and ribbed V-belts having a long lifespan. 
In known V-belts or ribbed V-belts, the elastic 
modulus, relative to the belt width, of the reinforcing 
inlet is above 5,000 N/mm. In the state of 
the art, it is a basic assumption that a belt with a 
high power transmission capacity, for obtaining a 
high transmission performance and a long lifespan,  
 
must have a high elastic modulus of more than 5,000 
N/mm, which makes the belt relatively stiff and 
hardly stretchable. An endless elastic V-belt or ribbed V-belt known 
from DE 40 38 465 Al can be used as a snap-on belt, 
i.e. this belt has a large elasticity so as to be 
stretchable for mounting on pulleys. This known belt 
has an elastic modulus, relative to the belt width, 
ranging between 250 N/mm and 1,500 N/mm. It is an object of the invention to provide a belt 
which is capable of taking up high dynamic stresses 
and transmitting large forces while having an improved 
slippage and noise behaviour and a long lifespan. According to the invention, the above object is solved 
by the features indicated in claim 1. The invention is based on the recognition that operational 
failure of a belt primarily occurs due to 
heat-induced aging of the caoutchouc material and 
the resultant embrittlement. The heat-induced aging 
is mainly caused by vibrational changes of the rotational 
angle which the belt is subjected to when 
running around the pulleys. Such vibrational changes 
result in slippage and accompanying noise. Surprisingly, 
it has been observed that the above vibrational 
changes of the rotational angle in the belt 
drive generate heat. The degree of this heat increases 
with an increasing elastic
