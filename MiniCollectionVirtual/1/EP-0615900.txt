<ABSTRACT>
A split cylinder compliant tube baffle (22) for absorbing 
and/or cancelling noise signals generated within a submarine or 

surface ship includes an air-filled tube (23) having a longitudinal 
gap (24) extending the length of the tube (23). A rubber jacket 

(26) encloses the gap (24) and end covers (28) seal end portions of 
the tube (22). A split tube baffle assembly is generally 

constructed of such tube baffles (22) adjacently aligned to form a 
panel. Such panels can then be stacked for increased attenuation of 

acoustic signals. The split cylinder baffle (22) offers significant 
size reduction and improved performance over conventional compliant 

tube baffle designs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a baffle assembly comprising a 
panel of compliant tube baffles aligned adjacently to one another, 
each baffle comprising a hollow tube, and the assembly including 
means closing the tubes. In a sonar system, it is generally desired to increase the 
overall response of the sonar system to a desired signal by 
decreasing the response of the system to undesired acoustic 
signals, generally referred to as noise. In sonar systems, sonar 
baffles are typically used to isolate highly sensitive acoustic 
receivers from the undesired acoustic signals. In general, sonar baffles are energy cancelling or energy 
absorbing devices in which undesired acoustic signals are reduced 
by such mechanisms as shear and/or torsion absorption or 
cancellation of the signals by the generation of equal signals 
that are out of phase with respect to signals received by the 
baffle. In many applications, a passive sonar receiving system, 
such as a hydrophone array, is located on a moving vessel for 
detecting acoustic signals propagating in the ocean. Noise 
generated on or by the moving vessel, such as machinery noise, 
hydrodynamic noise, and the noise produced by the activities of 
the vessel's crew is typically called "self noise" and can mask a 
desired signal received by the hydrophone array. Moving vessels 
such as submarines and ships have hulls generally constructed of 
large metal plates mounted to bulkheads. The metal plates are 
easily excited into flexural vibration by the on-board machinery 
and hydrodynamic noise and act as an acoustic radiator to the 
ocean medium. A sonar baffle assembly may be placed between a 
highly sensitive hydrophone array and the hull of a ship or 
submarine. The baffle assembly minimizes the acoustic energy 
propagating from the hull structure by absorbing the acoustic  
 
energy within the sonar baffles and/or by reflecting the acoustic 
energy back to the hull. Some of the sources of radiated noise of a moving vessel 
produce a line-component spectrum in which the noise is dominated 
by tonal components at a fundamental frequency and related 
harmonics of the vibration producing process. Other sources of 
radiated noise produce a generally continuous spectrum related to 
the excitation of structural members, such as the hull, into 
resonance. This type of noise, sometimes called high wavenumber 
noise, does not generate propagating acoustic waves and is 
referred to as evanescent in nature. Accordingly, while this 
slow-wave, non-propagating noise is unlikely
