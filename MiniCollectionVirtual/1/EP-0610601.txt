<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing polymers based on carbon monoxide and 
olefins. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to a process for preparing copolymers and terpolymers 
of carbon monoxide, ethylene and, optionally, at least 
one hydrocarbon containing an unsaturation of alkenyl 
type. By means of the expression "hydrocarbon containing 
an unsaturation of alkenyl type", as used in the 
instant disclosure and in the attended claims, such 
olefins, as propylene, butene, styrene, norbornene, and 
so forth, are meant. Polymers based on carbon monoxide and olefins, or 
polyketones, are known in technical literature and are 
described, for example, in Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of 
Chemical Technology, Second Edition, Vol. 12, page 132, 
1967. More particularly, polymers based on carbon 
monoxide and ethylene, having a high molecular weight, 
and in which the -CO-(C2H4)- unit is repeated in 
alternate sequence, can be prepared in the presence of 
a catalytic system constituted by a palladium compound, 
a phosphorus or nitrogen containing bidentate chelating 
agent, an anion of a non-hydrohalic acid with a pKa 
lower than 4 and an organic oxidizer agent. In U.S. patent 4,786,714, a process is disclosed 
for preparing polymers of carbon monoxide and olefins,  
 
in particular ethylene, carried out in the presence of 
a catalytic composition constituted by: 
(1) a compound of a metal of the VIII Group selected 
from palladium, cobalt and nickel; (2) an anion of a non-hydrohalic acid having a pKa 
lower than 6; (3) a nitrogen containing bidentate chelating agent 
having the general formula: 
 
wherein X and Y represent bridging groups containing 
either 3 or 4 atoms in the bridge moiety, at least two 
of which are carbon atoms. The catalytic system known from the prior art are 
characterized by the presence of the acidic cocatalyst 
which, besides creating problems of technological 
character, such as, e.g., corrosion of the autoclaves, 
tends to get embedded inside the polymer, worsening the 
properties thereof. The present Applicant has found now a catalytic 
system for preparing polymers based on carbon monoxide 
and olefins which was never described before in 
technical literature in connection with this function, 
and makes it possible the drawbacks to be overcome, 
which are associated with the presence of the acidic 
cocatalysts known from the prior art. Therefore, the subject-matter of the present 
invention is a process for preparing straight, 
alternate polymers
