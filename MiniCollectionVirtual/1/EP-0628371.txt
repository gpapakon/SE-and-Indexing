<ABSTRACT>
A field of application of manually actuable spot-welding guns is the welding together of sheets in vehicle body building. The welding electrodes (18, 19) are to bear with a minimum pressure against the sheets to be joined. To this end, a movement of the welding electrodes towards one another is necessary. Accordingly, the distance between the electrodes must be variable. According to the invention, provision is made for a welding plane (20) lying between the welding electrodes (18, 19) to run approximately perpendicularly to the main extension direction of the electrode holders (12, 13) or to the housing. In addition, one electrode holder (12) can be moved (manually) in its longitudinal direction in the gun housing (11) against a spring pressure and approximately perpendicularly to the welding plane (20).
