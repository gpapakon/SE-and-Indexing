<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for radio
communication as stated in the first part of claim 1.Up to now the connections to the overwhelming majority of
public telephone subscribers, also to residences, offices,
is made by wiring. This means that even if the network
implements radio technology, e.g. by satellite, the last
part of the network mostly uses wiring, i.e. most local
connections are in the form of wires. However, the
installation of wired connections especially for the local
loop e.g. residences, offices, e t c is both time consuming
and involves substantial networking costs. Therefore there
is an increasing interest in exploring the potential of
radio technology as an alternative for wiring in the local
loop. This is among others of general interest for new
second and third public network operators since it provides
fast installation and can provide local mobility as an
advantage. For a first dominant operator it is of interest
at least for niche markets. Another problem, however not
general but merely relevant to some countries, is that the
regulations in these particular countries for public
telephone operators prevent them from offering mobility in
the PSTN/ISDN (Public Switched Telephone Network/Integrated
Services Digital Network). Some attempts have been done to use radio link connections
to the subscriber. The concept itself is called Radio in
the Local Loop, or in short form RLL. The traditional,
wired, connection, will in the following be called Wired
Local Loop, WLL. Fig. 1 shows a simplified illustration of
Wired Local Loops, WLL- and Radio Local Loops, RLL-connections
with public subscribers, residences as well as
offices. BS Stands for Base Station.As to the concept of the Radio in the Local Loop, RLL, this
can be divided into two basic concepts, namely the so
called Fixed Radio in the Local Loop, FRLL, and the Mobile
Radio in the Local Loop, MRLL. These two concepts are
illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively.In Fig. 2 the Fixed Radio in the Local Loop concept is
illustrated. In this case the subscriber has one or more
telephones sockets 6' to which his telephone or telephones
4' are connected. In this case there is not really a
difference for the subscriber from having a Wired Local
Loop since he does not see any difference. The telephones
4' are connected to the telephone sockets 6' which are
connected to a so called Subscriber Fixed Station, SFS, 2',
which is connected to an antenna 7', e.g. arranged on the
roof of a building or similar via which is
