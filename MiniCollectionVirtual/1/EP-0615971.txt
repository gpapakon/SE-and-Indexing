<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel benzothiazepine derivatives. The 
invention relates in particular to 5-( 
piperazinylalkyl)benzothiazepine derivatives useful as Ca-antagonists as well as 
coronary vasodilators. EP-A-0 433 683 discloses the use of benzothiazepines as potentiators of 
anti-cancer drugs which involve a piperidino-alkyl group; in contrast the invention 
of the present application is concerned with benzothiazepinones N-substituted by 
an optionally substituted benzhydryl-piperazinyl-alkyl group. Furthermore, EP-A-0 
429 060 is concerned with the preparation of benzothiazepines which are 
useful as intermediates or as pharmaceuticals and compounds of the general 
nature disclosed in this prior specification may have a variety of medicinal 
applications. USP 3 562 257 discloses benzothiazepine derivatives useful as coronary 
vasodilator. Although other benzothiazepine derivates, such as diltiazem 
derivatives, are disclosed in USP 4 584 131 and Japanese Patent Publication (not 
examined) No.292271/1989, a particular group of benzothiazepine derivatives, i.e. 
5-(piperazinyl-alkyl) 
benzothiazepines of the present invention, which are useful as coronary 
vasodilator and also Ca-antagonist, i.e. cardiac muscle protector, have not been 
reported. It is well known that contraction of cardiac muscle or vascular smooth 
muscle is associated with Ca-penetration into cells. Thus, the administration of 
Ca-antagonist to patients results in suppression of cardiac contraction and 
coronary vasodilation, and therefore a Ca-antagonist is useful as a therapeutical 
agent for cardiac diseases such as angina pectoris, cardiac infarction, and 
arrhythmia, hypertension and cerebrovascular contracture. Diltiazem is extensively used for treatment of angina pectoris and essential 
hypertension, but has a drawback that suppression of cardiac contraction caused 
by dilthiazem is too drastic. Accordingly, a new medicine free from such 
drawback has long been desired.  
 The present inventors have disclosed in the parent application 
No.92309474.2 (publication No.0 541 263) that a benzothiazepine derivative of 
the formula: 
 
wherein X is =N-A-R1 or =C(R1)R2; A is a single bond, 
polymethylene or -CO-; R1 and R2 are each hydrogen, C1-C6 
alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyl, unsubstituted or substituted 
phenyl, optionally substituted benzhydryl, or optionally 
substituted 5 to 6 membered heterocyclic group; Y is 
hydrogen, halogen, C1-C6 alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyl, C1-C6 
alkoxy, optionally substituted phenoxy, optionally
