<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pressureless sintering process for forming whisker-reinforced 
alumina-based ceramic bodies having excellent physical properties. Whisker-reinforced alumina has found use in structural applications such as heat 
engines and turbine blades (see, U.S. Patent No. 4,543,345) and in more severe 
applications such as cutting tools (see, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,789,277 and 4,961,757). These 
composites can have up to about 40 vol. % whiskers using a processing technique known 
as "hot pressing" which produces composites having a density of at least greater than 98% 
of theoretical. A density of at least about 95% is needed for virtually all engineering 
applications of ceramics. In the conventional processes for making whisker-reinforced alumina bodies, hot 
pressing can also be described as "pressurized sintering" because the process involves the 
application of uniaxial loads of about 24,1 - 37,9 MPa (3500-5500 psi). In the process, a powder blend or 
preformed sample is loaded in a free flowing form into a graphite die and sintered under 
an inert atmosphere in a high temperature furnace. Pressure is applied to the powder in 
the die with a hydraulic ram as the furnace temperature is increased to about 1450°-1850° 
C and maintained at temperature for an appropriate time. The furnace is then allowed to 
cool. Cycle times of several hours are used, and the process is limited to the production 
of discrete batches. The structural limits of the dies generally prohibit the use of applied pressures 
greater than about 37,9 MPa (5500 psi). In addition, the hot pressing method generally limits the shape 
of the formed body to simple geometric shapes such as round or rectangular plates or  
 
cylinders unless special complex dies and pressure rams are constructed at great expense. 
In addition, the properties of such hot pressed bodies are more anisotropic due to the 
uniaxial loading than those prepared by the pressureless sintering. Hot pressing is to be contrasted with "green" preform body preparation, 
"pressureless sintering" and "hot isostatic pressing" (HIPing). Green preform bodies are 
prepared by mixing ceramic powder blends with conventional sintering aids (e.g., magnesia 
and/or rare earth oxides) and an organic binder containing a lubricant. The green preform 
body is then formed by compacting the powder blend at ambient temperature to a density 
of about 60-70% of theoretical. The theoretical density of a material is the density 
calculated from the number of atoms per unit cell
