<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the design, construction 
and use of lined or coated corrugated paperboard 
package systems (e.g. boxes, cartons) for prolonging the 
storage life of fresh fruits and vegetables under modified 
atmospheres (MA) in the headspaces of the closed package 
systems. The fresh packed quality attributes of fresh 
fruits and vegetables must be maintained as much as possible 
for as long as possible to ensure consumer acceptability. 
Quality deterioration of horticultural produce comes 
about through plant tissue enzyme reactions including 
respiration, ripening and senescence, through microbial 
growth and through water loss for the tissue. Methods of 
inhibiting the deteriorative enzyme reactions, and the 
growth of yeasts, molds and bacteria involve the reduction 
of the produce temperature to between 1 and 12°C, and the 
creation of low O2/high CO2 modified atmospheres around the 
produce. Water in fruits and vegetables can be lost 
readily under low relative humidity conditions with the 
consequence of skin wrinkling, wilting and reduction in 
crispness. The rate of water loss from produce can be 
restricted by storing the produce in closed package systems 
consisting of walls with low moisture permeability. GB-A-2 096 052, Lin Pac Containers Limited, 
discloses corrugated board which is designed principally 
for water resistance. There is no disclosure in the 
specification that is directed to regulating gas transmission 
rates through the board. However, the construction 
of the corrugated board is relevant. The corrugated board 
is constructed of two outer facer layers which are laminates 
comprising a first layer and a second layer, with a  
 
plastic intermediate layer. The centre of the board is 
corrugated kraft fluting. The first outermost layer can 
be greaseproof paper. The intermediate plastics layer can 
be polyethylene. GB-A-1 592 880, Unilever Limited, discloses a 
moisture resistant composite material comprising cardboard, 
paperboard, or similar foldable board material. The 
objective is to provide a moisture resistant composite 
material useful for constructing cartons for packaging 
moisture sensitive materials. The composite material 
comprises a first layer of board material to form a facing 
layer, a second layer of kraft paper which is corrugated 
and attached to the first layer and a third layer of board 
material which is attached to the second layer. The third 
layer can be a laminate of two sheets of board material 
(kraft) with a thermoplastic moisture
