<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing a solid, polymeric electrolyte, to said 
solid, polymeric electrolyte and to its use in 
electrochemical devices which contain it. The solid, polymeric electrolytes consist of a 
solid solution of an ionic compound in a solid 
polymeric matrix deriving from the polymerization of 
monomers containing a heteroatom, preferably oxygen. The most widely diffused solid polymeric 
electrolytes are those based on a polyethylene oxide, 
or on another polyether, such as, for example, those as 
disclosed in U.S. 4,471,037; FR 2,523,769; 
FR 2,568,574; and EP 13,199. Such materials display interesting values of ionic 
conductivity only at relatively high temperatures, at 
which they unfortunately display a low mechanical 
strength: they are consequently not really interesting 
for such practical uses as electrolytic separators in 
electrochemical devices, optical and electrochromic 
display and in sensors. In U.S. Patent No. 5,173,205 and 
IT 1,222,929 particular polymeric polyvinyl ether-based 
electrolytes are disclosed which display both an 
improved mechanical strength and a satisfactory 
conductivity even at relatively low temperatures. Preparing such materials requires complex 
multistep processes comprising the copolymerization of 
suitable vinyl ethers at a temperature of the order of  
 
-75/-80°C for a time comprised within the range of from 
30 to 60 minutes, dissolving the resulting solid, 
crosslinked polyvinyl ether in a suitable solvent, 
blending said solution with a solution containing an 
ionic compound and evaporating the solvent in order to 
obtain a membrane. In U.S. Patent No. 5,173,205, , the 
suitably functionalized polyvinyl ether is crosslinked 
by means of a diprotic crosslinker agent during the 
step of polymer blending with the ionic compound. This 
step is followed by solvent evaporation in order to 
obtain the membrane. We have found now a process for preparing solid, 
polymeric electrolytes based on polyvinyl ethers, which 
process does not require the just described complex 
multi-step processes. Such a process consists in polymerizing and 
crosslinking suitable vinyl ethers in an organic 
solvent, directly in the presence of an ionic compound 
and possibly in the presence of an oligomer or of a 
dipolar aprotic liquid. The solid, polymeric electrolytes obtained 
according to the process of the present invention in 
the presence of a dipolar liquid supply improved 
performance over the polivinyl ethers known from the 
prior
