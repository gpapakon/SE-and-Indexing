<ABSTRACT>
An exposure station comprises an illumination device (2), arranged above a transport level (T) for a copy master (N), with a lamp (3) as the copy light source (copier light source) and a light well (5) arranged in the beam path (L) of the lamp (3) between the lamp (3) and the copy master (N), and a projection optics (optical projection system) (9), arranged between the transport level (T) of the copy master (N) and a transport level (S) of copy material (P), for imaging the copy master (N) onto the copy material (P). Different magnification ratios can be set by adjusting the projection optics (9), for example by selecting different objectives. On the light outlet side of the light well (5), means (8) are provided for matching the luminance conditions of the copy light (L) on the copy master (N) to the respectively set magnification ratio.

Exposure system for a photographic copier, comprising a lighting installation (2) disposed
above a transport level (T) for an original (N) with a lamp (3) as a light source for copying,

and, disposed between the transport level (T) of the original (N) and a transport level (S) of
the copying material (P), a projection optical system (9) for forming the image of the

original (N) on the copying material (P) and for the setting of different degrees of
enlargement, the exposure system having a set of at least two light shafts (5) which can be

disposed between the lamp (3) and the original (N) in the path of the beam (L) of the lamp
(3), and which each have a ground glass screen (8) on the light emission side, the light

shafts differing from one another in that the transmission characteristics of the respective
ground glass screen (8) are variably distributed over its surface, so that by selecting a light

shaft from the set of light shafts it is possible to adjust the light intensity of the copying light
(L) falling on the original (N) to the degree of enlargement selected.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the ground glass screen (8) on at least
one of the light shafts (5) diffuses the copying light incident upon it substantially in

accordance with Lambert's Law, and its transmission characteristics through the ground
glass screen (8) can be influenced corresponding to the respective degree of enlargement.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the form of the light shaft (5) is so
chosen that the original (N) is completely illuminated, that preferred directions of the

incident copying light (L) are prevented, and that the light intensity of the incident light (L)
is as high as possible for a given light output in the centre (81) of the ground glass screen

and increases from the centre (81) to the edge (82) ofthe illuminated area (B) ofthe ground
glass screen (8), where it is approximately 25% higher than in the centre (81).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the ground glass screen (8) on the light
emission side displays homogeneous transmission over its surface, which can be influenced

in such a way that transmission decreases starting from an unchanged central area (81)
moving radially outwards to the edge of the illuminated area (B) of the ground glass screen

(8), where transmission amounts for instance to approximately 85% of the transmission in
the central area (81) of the ground glass screen. 
Device according to one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that the ground glass
screen has a preferably black dot grid (83) with a dot size variable from one area to another.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in that the relation of the dot size of the grid
(83) to its position is so chosen that with a minimum degree of enlargement a marginal

deterioration of the copying light (L) of 5% occurs.
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in that the dot grid (83) on the light emission

side of the light shaft (5) can be swung into the path of the beam of the copying light (L).
Device according to one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the set of light shafts
comprises at least one first light shaft, whose ground glass screen (8) on the emission side

displays homogeneous transmission over its surface, and at least one second light shaft
constructed in the same manner, whose ground glass screen (8) on the emission side

displays a transmission decreasing radially from the centre (81) to the edge (82) of the
illuminated area (B) of the ground glass screen (8), which transmission amounts to

approximately 100% in the central area (81) of the ground glass screen (8) and in the
marginal area (82) for instance to approximately 85% of the transmission of the ground

glass screen (8) on the light emission side of the first light shaft.
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in that the ground glass screen (8) on the light
emission side of the second light shaft is provided with a preferably black dot grid (83) with

a dot size variable from one area to another.
Device according to Claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the dot grid (83) is imprinted on the
side facing the lamp (3) of the ground glass screen (8) on the light emission side in a grid

with approximately 2mm gaps, using silk-screen printing.
Device according to one of the Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the ground glass screen
(8) on the light emission side comprises a plate of polymethylmethacrylate (Plexiglas)

having a thickness of at least approximately 2 to 4mm, preferably approximately 3mm,
which has a diffusion capacity of approximately 0.57 and a transmission factor of at least

approximately 44%. 
Device according to one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that each light shaft (5)
comprises a housing (6) which is an injection moulding, whose inner walls facing one

another are vapour-blasted with aluminium and possibly silicon dioxide to give a reflective
surface or coated with some other reflective material.
Photographic copier for copying photographic originals (N) onto photographic copying
material (P), comprising an exposure unit (1) with a lighting installation (2) according to

one of the Claims 1-12.
