<ABSTRACT>
The method of contactless measuring the surface temperature and/or the 
emissivity of objects on the principle of scanning the infrared radiation coming 

out of the measured object (1) by means of, at least, two infrared radiation 
detectors (3,5). The particular infrared radiation detectors (3,5) are maintained 

at the different mean temperatures (T₁, T₂) by the supply of heat, while the 
different and independent output signals (U₁, U₂) of these detectors are 

obtained for the determination of surface temperature (T
o
) and/or the emissivity 
of measurd object (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention deals with contactless measuring the surface temperature
and/or the emissivity of objects based on scanning the infrared radiation emitted
by an object being measured by means of at least two detectors of infrared
radiation.Contactless measuring the temperature of, especially, moving objects is
a frequent requirement, for example, of many processes in the textile, paper
and pulp, and plastic industries. Without solving this problem it is impossible to
control, regulate and optimize many of these processes. Contactless
convention thermometers or radiation thermometers are often used for this
purpose.The former of these thermometers are cheaper, however, they must be
installed in the close vicinity of the object being measured, which is not always
possible.Radiation thermometers, i.e. pyrometers, based on scanning the infrared
radiation coming out of the object are substantially dependent on the emissive
properties, i.e. on the radiation ability or the degree of the measured object
blackness. In addition, the error in measurement is increased by the absorption 
of infrared radiation in the space between the measured object and the
pyrometer containing an infrared radiation detector.The error in measurement caused either by ignorance or the variability of
object emissivity and infrared radiation absorption is decreased with the
application of so-called two-band or multiband pyrometers. With these devices
the infrared radiation coming out of the object is divided into bands of
different wavelengths by means of optical filters.At the same time, the detectors which are maintained at identical
temperatures are scanning the radiation only in the selected bands. In this way,
a set of independent signals is being created which makes it possible, under
certain conditions, to eliminate the influence of the emissivity of the measured
object in the resulting relation for the calculation of the measured object
temperature.The main prerequisites of this application are the independence of the
emissivity of the measured object on its temperature, or the coincidental
increase of the object spectral emissivity with temperature which belong to the
given conditions. Similarly, the absorption of infrared radiation in the
atmosphere must also be identical in all measured bands of the infrared
spectrum.In practice, these requirements are almost incapable of being fulfilled at
lower measured temperatures. Therefore, the band pyrometers are exclusively
applied at higher temperatures. However, even in this case
