<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for separating a first layer of tissue, such as the peritoneum, from a second layer of tissue, such as the properitoneal fascia. The apparatus includes a main envelope that defines a main inflatable chamber (113). The apparatus also includes an introducing device (160) that introduces the main envelope in a collapsed state between the first layer of tissue and the second layer of tissue. The introducing device also inflates the main envelope into an expanded state to separate the first layer of tissue from the second layer of tissue, and to create a working space between the two layers of tissue. Finally, the apparatus includes an insufflating device (125, 131) that introduces insufflation gas into the working space between the two layers of tissue. A method for separating a first layer of tissue from a second layer of tissue provides a main envelope and insufflation gas. The main envelope defines a main inflatable chamber. The main envelope is introduced in a collapsed state between the first layer of tissue and the second layer of tissue. The main envelope is inflated into an expanded state to separate the first layer of tissue from the second layer of tissue, and to create a working space between the two layers of tissue. Insufflation gas is then introduced into the working space between the layers of tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inflatable retraction devices of use in laparoscopic 
surgery for separating layers of tissue, 
particularly in procedures for repairing hernias. A hernia is the protrusion of part of a body part or structure through a 
defect in the wall of a surrounding structure. Most commonly, a hernia is the 
protrusion of part of abdominal contents, including bowel, through a tear or 
weakness in the abdominal wall, or through the inguinal canal into the scrotum. An abdominal hernia is repaired by suturing or stapling a mesh patch over 
the site of the tear or weakness. The mesh patch has a rough surface that can 
irritate the bowel and cause adhesions. It is therefore preferred to install the 
patch properitoneally. The mesh patch is preferably attached to the properitoneal 
fascia of the abdominal wall, and covered by the peritoneum. To attach the mesh 
patch to the properitoneal fascia, the peritoneum must be dissected from the 
properitoneal fascia. This is a difficult process. There is a risk of puncturing the 
peritoneum. Moreover, strands of properitoneal fat interconnecting the 
peritoneum and the properitoneal fascia make it difficult to see the site of the 
hernia. The use of laparoscopic techniques to perform hernia repair is becoming 
increasingly common. In the conventional procedure for carrying out a hernia 
repair laparoscopically, an endoscope and instruments are introduced into the 
belly through one or more incisions in the abdominal wall, and are advanced 
through the belly to the site of the hernia. Then, working from inside the belly,  
 
a long incision is made in the peritoneum covering the site of the hernia. Part 
of the peritoneum is dissected from the properitoneal fat layer to provide access 
to the fat layer. This is conventionally done by blunt dissection, such as by 
sweeping a rigid probe under the peritoneum. In this procedure, it is difficult to 
dissect the peritoneum cleanly since patchy layers of properitoneal fat tend to 
adhere to the peritoneum. In an alternative known laparoscopic hernia repair procedure, the belly is 
insufflated. An incision is made in the abdominal wall close to the site of the 
hernia. The incision is made through the abdominal wall as far as the 
properitoneal fat layer. The peritoneum is then blunt dissected from the 
properitoneal fat layer by passing a finger or a rigid probe through the incision 
and sweeping the finger or rigid probe under the peritoneum. After the 
peritoneum is dissected from the properitoneal fat
