<ABSTRACT>
Throw-away syringe, of the type constituted by a cylindrical tubular 
body (1) in which a stopper (2) can be displaced in the direction of its 

axis, the displacement being controlled by a manually actuated stem (3). 
A second stopper (4) carrying a blade (6) placed in an adequate setting 

of said stopper (4) is fitted freely in the syringe, between the stopper 
(2) associated to the stem (3) and the discharge end (5) of the tubular 

body (11). The blade (6) is inoperative during the backward movement of 
the stopper (4) and operative to make a mark or incision in the advance 

direction, a mark through which the inner pressure of the cylindrical 
body is equalled to the atmospheric pressure to prevent sucking out and 

therefore re-using the syringe after its first use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a throw-away syringe, whose evident 
purpose is to be unserviceable after its first use with 
the aim to avoid infection risks derived from the use of syringes. At present, and due to certain infectious diseases, 
medicine professionals or even private individuals tend to 
use throw-away syringes both for injections and for the 
extraction of blood and akin substances. Even though for marketing purposes syringes are 
compulsorily designed for a single use, that is, they are 
considered throw-away items, many times they are re-used and 
this implies serious infection hazards. At present, the manufactures are trying to provide the 
public and the market in general terms with syringes that 
cannot be re-used. Nevertheless, the results obtained are 
still very much wanting, often because it is not possible to 
obtain unusable syringes after being used for the first time, 
and other times because the means applied to render them 
unusable are complex and even practically inapplicable. For this reason, we still do not know about a syringe 
that guarantees its spoilage after its first use. There are different state-of-the-art patents regarding 
to throw-away syringes, with the purpose to avoid infection 
or accidents among its users. Thus, the North American patent 4.391.273 claims a 
disposable non-reusable syringe, the North American patent 
3951146 also claims an indestructible disposable syringe that 
makes impossible for it to be reused. The patent PCT NO. WO 
90/07949 claims a disposable throw-away syringe and its 
manufacture procedure. Though its designers describe the application of this 
syringes, in fact none of them is endowed with all the 
features and advantages derived from the concept and the 
structure of the syringe described in this application for an  
 
Invention Patent. The aim of the invention is to obtain a syringe which, 
based in a simple solution, can be rendered unusable by 
itself, after its first and single use thus being impossible 
to reuse it. More precisely, the syringe proposed has the peculiarity 
that, being based in a tube in which a stopper associated to 
an axial stem can be actuated on, both externally and manually, 
it incorporates a second stopper fitted freely inside 
the tube, between the bottom or the discharge end and the 
first stopper associated to the actuated stem. Thus, when suction is effected, previously fitting both 
stoppers at the discharge end, both stoppers move along the 
syringe as a consequence of the vacuum generated.

<CLAIMS>
Throw-away syringe, of the type constituted by a 
cylindrical tubular body in which a stopper can be displaced 

in the direction of it axis. It is controlled by a manually 
actuated stem and characterised because, between the stopper 

associated to the stem and the discharge end of the tubular 
body there is a second stopper freely placed which carries a 

blade fitted in an adequate setting in the above stopper, a 
blade inoperative during the backward movement of the stopper 

and operative to make a mark or incision in the advance direction, 
a mark through which the inner pressure of the 

cylindrical body is equalled to the atmospheric pressure to 
prevent sucking out and therefore reusing the syringe after 

its first use. 
Throw-away syringe according to claim one 
characterised by the fact that the blade is fitted in a 

swivelling fashion to make it possible to render it 
inefficient or inoperative in one of the directions of 

movement and operative in the opposite direction of movement. 
Throw-away syringe according to the above claims, 
characterised by the fact that the blade is fitted on the 

stopper associated to the stem. 
Throw-away syringe according to claims 1 and 3 characterised 
because the blade is constituted by an elastic appendix 

which is a part of the body itself or is an essential 
part of the stopper. 
Throw-away syringe according to the above claims, 
characterised because the mouth of the cylindrical tubular 

body has an inner ring-shaped ledge, which creates a stop to 
prevent the extraction of the stopper joined to the relevant 

actuated stem.
