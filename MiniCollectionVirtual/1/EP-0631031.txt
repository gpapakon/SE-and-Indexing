<ABSTRACT>
Sliding door (gate) (1) which is guided, such that it can be moved back and forth in the displacement direction, by means of a stationary drive-motor unit which exhibits an output pinion (2) which engages in a meshing manner into a rack formation which is retained on the door leaf or base member and comprises a series of rack segments which are inserted one after the other into a retaining rail (4), running in the displacement direction of the door leaf and secured thereon, which are fixed in their pitch sequence, and which, for the purpose of protecting against the occurence of wear caused by impact, can be displaced in a rail (4) at both ends via buffer elements (19) against the elastic deformation thereof.

<CLAIMS>
A sliding door (1), especially a sliding door base
beam with a door assembly of freely-selectable

design attached thereto, guided moveably backwards
and forwards in the direction of sliding-by means

of a fixedly-arranged drive motor unit, which has a
drive take-off sprocket which meshes interlockingly

with a toothed rack formation (3) fixed to the door
leaf or base beam (1), wherein the toothed rack

formation (3) is composed of a row of toothed rack
segments (5, 5', 5") mounted consecutively in a

holding rail (4) running in the sliding direction
of the door leaf and attached thereto, these

toothed rack segments being produced as finished
cast parts and being fixed together in sequence

according to their tooth spacing, wherein the
toothed rack formation (5) in its entirety is

guided movably in the guide rail (4) in its
longitudinal direction and wherein the toothed rack

formation (5) is braced rigidly against the holding
rail (4) and the sliding door (1) in the

longitudinal direction of the holding rail (4) by
holding elements (20) with the intermediate

disposal of elastically-flexible buffers (19).
A sliding door according to claim 1, characterised
in that the toothed rack segments (5, 5', 5") are

provided with guide projections (7), jutting out on
both sides of the toothing formation, (6) which

engage in corresponding locating grooves (8) in the
holding rail (4).
A sliding door according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the toothed rack segments (5,

5', 5") are basically designed as identical cast 
units from the same, or identical, casting moulds.
A sliding door according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the toothed rack segments (5,

5', 5") are provided on their mutually facing
neighbouring end regions with an engagement

formation (9) comprising a plug part (10) formed on
the one toothed rack segment (5) and a socket part

(11) formed on the other toothed rack segment (5')
which can be brought into interlocking, torsion-proof

and pressure-proof connection with one

another, maintaining correct tooth spacing, in the
direction of sliding.
A sliding door according to claim 4, characterised
in that the plug part (10) is formed in a T-shape

with its web which faces away from the cross-beam
(13) in one piece on the face end of the associated

toothed rack segment (5, 5', 5") and that the
socket part (11) which accepts the plug part (10)

has a recess (14) adapted to the outer contour of
the T-shaped plug part (10) in its face end area of

the adjacent toothed rack segment (5, 5', 5").
A sliding door according to claim 6, characterised
in that the plug part (11), when seen from the side

opposite the side which has the toothed formation,
can be pushed into the assigned recess (14), in its

connecting state, approximately perpendicular to
the longitudinal direction of the toothed rack

segments (5, 5', 5") which are to be connected.
A sliding door according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the toothed rack segments (5,

5', 5") are designed inasmuch as shell bodies, as
the walls of the toothed formations (6) like those

of the base section (12) which support these, on 
which the guide projections (7) can be formed, and

those of the plug part (10) and the socket part
(11), as well as any provided shape rigidity ribs

(15), are maintained, at least predominantly, at
the same thickness.
A sliding door according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the sides of the teeth of the

teeth formation (6) are designed to run obliquely
deviating from the perpendicular by a relatively

small angle towards the door's direction of
movement and that correspondingly, the side course

of the face toothing of the drive take-off sprocket
(2) is arranged obliquely to the rotational axis.
A sliding door according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the tooth sides which run

transversely over the area of the engagement
formation (9) are each composed of partial areas

which are formed on the plug part (10) on the one
hand and the socket part (11) on the other hand,

especially in such a way that a middle area is
formed, seen over the width of the toothed rack

segment (5, 5', 5"), comprising a tooth side
formation formed in the area of the plug part (10),

and the edge areas of tooth side formations formed
in the area of the socket part (11), connected to

the middle area on both sides.
A sliding door according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the toothed rack formation

(3) is supported at both ends by elastic buffers
(19) in the sliding direction of the holding rails

(4), these buffers being designed as metallic
spring elements, preferably elastic plastic

elements, especially made from soft polyurethane. 
A sliding door according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the toothed rack segments (5,

5', 5") comprise plastic and/or the holding rails
comprise metal, especially on the basis of

aluminium.
A sliding door according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that the holding rail (4) of the

toothed rack segments (5, 5', 5") is fixed with the
tooth formations (6) being orientated downwards and

a drive take-off sprocket (2) downwardly adjacently
engaging, overlapping the door leaf or base beam

(1) in a roof-shaped manner.
