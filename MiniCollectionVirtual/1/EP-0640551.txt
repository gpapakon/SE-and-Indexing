<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fastening for a coiler (1) which is mounted in a housing (2) and serves for depositing a fibre sliver (24). In known solutions, the bearing (13) of the coiler (1) is flanged from below on to an upper housing wall (5). The object of the invention is to simplify this type of fastening. It is therefore proposed that the bearing (13) have at least one bearing surface (A) which is directed transversely relative to the direction of insertion (X) of the coiler (1) and which can be brought into overlap with a supporting surface (8) of the housing (2).
