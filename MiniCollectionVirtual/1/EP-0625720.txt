<ABSTRACT>
In a liquid crystal element driving method, a voltage for putting a composite film (1) in a light scattering state and a voltage 
for putting the composite film (1) in a transparent state are applied thereto alternately, and the lengths of the voltage application 

time are varied so as to change the ratio of the light scattering state to the transparent state per unit time, whereby the quantity 
per unit time of the light permeated through the composite film (1) is controlled. A liquid crystal apparatus is provided with a 

drive circuit (D) for applying these driving voltages to a liquid crystal element (L). An illuminating apparatus is provided with 
such a crystal element (L) as mentioned above on an optical path of the projection light from a light source lamp (P).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid crystal
devices for adjustment of light, a driving method thereof,
a liquid crystal apparatus with a function of adjustment
of light for use in a light adjusting window, a display or
the like, various illuminations and indoor illuminations
incorporating such a liquid crystal apparatus, and an
illumination apparatus with a function of adjustment of
light for use in illuminations for television or movie
filming and photographing, or for a projecting type
television receiver, a projector, a slide projector or the
like.A liquid crystal device using materials such as
twisted nematic liquid crystal, super twisted nematic
liquid crystal and ferroelectric liquid crystal needs a
polarizer which causes loss of more than 50% of
unpolarized light, and when a liquid crystal device using
any of the above-described materials is used for a light-adjusting
element for an illumination apparatus using a 
light source irradiating a high-power light, large
development of the polarizer's temperature due to
absorbance of light is inevitable.In contrast, a liquid crystal device in which a
composite film in which a liquid crystal material fills a
series of pores in a film forming a transparent matrix
having a three dimensional network structure or in which a
liquid crystal material is dispersed in particles in a
film forming a transparent matrix sandwiched between
transparent substrates having a pair of transparent
conductive films does not require any polarizer, and
therefore the above-described disadvantage is overcome.In the above-described liquid crystal device, since
when no voltage is applied liquid crystal molecules are in
a random state based on the configuration of the interface
between the liquid crystal molecules and the transparent
matrix (anchoring effect), and incident light is scattered
and the composite film shows an opaque state. When
voltage (usually a rectangular wave or a sinusoidal wave
of about 200Hz) is applied to the region between the
transparent substrates having the pair of transparent
conductive films with the composite film held
therebetween, liquid crystal molecules having positive
dielectric anisotropy (Δε) are oriented in the direction
of electric field and gradually come into order increasing 
light transmittance, an electrooptic effect is brought
about, and a transparent state results. Note that the
term "transmittance" indicates the ratio of power of light
emitted from an element relative to power of light
incident to the element, but in the case of a
