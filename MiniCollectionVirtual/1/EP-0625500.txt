<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids or their disalts by reaction of alkali metal phenolates or naphtholates with carbon dioxide, optionally in the presence of a further alkali metal salt, is characterised in that the solid phenolate or naphtholate starting materials and optionally the alkali metal salt are introduced batchwise or continuously into the reaction mixture separately or together in the form of a dispersion in an inert organic liquid.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing aromatic hydroxy carboxylic 
acids or di-salts thereof by reaction of alkali 

metal phenolates or naphtholates with carbon dioxide, 
in the presence or absence of a further alkali 

metal salt, which comprises introducing the solid 
phenolate or naphtholate starting materials and, if 

desired, the alkali metal salt into the reaction 
mixture batchwise or continuously, separately or 

together, in the form of a dispersion in an inert 
organic liquid. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
dispersion is added steadily. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
dispersion is added
 in a pulsed manner. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the phenolate or naphtholate 

used is a compound of the formula (I) 

 
where the symbols and indices have the following 

meanings:  
 


M :
Li, Na, K; 
R :
independently of one another, OM, COOM, F, Cl, 
Br, I, NH
2
, CF
3
, an alkyl group having from 1 
to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having from 

1 to 6 carbon atoms; 
n :
0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
naphtholate used is potassium β-naphtholate. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the alkali metal salt used is 

potassium carbonate. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the inert organic liquid is an 

aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon or ether or a 
mixture of at least two such compounds. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the dispersion comprises from 5 

to 50% by weight, based on the total dispersion, of 
the alkali metal salt. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the dispersion comprises from 5 

to 70% by weight, based on the total dispersion, of 
phenolate or naphtholate. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, wherein the solids used have an average 

particle size of less than 50 µm. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding  
 

claims, wherein the alkali metal salt and 
phenolate or naphtholate are introduced into the 

reaction mixture in the form of a common dispersion. 
The process as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims 1 to 12, wherein the alkali metal salt 

and phenolate or naphtholate are introduced into the 
reaction mixture in the form of separate dispersions.
