<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device by means of which tobacco, in particular cut tobacco, is intended to be treated. The device contains a container (1), in particular a drum (2), having a rotating driver arrangement (6) and inlets (32) for vapour (steam) and/or air; the driver arrangement exhibits individual, mutually separate conveying surfaces (7) which are connected to a rotating shaft (12). By means of a low-outlay device of the abovementioned type, intensive treatment of the tobacco for expanding and/or loosening/mixing can be achieved.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for treating tobacco, in particular cut tobacco,
with a container (1, 2), with a rotating entraining arrangement

(6) having individual conveying surfaces (7) which are connected
to a rotary body (9, 12), and with inlets (32, 41) for steam

and/or air, characterized in that the container is designed as
a drum (2), with the inner wall of which the tobacco is in

communication during its conveyance, and in that the conveying
surfaces are designed as individual surfaces separated from one

another when seen in the axial direction.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
rotary body is designed as a rotating shaft (12).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 and/or 2, characterized in
that the drum (2) is stationarily arranged.
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the conveying surfaces (7) include angles

of between 20° and 60° with planes perpendicular to the axis of
rotation of the entraining arrangement (6).
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in that the
angles of conveying surfaces (7a, 7b) are different.
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the conveying surfaces (7) at least

approximately constitute parts of a helical conveyor.
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the inlets (32) for steam and/or air are

situated in the lower region (U) of the drum (2).
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized by a fluidized 
bed in the drum, formed by the steam and/or air.
Apparatus according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized in that
additional inlets (41) are provided in the upper region (O) of

the drum (2).
Apparatus according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized in that
the drum (2) is heated in the upper region (O).
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the drum (2) is of double-walled design,

in that the steam and/or air can be supplied to the space (28)
between the drum walls (26, 27), and in that through-passages

(32) are provided in the inner drum wall.
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that nozzles (50) for feeding in the steam

and/or air are provided in the drum wall (26).
Apparatus according to Claim 12, characterized in that the
nozzles (50) are directed towards the axis of the rotating

entraining arrangement (6).
Apparatus according to Claim 12 and/or 13, characterized in
that the nozzles (50) are directed opposite the conveying

direction (15) of the rotating entraining arrangement (6).
Apparatus according to Claim 12 and/or 13, characterized in
that the nozzles are directed in the conveying direction (15) of

the rotating entraining arrangement.
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the steam is provided for the expansion of

the tobacco.
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the steam and/or air is provided for 

separating tobacco parts which are sticking together or for
mixing tobacco parts of different types, nature or conditions.
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized by an absolute pressure of the steam, as saturated

steam, of between 1.5 and 10 bar.
