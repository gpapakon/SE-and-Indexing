<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an intraocular 
capsular shield and specifically a capsular shield used during 
cataract surgery for protection of the posterior capsule 
during the extraction of the lens nucleus. The history of cataract surgery has progressed 
significantly over a period of approximately forty years to 
the present state of the art. In the earliest days of 
cataract surgery and until the 1970s, the primary method for 
the removal of the cataract was referred to as intracapsular 
cataract extraction. This procedure involved the removal of 
the entire lens structure including the capsular bag. In 
particular, the extraction was accomplished by breaking the 
zonules to remove the lens and capsular bag as a total unit. The above described cataract operation was effective 
in removing the cloudy cataract and typically vision was 
restored by the use of special eye glasses and later by the 
use of contact lenses. However, the removal of the entire 
lens structure including the capsular bag allowed the vitreous 
body, which would normally would be retained behind the 
capsular bag and the retina, to move forward into the anterior 
area of the eye. Since the vitreous body normally helps to 
support the retina and is not normally present in the anterior 
portion of the eye, the movement of the vitreous body forward 
can lead to a number of potential postoperative complications 
including relatively high incidents of retinal detachment, 
glaucoma, corneal decompensation, and uveitis.  Fortunately, the techniques for cataract extraction 
progressed beyond the early intracapsular cataract extraction 
and specifically, the introduction of microscopes to cataract 
surgery allowed surgeons to improve their techniques 
considerably. Specifically, cataract surgery progressed 
wherein the surgeon now makes an opening in the anterior 
capsule and removes the nucleus and cortical material while 
leaving the posterior capsule intact. This type of surgery is 
referred to as extracapsular cataract surgery and represented 
a significant advance in cataract surgery since it allowed the 
surgeon to leave the posterior capsule in place to help 
support the vitreous body and to keep it from moving forward 
in the eye. As will be appreciated, this surgical advance 
significantly reduced post operative complications of cataract 
surgery. It should be noted that extracapsular cataract 
surgery had been performed before intracapsular cataract 
extraction, but the technology and specifically the 
instruments and lack
