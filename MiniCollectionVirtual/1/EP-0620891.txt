<ABSTRACT>
An obstruction detection system (10) for a vehicle window (30) includes a shade and/or a filter, and/or a dual channel monitoring system to prevent interference with the monitoring beam (18) by ambient noise; a transducer (48, 50 and 52) at either end and one at an intermediate apex monitors obstructions relative to nonlinear, rectilinear or curvilinear edges (40); a wide angle transducer, closely aligned pair of transducers, or a mechanical interrupter is used to ensure tripping the beam (18) by even small obstacles (86), and a camming surface (72) guides small obstacles into the path of the beam driven by the monitored window edge.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED OBSTRUCTION DETECTION SYSTEM FOR A VEHICLE WINDOWFIELD OF INVENTIONA This invention relates to an improved obstruction detectionâ– x system, and more particularly to such a system which monitors nonlinear, curvilinear or rectilinear window edges; which shades and/or filters the receiver against- noise that would mask the condition of the monitoring beam; eliminates blind spots in corners; guides small objects trapped by the advancing window to interfere with the monitoring beam; and uses a dual-channel technique to avoid disabling of the system by ambient noise.BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONAutomatic closure systems for vehicle windows are becoming more an more common wherein for example a driver can close any window in the vehicle by simple operation of an actuator button. Such automatic closure makes it essential that some safety interlock be provided to prevent obstructions such as human or animal parts; hands, arms, heads, paws, from being trapped between the edge of the closing window and the section of the frame that receives the window edge. Such safety precautions are even more imperative in more sophisticated systems which are wholly self-operating and do not even require actuation of an operating button or switch such as in systems which automatically close the windows of a parked car when rainfall is sensed.Most vehicle windows including side windows, sun roofs and the like, do not have uniformly straight edges which engage with the frame. Typically those edges are rectilinear or curvilinear and a series of monitoring beams and pairs of transmitter and receiver transducers must be used to follow the edge contour.Corner locations for transmitters and receivers present a special problem because they generally are accompanied by blind spots in which small obstructions like children's fingers can be missed so no alarm signal is delivered to stop advance of the closing windows. 

 A constant problem with obstruction detecting systems is that of ambient noise. Whether the monitoring beam be infrared, sound, ultrasound, light, or some other form of energy, ambient noise can trick the beam receiver into thinking the beam is uninterrupted and no obstacles have been detected because the . noise supplies sufficient input to the receiver even when the beam is actually blocked.SUMMARY OF INVENTION It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an improved obstruction detection system for a vehicle window.It is a further object of this invention to provide such a improved obstruction detection
