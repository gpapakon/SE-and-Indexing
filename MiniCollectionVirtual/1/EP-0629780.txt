<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a submersible-motor pump comprising an electric drive motor, below which the casing of a centrifugal pump is attached, the casing (15) of the motor being externally surrounded coaxially by a cooling jacket (16) through which the flow medium flows. The outlet of the cooling jacket annulus (17) is formed by a pipe (40) which is inserted in the cooling jacket annulus (17) axially parallel to the pump axis and extends from the partition (43) between pump casing (3) and motor as far as the topmost region of the annulus (17).

A submersible pump having an electric driving motor below 
which the casing (3) of a centrifugal pump is attached, the 

casing (15) of the motor being coaxially enclosed by a cooling 
jacket (16) through which conveying medium flows, the total 

discharge of the cooling jacket annular space (17) being formed 
by a tube (40) which is disposed in the cooling jacket annular 

space (17) axis-parallel with the pump axis and extends from the 
partition (43) between the pump casing (3) and the motor (1) as 

far as the zone of the annular space (17) furthest away from the 
centrifugal pump, characterized in that the inlet (42) of the 

discharge tube (40) is bent by substantially 90 degrees and is 
disposed in the direction of cooling liquid flow downstream of 

the portion of the tube first receiving the flow. 
A submersible pump according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the tube (40) is disposed adjacent the outside of the motor 

casing wall. 
A submersible pump according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the tube (40) bears against the outside of the motor casing 

wall. 
A submersible pump according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that in the upper zone the cooling jacket (16) 

tapers conically upwards, and the conically inclined zone (44) 
clamps and retains the upper end of the tube (40).
