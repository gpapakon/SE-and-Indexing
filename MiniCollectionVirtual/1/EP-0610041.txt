<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet recording apparatus has an ink container (102) 
which has a plurality of defined chambers (6a-f) for 

containing ink and a detecting device (120) which detects the 
residual ink quantity in the chambers. The detecting 

device has photosensors (120a-e) fixed in the recording 
apparatus which can detect the residual ink quantity in 

the chambers (6a-f) optically based on an amount of light 
passing through the chambers. As the ink container 

moves with a printhead (103) carried by a carriage (101), the 
photosensors (120a-e) detect the residual ink quantities in the 

chambers (6a-f) one after another, whereby a simple detecting 
device for an ink container (102) having multiple ink 

chambers (6a-f) can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to detecting consumption of
fluid from a container and, more particularly, to
detecting a decrease in the amount of ink in an ink
container of a recording apparatus such as an ink jet
printer, a copying apparatus or a facsimile machine.In an ink jet recording apparatus, it is preferable
that ink at a recording head ejection port is
maintained at a suitable negative pressure in order to
provide stable ink discharge from the ejection port,
and to prevent ink leakage from the ejection port when
the recording apparatus is not recording. One method
of providing this pressure condition involves
maintaining the ink level in an ink container lower
than the recording head. With that method, however,
the apparatus must be kept in a predetermined 
orientation during recording because gravity is used to
maintain the desired pressure condition.Another consideration involved in designing an ink jet
recording apparatus is the importance of monitoring ink
consumption, that is, being able to detect a decrease
in the amount of ink in the ink container. Typically,
the ink level in the ink container can be determined,
for example, by using a float, or by detecting a change
of impedance between electrodes located in the ink
container so they are exposed by degrees as the ink
level drops.In addition it has been desired in recent years to
provide a smaller, more portable ink jet printer. To
that end, an ink container carried on a carriage for
moving a recording head has been used instead of an ink
container separate from the carriage.Two conventional ink containers, which generate a
suitable negative pressure and so can prevent ink
leakage from the ink ejection port when the printer is
not recording, are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.As shown in Fig. 1, the ink container 201 is divided
into three chambers 206, 207 and 208 by two partition
walls 202a and 202b. The chambers 206, 207 and 208
communicate with each other through small diameter
orifices 203a and 203b formed in the partition walls
202a and 202b. The first chamber 206 communicates at
the bottom with an ink well 209 having a supply port
205 for supplying ink to an ink droplet producer with
an ejection outlet (for example, a recording head).
The third chamber 208 communicates at the bottom with
an overflow sump 211 through an orifice 203c and a drop
pipe 210. The overflow sump 211 communicates with the
atmosphere through a standpipe vent 204. During recording, an amount of ink corresponding to the
ink consumed by the ink droplet producer 205 is
supplied
