<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production
of alkoxyiminoacetamide compounds, particularly to an
industrial process for producing alkoxyiminoacetamide
compounds useful as agricultural fungicides.EP-A-0 477 631 and EP-A-0 432 503 disclose
certain processes for producing fungicides of the type
with which the present invention is concerned;
however, neither of these publications teach the
beneficial effect of the slow addition over a
considerable period of time of the halogenating agent
which is reacted with compound (III) as described
below. Also these publications are not concerned with
increasing the E-isomer content by isomerisation under
acidic conditions.Hitherto, the present inventors have studied to
develop agricultural fungicides for many years.
As a result, it has been found that alkoxyiminoacetamide
compounds of the formula (I): 

wherein A is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower
alkynyl, lower alkoxy, cyclo(lower)alkyl, cyclo(lower)alkenyl,
optionally substituted phenyl or an optionally
substituted heterocyclic group; B is -CH2-, -O-, -S-,-CH(OH)-,
-CO-, -NR3- (wherein R3 is hydrogen or lower 
alkyl), -CH2CH2-, -CH=CH-, -C≡C-, -CH2O-, -CH2S-, -CH2S(O)-,
-OCH2-, -SCH2-, -S(O)CH2- or epoxy; R is lower alkyl; R1 and
R2 are each independently hydrogen or lower alkyl; and the
bond ∼ represents any configuration of the E-isomer, Z-isomer
or a mixture of the E- and Z-isomers; exhibit potent
controlling activity against wide varieties of pathogens of
plants and cause little damage to useful plants such as
grains, vegetables, fruits and the like (see U.S. Patent
No. 5185342 and JP-A 4-182461). The characteristic of the
chemical structure of the alkoxyiminoacetamide compound (I)
is that the carboxyl group of the acetic acid moiety at the
o-position of the benzene ring is converted into an
optionally substituted carbamoyl group and that an
alkoxyimino group is introduced to the α-position. Based
on these characteristics, the compound (I) generally
exhibits more excellent fungicidal activity than that of a
corresponding alkyl alkoxyiminoacetate wherein the carboxyl
group of the carboxylic acid moiety is converted into an
alkoxycarbonyl group. The alkoxyiminoacetamide compound
(I) exists as the E- or Z-isomer. In general, the E-isomer
has superior fungicidal activity to that of the Z-isomer.The object of the present invention is to
provide an industrially useful process for producing 
alkoxyiminoacetamide compounds, particularly a process for
producing E-isomers of alkoxyiminoacetamide compounds
