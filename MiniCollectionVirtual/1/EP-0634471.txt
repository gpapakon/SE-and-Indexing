<ABSTRACT>
An improved coal gasification process employing 
fluid bed reactors is disclosed. In the improved 

process, sulfur absorption on limestone is balanced 
between gasification and spent solids combustion stages. 

Part of the sulfur is absorbed during gasification with 
an 
in situ
 alkaline sorbent to form a fuel gas. The raw 
fuel gas is fed to a metallic sorbent desulfurization 

reactor to remove residual sulfur. The spent metallic 
sorbent is regenerated with air, steam or a combination 

thereof, forming a regeneration offgas containing 
sulfur. The offgas is recycled to the combustion stage 

where the sulfur is absorbed on the alkaline sorbent 
from the gasifier. Substantially complete oxidation of 

sulfides in the limestone sorbent to sulfates can thus 
be promoted in the combustion stage to substantially 

eliminate sulfides from process waste solids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coal 
gasification and sulfur removal process, and more 
particularly to a process wherein the sulfur is removed 
for disposal substantially as an alkaline sulfate. The use of fluid bed coal gasification for power 
generation has increased in importance as petroleum 
reserves have declined, reliance on nuclear energy has 
diminished and coal reserves remain abundant. The art 
is currently in a state of rapid change as operating 
experience leads to improved performance. Fluid bed processes in general are based on an 
interaction of solid and gaseous phases to promote a 
chemical reaction. It is known that performance can be 
improved substantially by making the solids phase more 
accessible to the gas phase in terms of surface area 
available for reaction. However, solids size has 
generally been limited by separation technology needed 
to remove entrained particulates. Earliest systems used 
gas bubbled through a bed of particulates. The so-called 
"bubbling bed reactor" comprised a substantially 
continuous solids phase made up of relatively coarse 
sized particles (<5 cm) and a discontinuous gas phase 
having a low superficial velocity -- about 0.9-1.5 
m/sec. Due to the greater density of the solids phase, 
a relatively small amount of solids were carried over 
from the reactor. The development of high efficiency cyclone 
separators improved solids separation and permitted the 
reaction operating regime to be extended beyond the 
bubbling bed through the turbulent region to a transport 
hydrodynamic regime. In the fast bed transport regime, 
particle size is generally less than about 1.5 cm with a 
superficial velocity of 4.5-6 m/sec. In the pneumatic  
 
transport regime, particle size can generally be less 
than 0.3 mm with a superficial velocity of as much as 
12-18 m/sec. With finest particle size and highest 
velocity, the transport operating regime represents the 
current state of the art for fluid bed reactor design. Transition to the transport regime has also 
improved process control due to enhanced mixing of the 
reaction medium. As a result, current transport 
reactors can operate at an elevated pressure -- possibly 
up to about 4 MPa(g) (about 600 psig) -- to give higher 
thermal output per unit reactor cross-sectional area and 
greater output in the power cycle. A pressurized, 
transport mode fluid bed coal combustor is described in

Circulating Fluid Bed Combustor," Power Gen-88, December
