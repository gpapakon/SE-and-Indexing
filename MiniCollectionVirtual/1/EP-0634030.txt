<ABSTRACT>
A microelectronic device according to the present invention is made up of two or more functional units, which are all disposed on a single chip, or die. The present invention works on the strategy that all of the functional units on the die are not, and do not need to be operational at a given time in the execution of a computer program that is controlling the microelectronic device. The present invention on a very rapid basis (typically a half clock cycle), therefore, turns on and off the functional units of the microelectronic device in accordance with the requirements of the program being executed. This power down can be achieved by one of three techniques: turning off clock inputs to the functional units, interrupting the supply of power to the functional units, or deactivating input signals to the functional units. The operation of the present invention results in a very significant reduction in power consumption and corresponding heat dissipation by the microelectronic device as compared to the conventional approach of keeping all functional units operational all of the time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for reducing
power dissipation requirements and power consumed by single microelectronic
devices, and more particularly, to dynamic control of power consumption by and
resultant power dissipation required of such microelectronic devices.Power dissipation requirements of microelectronic devices (also called
semiconductor devices or semiconductor chips or integrated circuits) have become
critical in their design, fabrication and use. This is particularly true with very large
scale integrated (VLSI) devices and ultra large scale integrated (ULSI) devices,
which typically today have over 1,000,000 transistors (active passive) on a single
semiconductor die. The active devices are typically run (clocked) at very high speed
(25 MHz and 33 MHz speeds are now typical, with much higher clock rates
contemplated, for example, 250 MHz) in order to achieve desired system
functionality and performance.As is well known, the high clock rate and the high number of active devices,
regardless of the fabrication technology that is used, produce significant power
dissipation requirements when compared to the actual physical size of the die of the
microelectronic device. For purposes of illustration, a typical die with 1,000,000
active devices is fabricated on a die 15 mm by 15 mm and requires greater than 132 
pinouts. Such a microelectronic device can operate at a system clock speed of 30
MHz with 1 micrometer (µm) CMOS technology.The die must be permanently housed in a suitable housing or package, which
among other things (pin out, environmental, physical protection, etc.) must provide
adequate heat dissipation in order to prevent failure of the device.It is not uncommon for a single microelectronic device such as the example
above to generate in the range of 5-10 watts of heat that must be dissipated during
normal operation. As a result, the junction temperature of the die of such a
microelectronic device can reach 100°C for a ceramic package without heatsinking,
at the high end of the commercial temperature range, 70° ambient. The 5-10 watt
number will look small compared to the dissipation requirement for successive
generations of more powerful microelectronic devices, which are projected by year
2000 to have 100 million active devices on a single die. Contemplated die sizes are 25
mm by 25 mm.Various strategies for packaging have evolved to deal with large heat
dissipation. All include some type of heat sink or thermal grease arrangement for
rapidly drawing
