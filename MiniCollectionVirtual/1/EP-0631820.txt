<ABSTRACT>
When, on switching off screw centrifuges, the speed has dropped to such an extent that the centrifugal force is smaller than the force of gravity, the liquid ring formed inside the centrifuge drum under the centrifugal force collapses and there is a discharge of liquid at the solid discharge of the centrifuge. According to the invention, it is proposed, immediately before reaching this critical speed, to modify suddenly and briefly the speed of the centrifuge drum (2) and/or of the screw conveyor (4) so that the liquid ring "screws" through the screw turns (3) of the screw conveyor (4) to the other end of the centrifuge (1) - towards the discharge openings (5) for the liquid (11).

A method for the operation of helical conveyor centrifuges (1) for
the separation of fluid-solid mixes, comprising a centrifuge drum

(2), which is mounted so as to rotate about its longitudinal axis and
which encloses a coaxially arranged conveyor helix (4), rotating at

a different speed of rotation (leading or lagging), whose spirals are
fixed to a helix drum (13), whereby arrangements are provided for

the introduction of the mixture to be separated into the centrifuge
drum along its axis and at opposite ends of the centrifuge drum

openings (5, 6) for the extraction of the separated light and heavy
materials, whose radial separation from the centrifuge drum axis is

less than the distance of the centrifuge drum wall from the
centrifuge drum axis, so that in operation of the helical conveyor

centrifuge (1) a fluid ring forms under the influence of centrifugal
force within the centrifuge drum (2), 
characterised in that
 on
shutting down the centrifuge (1) immediately before the speed of

centrifuge rotation is reached, at which the resultant centrifugal
force corresponds to the force of gravity and below which a

collapse of the fluid ring would occur, the rotational speed of the
conveyor helix (4) is abruptly changed for a short time such that

since the fluid ring, due to its inertia, does not follow this change
of rotational speed, the direction of transport of the helix spirals (3)

on the fluid ring is reversed and the collapsing fluid ring is
transported with the aid of the helix (3) to the extraction opening

(5) for the light material (11).
A method in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 with
centrifuges (1) with faster running conveyor helices (4) the short

abrupt change of rotational speed is brought about by a braking
process of the conveyor helix (4). 
A method in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 with
centrifuges (1) with slower running conveyor helices (4) the short

abrupt change of rotational speed is brought about by an
acceleration of the conveyor helix (4).
