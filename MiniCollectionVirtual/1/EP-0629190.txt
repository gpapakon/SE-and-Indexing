<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOUNDS AS CALCIUM CHANNEL ANTAGONISTSThe present invention relates to nitrogen containing heterocyclic derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in therapy.EPA 266574 discloses 3-aryloxymethyl-4-phenylpiperidines, which compounds are said to have activity against calcium overload in brain cells and to be useful for the treatment of anoxia, ischemia, migraine and epilepsy. US Patent No. 4,918,073 describes a broad class of diarylaikyl-substituted cyclic amines (such as piperazines and piperidines) where the cyclic amine moiety is further substituted inter alia by a (hetero)atyloxyalkyl group, and US Patent No. 4,933,346 describes similar compounds having an arythioalkyl substituent. These compounds are said to have calcium antagonistic action.We have now found a group of novel cyclic amine derivatives which exhibit activity as calcium channel antagonists.The present invention therefore provides, in a first aspect, a compound of formula (I):Formula (I)in whichW is -CH2-, a bond, O or S;k is 0, or when W represents -CH2- k may also be 2, in which case the dotted lines represent single bonds;R is Cι_galkyl(phenyl)p, C2-8alkenyl(phenyl)p, C2-8alkynyl(phenyl)p, C3_gcycloalkyl orCι_galkylC3_gcycloalkyl, or R may also represent hydrogen when k is 2; p is 0 to 2 

n is 0 to 6; mis 0 to 6; andA is a bond, -CH=CH- or -C≡C- oxygen, sulphur or NR*; R! is hydrogen, Cι_ alkyl or phenylCι_4alkyl; and Ar is aryl or heteroaryl, each of which may be optionally substitued;with the provisos that :when W is a bond the side chain is α to the ring nitrogen atom;when W is CH2, k is zero, the side chain is at the 3- or 4-position of the piperidine ring and A is a bond, oxygen, sulphur or NR* then Ar is aryl substituted by phenoxy or substituted phenoxy or is a tricyclic heteroaryl group as hereinafter defined; andwhen W is CH2 and k is 2 the side chain - CH2)nA(CH2)mAr is not α to the nitrogen atom,and salts thereof.It will be appreciated that when k is zero the compound of formula 00 is a monocyclic heterocyclic compound viz a piperidino, pyrrolidino, morpholino or thiomorpholino derivative. When k is 2 the compound (I) is a tropane derivative.It will be understood that in the compounds of formula (I) the alkylcycloalkyl, alkylphenyl, alkenylphenyl and alkynylphenyl R groups are linked to the nitrogen atom via the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl moieties respectively.Preferably R is Cι_galkyl(phenyl)p in which p is 0 or 1, i.e. C]_galkyl, such as n-pentyl, or
