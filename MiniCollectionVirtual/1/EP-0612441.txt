<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical connector, in
particular one suitable for use in a telecommunications system,
particularly at a distribution point in a telephone network.Such connectors are necessary to connect wires from a
distribution cable from a central office to drop wires leading to a
subscriber's telephone or other equipment. Connections can be
made between the main wires to the central office and the drop
wires in a more or less permanent manner by means of a so-called
B-wire connector or other crimp or solder connection. This,
however, has the disadvantage that rearrangement of the network
connections cannot easily be made, and various specialized
features cannot easily be provided at the distribution point. Such
other features include electrical protection against, for example,
mains cross and lightening, and remote disconnect and testing.Terminal blocks have been designed to overcome these
problems, but they have tended to be large, complex and
expensive. Also most blocks are for a fixed number of pairs of
wires, and this has the disadvantage that a complete terminal
block has to be purchased even if only a few pairs are initially to
be connected. Also, repair of a partially damaged prior art block
is in general impossible.A selection of prior art designs where these problems are
minimized is as follows: US patents 3496522, 3708779, 3836944,
3971615, 3971616, 4047784, 4435034, 4444447,
4449777, 4580864, 4652070, 4741480, 4764125, 4767354,
4836800, 4954098, 4988311, 4993966, UK patents 2047984,
2129628, 2129630, 2176062, 2215532, 2196492,
and CA 1176330. In spite of these various designs, problems remain in producing a simple
connector that is easy to make and to use and that can provide features such as
environmental and/or electrical protection, modular design, suitable wire gauge range,
allowing line testing, re-usability, disconnection etc.We have now designed an electrical connector that can provide these features.Thus, the invention provides a connector for interconnecting first and second
electrical conductors, comprising
(a) a first part;(b) a second part; the first and/or second parts forming a housing;(c) a first contact attached to the first part and capable of making contact
with the first conductor; and(d) a second contact temporarily attached to the first part and capable of
making contact with the second conductor;
the second part having means for receiving the second contact when the first and
second parts are brought together such that the second contact remains
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A connector (1) for interconnecting first (6) and second (5) electrical
conductors, comprising


(a) a first part (3);
(b) a second part (2); the first and/or second parts forming a housing;
(c) a first contact (13) attached to the first part (3) and capable of making
contact with the first conductor (6); and
(d) a second contact (14) temporarily attached to the first part (3) and
capable of making contact with the second conductor (5);

the second part (2) having means for receiving the second contact (14) when
the first (3) and second (2) parts are brought together such that the second

contact (14) remains thus received on subsequent separation of the first and
second parts, and characterised in that, when the first and second parts are

brought together, the first contact (13) makes electrical contact with the first
conductor (6) and the second contact (14) makes electrical contact with the

second conductor (5), and when the first and second parts are subsequently
separated, the electrical contact between the first contact (13) and the first

conductor (6) is broken and that between the second contact (14) and the
second conductor (5) is retained.
A connector (1) according to claim 1, wherein the second contact (14)
comprises an IDC, the IDC being transferred from the first part (3) to the

second part (2) when the two parts are brought together and subsequently
separated.
A connector according to claim 1 or claim 2, having a third part (4) that can
provide electrical connections between the first (13) and second (14) contacts. 
A connector (1) according to claim 3, in which the first (13) and second (14)
contacts attached to the first part (3) are externally-accessible, each contact

being individually connectable to a conductor to be connected by the
connector, and the third part (4) being separable from the first part (3) by

translational motion, and subsequently by rotation.
A connector (1) according to any preceding claim, having four independent
electrical contacts (13, 14) such that when the first (3) and second (2) parts are

brought together an electrical connection is made between each contact and a
respective conductor (5, 6), the connector (1) having an externally-accessible

surface at which electrical connection can be made to each of the four contacts
(13,14).
A connector (1) according to claim 5, in which the first (3) and second (2)
parts can telescope together.
A connector (1) according to claim 5 or 6, in which each of the four contacts
(13, 14) terminates adjacent an opening at said surface.
A connector according to claim 7, in which each of the four contacts (13, 14)
terminates at a slot (11), each of two pairs of said slots being capable of

receiving an interconnecting member (23) externally of the connector.
A connector (1) according to any preceding claim having substantially planar
IDCs.
A connector (1) according to any preceding claim in which the contacts (13,
14) are elongate and lie substantially parallel to one another. 
A connector (1) according to any preceding claim, in which all of the contacts
(13, 14) are inserted into the connector or a part thereof substantially from one

direction.
A connector (1) according to any preceding claim, containing a sealing
material comprising a gel.
A connector (1) according to claim 12, in which the gel has a cone penetration
value of 100-350 (10
-1
mm) (ASTM D217-68) and/or an ultimate elongation of
at least 200% (ASTM D63 8-80).
A connector (1) according to any preceding claim having means for connection
thereof to an earthing strip.
An enclosure (30) for a telecommunications distribution point, having means
(34, 35, 36) for connection therein of a plurality of connectors (1) according to

any preceding claim and at least one such connector (1).
