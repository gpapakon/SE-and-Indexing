<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus include demodulation means arranged to 
receive inphase and quadrature phase input signals. A channel 

estimation means is provided for deriving a decision directed 
channel estimate from one or more signals which is used by the 

demodulation means for demodulating one or more of the signals 
transmitted over the same radio channel. The apparatus is for use 

in the demodulation of dual binary phase shift keying signals and 
various embodiments are possible, for example, and may be used 

in conjunction with pre-combining Rake architecture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for use in equipment providing
a digital radio link between a fixed and a mobile radio unit.Equipment for providing such a radio link is described in GB-A-2276064
(GB Patent Application Number 9304901.3). This application describes the use
of Wiener-like filters for providing good estimates of the amplitudes of the
inphase I, and quadrature phase Q, components of, for example, a spread
spectrum pilot signal.The problem of demodulating a spread spectrum signal using DBPSK
(Dual Binary Phase Shift Keying) modulation is discussed in IEEE Transactions
on Communications, Vol.37, No.3, March 1989, New York, US, pages 277-288,
R.A. Iltis: 'A GLRT-Based Spread-Spectrum Receiver for Joint Channel
Estimation and Interference Suppression'. Here an amplitude estimate can be
made of interface and multipath. This estimate may then be used to suppress
interference in a final demodulated signal.When demodulating DBPSK with no pilot reference it is still possible to
obtain and exploit a carrier reference by means of decision directed carrier
extraction. Samples are fed into the Wiener filter and are modified according to
the data decisions in order to provide a reference. Published PCT Patent
Application Number WO-A-94/27379, discloses a known demodulator that
performs this function. It should be noted that WO-A-94/27379 is considered
relevant under Art. 54(3) EPC. Figure 1 illustrates the known demodulator, as
disclosed in WO-A-94/27379. The demodulator has a plurality of Rake fingers 
10, 12, 14, 16. Each Rake finger comprises a signal correlator 18 which handles
an inphase signal from a down-converter, and a further signal correlator 20
which handles a quadrature phase signal from a down-converter. The output
signal from the correlator 18 is applied to a half linear multiplier 22 by way of a
one bit delay circuit 26. The output of the half linear multiplier 22 is applied to
an input of a Wiener-like filter 30. The output of the Wiener-like 
filter 30 is applied to a multiplier 34. The output of the correlator
18 is also applied to a further input of the multiplier 34, the
output of which is applied to a first input of an adder circuit 38.The output signal from the signal correlator 20 is applied to
a half linear multiplier 24 by way of a one bit delay circuit 28.
The output of the half linear multiplier 24 is applied to an input of
a further Wiener-like filter 32. The output of the Wiener-like
filter 32 is applied to an input of a multiplier 36. The output
