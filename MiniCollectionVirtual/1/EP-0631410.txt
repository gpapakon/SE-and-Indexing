<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an interactive communication method, particularly for applications in home automation. The method is characterised in that it consists in carrying out, on a coaxial cable, a two-way exchange of messages from a single primary station to secondary stations, by individual addressing or general- or restricted-broadcasting addressing, the initiative for the transmission being managed by the primary station.
