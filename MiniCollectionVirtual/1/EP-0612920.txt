<ABSTRACT>
A fuel delivery system (10) for an internal 
combustion engine delivers fuel by automatic selection 

of different sections of a fuel pumping ramp (49) of a 
cam mechanism (47) to control the rate of fuel 

injection by varying and shaping injection pressure 
waves to match engine air intake flow for different 

engine speed and load conditions. A solenoid operated 
fuel delivery valve (58,61) controls fuel timing and 

quantity by commands from a microprocessor (80) with 
inputs which includes torque demand, engine speed, cam 

mechanism position and solenoid current regulator 
signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and a 
system of shaping and injecting pulse waves of fuel 
into a combustion chamber of an internal combustion 
engine; for example to a system and method of 
controlling a fuel pumping event for optimising engine 
operation over a wide range of speeds and loads with 
improved fuel burning accompanied by reduced engine 
noise and exhaust emissions. Various systems have been devised to improve 
the performance of internal combustion engines and 
more particularly diesel engines by controlling fuel 
intake and subsequent pumping of the fuel into the 
combustion chambers of the engines through their 
injectors. Generally, prior systems and controllers for 
controlling the injection event have featured the 
ending of the event (1) by gradually decaying 
injection pressure as the pumping plungers slow down 
going over the nose of the pumping ramp of an 
associated cam, or (2) by rapidly terminating 
injection pressure with sharp cut off by opening a 
fuel feed port mechanically or electrically. However, 
such control produces high emissions when the engine 
runs at high speed and there is a gradual decay in 
injection pressure as in (1) above. Further, high 
emissions and also noise levels occur at low engine 
speeds including idle when there is a sharp cut off in 
injection pressure as in (2) above. Such prior 
systems offered either a sharp ending injection rate 
or a soft ending injection rate with the cam velocity 
profile chosen to be the best compromise profile for 
overall engine performance. To provide for improved 
injections, various constructions and methods have  
 
been devised which include electronically controlled 
injection. An example of such system is disclosed in 
US-A-4,757,795, in which a solenoid valve is employed 
to meter quantities of fuel into the combustion 
chambers. However, to meet new and higher standards 
for emission, noise and economy, new and improved fuel 
injection control systems and injection methods are 
required. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved method and apparatus for shaping and 
injecting fuel pulse waves. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a method of shaping and 
injecting pulse waves of fuel into a combustion 
chamber of an internal combustion engine as specified 
in claim 1. According to another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a system of shaping and 
injecting pulse waves of fuel as specified in claim 6. In a preferred embodiment, it is possible by

<CLAIMS>
A method of shaping and injecting pulse 
waves of fuel into a combustion chamber of an internal 

combustion engine which comprises a fuel distribution 
pump (10) including plunger means (36) which rides 

across a fuel control cam (49) with an intake ramp and 
a variable rate pumping ramp and including a spill 

valve (61) controlled by a selectively energisable 
solenoid (58) to effect the intake of fuel into the 

pump and to effect the pumping of a predetermined 
quantity of fuel as shaped pulse waves into the 

combustion chamber, the method comprising the steps of 
intaking fuel into the distribution pump while the 

plunger means is operating on the intake ramp of the 
control cam; prespilling fuel as the plunger means 

operates on the variable rate pumping ramp of the 
control cam; energising the solenoid when the plunger 

means is at a predetermined angle on the variable rate 
pumping ramp so that the plunger means initiates the 

shaping of a pulse wave of fuel at a predetermined 
rate; and de-energising the solenoid when the plunger 

means reaches a predetermined angle on the variable 
rate pumping ramp thereby to spill fuel at a rate 

which shapes the end of the pulse wave while effecting 
delivery of a predetermined quantity of fuel into the 

combustion chamber. 
A method according to claim 1, 
comprising the step of determining the angle on the 

control cam at which the plunger means initiates the 
pumping of a pulse wave into the combustion chamber. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the step of intaking fuel comprises the step 

of rotating the plunger means with respect to the 
variable rate pumping ramp of the control cam so as to 

intake fuel while the plunger means engages the intake 
 

ramp for subsequent pumping by the control cam into 
the combustion chamber while the plunger means engages 

segments of the variable rate pumping ramp. 
A method according to any preceding 
claim, wherein the step of respilling fuel includes 

the step of maintaining the solenoid in a de-energised 
condition while the plunger means is on the variable 

rate pumping ramp. 
A method according to any preceding 
claim, wherein for a variable rate pumping ramp which 

includes a profile providing a range of pulse wave 
profiles in accordance with the selected use of 

differing portions of the variable rate pumping ramp, 
the method comprises the steps of regulating the 

voltage applied across the solenoid so as to maintain 
a steady state current flow through the windings of 

the solenoid; detecting the voltage of the solenoid at 
which the solenoid effects the closure of the spill 

valve for shaping the beginning of injection and 
thereby determining the angular position of the 

plunger means on the variable rate pumping ramp; and 
effecting the de-energisation of the solenoid as the 

plunger means reaches a subsequent angular position on 
the variable rate pumping ramp at which a desired 

quantity of fuel is injected into the combustion 
chamber as a wave pulse with the end of the injection 

wave profiled with a sharp end at elevated engine 
speeds and a tapered end at a predetermined range of 

lower speeds from idle up to the predetermined speed. 
A system for shaping and injecting pulse 
waves of fuel from a supply into a combustion chamber 

of an internal combustion engine at rates which vary 
with engine speed and load from idle to wide open 

throttle comprising a control cam (49) including a 
fuel intake ramp and a fuel pumping ramp with varying 

 
slope so that fuel can be injected at varying rates; 

pumping plunger means (36) engaging the fuel intake 
and fuel pumping ramps and movable with respect 

thereto to effect the intake of fuel when operatively 
engaging at least a portion of the intake ramp and to 

effect the pumping of pulse waves of fuel into the 
fuel combustion chamber when operatively engaging 

varying sections of the pumping ramp; fuel routing

which the pumping plunger means is supplied with fuel 
from the fuel supply by action of the plunger means on 

the intake ramp and to a position in which the pumping 
plunger means supplies a pressure wave of fuel through 

the fuel delivery passage means to a combustion 
chamber by action of the plunger means on the pumping 

ramp; electrically energisable solenoid means (58) 
operative to move the valve means to at least one of 

said positions; regulator means (82) operatively 
connected to the solenoid means for regulating current 

supplied to the solenoid means and to provide a signal 
indicative of the angular position of the pumping 

plunger means on the intake ramp when the plunger 
means begins to pump fuel for injection into a 

combustion chamber; and control means (80) operative 
to receive output signals from the engine and from the 

regulator means for effecting the de-energisation of 
the solenoid when the pumping plunger means reaches an 

angle on the pumping ramp for the delivery of a 
desired quantity of fuel to the chamber so that the 

valve means moves to a position to terminate the 
 

injection of a fuel pulse wave at a rate controlled by 
operating conditions of the engine. 
A system according to claim 6, wherein 
the valve means is a spill valve (61) operatively 

mounted in the fuel routing means and is movable to a 
position by action of the solenoid to terminate the 

injection of fuel to the combustion chamber by
