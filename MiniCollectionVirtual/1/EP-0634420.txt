<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to star polymers of conjugated dienes 
which are cross-linkable and have a relatively low viscosity. More 
particularly, the invention relates to functionalized cross-linkable 
star polymers, especially epoxidized and hydroxy-containing 
cross-linkable star polymers having a relatively low 
viscosity. Block copolymers can be obtained by anionic polymerization of 
a conjugated diene, optionally with a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon, 
by using an organic alkali metal initiator. One commonly used 
method involves first polymerizing monomer A, such as styrene, to 
form a living polymer block. Then monomer B, such as butadiene or 
isoprene is polymerized at the end of the A block to form an A-B 
block polymer which is still living. This A-B block polymer is 
referred to as a diblock polymer or, when discussed in the context 
of a branched or star polymer, as a block polymer arm or living 
polymer arm. These block polymer arms are then coupled together by 
the addition of a coupling agent which reacts with two or more of 
the arms to form one compound. If two arms react, then the polymer 
will have the structure A-B-X-B-A where X is the coupling agent. 
Since X is only one molecule and is relatively small, the polymer 
looks and acts like a linear A-B-A block copolymer. This process 
is generally described in U.S. Patent No. 3,595,941, 3,468,972 and 
4,096,203. In general, when using the coupling process, the effort was 
always made to select a particular coupling agent or reaction 
conditions that resulted in the highest amount of A-B-A block 
copolymer being produced. Another way to state this is that they 
were trying to minimize the number of free block copolymer arms 
left after the coupling reaction was complete. U.S. Patent  
 
4,096,203 describes how to achieve different levels of free arms, 
referred to as uncoupled polymer in the patent, in the final 
product. It is well known that such linear polymers with relatively 
large amounts of free polymer arms or uncoupled polymer have a 
lower viscosity than such triblock copolymers with a very small 
amount of free polymer arms. There are some advantages to having a 
lower viscosity for the polymer. In fact, some people have gone so 
far as to add free polymer arms in the form of diblock to a 
triblock copolymer to lower its viscosity and increase the overall 
tack of the compositionsee for example U.S. Patents 4,080,348 and 
4,136,071. Unfortunately, the presence of such free polymer arms 
also dramatically decreases the overall
