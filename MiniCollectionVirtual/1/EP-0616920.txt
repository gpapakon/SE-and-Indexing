<CLAIMS>
Fastening device, in particular for outfit pieces such
as armrests, support grips, sun visors, rearview mirrors

to be fitted to body parts of automotive vehicles, with
a flange part (1, 14, 30) externally bearing on the body

part (11, 12; 40), with a holding part (6, 18, 34)
engaging at the rear a body opening (41) and with a

locking element (8, 26, 36), which can be introduced into
an opening (5, 17) of the flange part or into a body

opening (41) and which prevents a displacement of the
holding part (6, 18, 34), characterized in that the

holding part (6) comprises at least one angled lever (6),
which is supported rotationally on supports (4) of the

flange part (1) and can be rotated by means of a locking
element (8) from one position, which allows the insertion

of the holding part (6) into the body opening, to a
position, which engages at the rear the body opening.
Fastening element according to claim 1, characterised
in that the two angled levers (6) lying opposite each

other are supported with legs set at a 90Â° angle and by
means of bearing pins (46) on supports (4) of the flange

part (1) and are connected to each other in a separable
manner in the position for insertion into the body

opening.
Fastening element according to claim 2, characterised
in that the angled levers (6) are manufactured in a

single piece in plastic material and are connected to
each other by means of a film hinge (7).
Fastening element according to one of the claims from
1 to 3, characterised in that the locking element

comprises a pin (8), which can be inserted, through an
opening (5) in the flange part (1), into the body opening

between the angled levers (6), engages at the rear the
flange part (1) by means of detent protrusions (9) and

forms a lid (10) for the opening (5) in the flange part
(1).
Fastening element according to the preamble of claim
1, characterised in that the holding part (18) comprises 

a U-shaped spring (18) having legs (19), spring which can
be inserted, through an opening (17) in the flange part

(14) into the body opening, engages at the rear the body
opening with detent projections (21) and is supported

with legs (23) protruding transversely on the opening
(17) in the flange part, in that the legs (19) of the U-shaped

spring (18) present tongues (24) protruding beyond
the legs (23) protruding transversely and in that the

locking element comprises a pin (26) which can be locked
between the legs (19) of the U-shaped spring (18) and

which has a lid closing the opening (17) in the flange
part (14).
Fastening element according to claim 5, characterised
by a spring (18) made of metal with detent projections

(21) and with tongues (24) sheared and bent outwards
respectively from the legs (19) of the U-shaped spring

(18) and from the legs (23) protruding transversely.
Fastening element according to claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that the flange part (14) is

manufactured in a single piece of plastic material with
the locking element (26) and is connected to the lid (27)

on the locking element (26) by means of a film hinge
(29).
Fastening element according to the preamble of claim
1, characterised in that the holding element engaging at

the rear the body opening (41) is shaped as a hook (34)
manufactured in a single piece with the flange part (30)

and in that the locking element (36) bears on a side (43)
of the body opening (41) in the presence of unilateral

bearing of the hook (34) on the side (42) lying opposite
to the body opening (41).
Fastening element according to claim 8, characterised
in that the locking element comprises an elastic detent

hook (36), protruding transversely in an opening (33) in
the flange part (30).
Fastening element according to claim 9, characterised
in that the flange part (30), the hook (34), the detent

hook (36) and a lid (37) closing the opening (33) in the 
flange part (30) are manufactured in a single piece of

plastic material and the lid (37) is connected to the
flange part (30) by means of a film hinge (39).
