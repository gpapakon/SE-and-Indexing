<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the improvement of the solubility
of taxol in water. More particularly, it relates to the improvement of
the solubility of taxol in aqueous phase through conversion into an
inclusion product included in cyclodextrin (hereinafter referred to as
CD).Taxol is a compound extracted from the bark of Taxus brevifolia, a
type of yew tree which grows in North America. The compound has a
function of suppressing the division of cancer cells. It has been
observed that the compound can be particularly effective when
administered to patients suffering from ovarian cancer. Much attention
has therefore been paid to the substance as a novel, effective anti-cancer
drug. However, taxol, when administered to patients, was hardly
adsorbed due to its insolubility in water.Taxol has been only recently discovered, and little has been
reported so far on its solubility, except the disclosure in the
specification of Japanese Patent Application No. Hei4-339, 495
(339,495/1992), in which the solubility of taxol is improved by allowing
the compound to react in a mixture of an organic solvent and water with
α -CD, β -CD, γ -CD or a substituted α -, β - or γ -CD at least one
of the hydroxyl groups of which is substituted through an ether bond 
with at least one glucosyl group, maltosyl group or maltooligosaccharide
residue.In the above method, organic solvents are used for the preparation
of CD inclusion products. The use of organic solvents, however, is
disadvantageous from the point of view of cost, makes the operation
complicated and allows for the possibility of the contamination of
organic solvents.It is an object of the invention to provide a novel inclusion
product of taxol having an improved solubility in water.It is another object of the invention to provide a method for
producing a CD inclusion product of taxol in a convenient, economically
advantageous manner, without the use of organic solvents.Other objects of the invention will become apparent from the
following description.The invention provides:
(1) An inclusion product of taxol included in a substituted α -, β - or
γ -CD, one or more hydroxyl groups of which are substituted through an
ether bond with at least one member selected from a group consisting of
methyl, hydroxyethyl and hydroxypropyl groups, provided that the
substituted β-cyclodextrin is not haptakis-2,6-O-dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin,
randomly methylated β-cyclodextrin or 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin.(2) A method for producing an inclusion product of taxol included in CD,
