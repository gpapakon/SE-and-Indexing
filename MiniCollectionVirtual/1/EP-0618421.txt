<ABSTRACT>
A multi-cartridge shooting gun device includes a magazine 
(12) with a central hole (16) engaging a supporting 

shaft (18) extending from a gun housing (11). The magazine 
has a plurality of magazine holds (17) disposed around the 

axis, each for receiving a cartridge (14). A spring (15) is 
disposed in each cartridge hole (17) for being compressed 

between the magazine (12) and the respective cartridge (14). 
When a cartridge (14) is actuated by a trigger (41) the resilience 

of the spring (15) will assist shooting the cartridge 
(14) towards the target.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to gun device, and, more 
specifically, to gun device having a removable magazine that 
stored multiple pressed springs and cartridges to shoot out 
a cartridge by means of the kinetic energy of the pressed 
spring each time. A fishing gun is widely popular to most of diving lovers 
who usually have brought one during diving in the sea so as 
to protect themselves against the risk of being attacked by 
fish. The fishing gun of this sort has to reload a fish dart 
and push the chamber again for next shooting whenever a fish 
dart is being shot out. However in case of facing attack by 
sharks related protection should be carried out as fast as 
better and it would be even better if continuous shooting 
function permitted in order to continue to shoot once the 
first shoot had missed. But the traditional fishing gun 
fails to meet such kind of need. In addition all gas toy guns available on the market are 
using FLON 12 as kinetic energy for shooting plastic ball 
catridges. The defect lies in that they need to be refilled 
gas very often so that they can not be operated in facility. Therefore either a fishing gun or gas toy gun for shooting 
a fishing dart/plastic ball cartridge all kinetic energy it 
depends is from gun housing rather than cartridge itself 
that's why each has individual defect as mentioned above.  The multi-cartridge shooting gun device of the present 
invention includes a housing; a trigger pivotably mounted in 
the housing; a hammer member pivotably mounted in the 
housing and operatively connected with the hammer member; and 
a swivel member operatively connected with the trigger. It is characterized in by that:
 
   The multi-cartridge shooting gun device futher includes: 
(a) a supporting shaft, wherein one end of the supporting 
shaft is rotatably mounted in the gun housing and the other end 
is stretching over the gun hofusing and exposed to the gun 
housing, the supporting shaft driven by the driving member for 
revolving at intervals; and (b) a magazine, which includes: a cylinder, which have an 
engaging hole for casing around the outer rim of the supporting 
shaft, and have multiple magazine holes circulating around the 
axial center of the engaging hole and in parallel to the axial 
center; and multiple cartridges respectively mounted in the 
magazine holes; and multiple springs, which are respectively 
mounted in the magazine holes, one end of the spring is acted 
against the cartridge and the other end is acted against the 
cylinder, the

<CLAIMS>
A multi-cartridge shooting gun device, comprising 
   a gun housing (11), 

   a trigger (41) mounted on the housing (11), 
   a hammer member (44) movably mounted in the housing (11) 

for actuation by the trigger (41), and 
   a driving member (48) slidably mounted in the housing 

(11) for operation by the trigger (41), 
   characterised by 

   a supporting shaft (11) extending from the housing with 
one end rotatably mounted in the housing for being indexed by 

said driving member (48), and 
   a magazine (12) including 

   a cylinder (13) having a central hole (16) engaging 
the supporting shaft (18) and a plurality of parallel 

magazine holes (17) spaced around the axis each for 
receiving a cartridge (17), and 

   a plurality of springs (15) one mounted in each 
magazine hole (17), one end of each spring acting 

against the respective cartridge (14) and the other end 
acting against the cylinder (13) for being compressed by 

said cartridge and cylinder. 
The device of claim 1, wherein said magazine (12) further 
includes a steel ball (24) associated with each magazine 

hole (17) and an end plug member (26) inserted in each magazine 
 

hole (17) for retaining the steel ball (24) in a position 
in which it partly extends into the cylinder (13) and 

partly into the respective cartridge (14), so as to retain 
the cartridge (14) in a ready shooting position. 
The device of claim 1 or 2, wherein a plurality of aiming 
sights (19) are provided on the outer rim of the cylinder 

(13). 
The device of any of claims 1 to 3, further including a 
laser-beam sight (36) mounted in said supporting shaft (18) 

for aiming by laser beam. 
The device of any of claims 1 to 4, further including 
   a cartridge member (69), 

   a needle (63) slidably engaging one end of the cartridge 
member (69), with a variable loading chamber formed between 

the needle (63) and the cartridge member (69), the needle 
(63) having an injection plunger (66) in communication with 

the loading chamber and being provided with an injection 
port, and 

   a rubber guard (65) covering the outer periphery of the 

needle (63) and sealing the injection port of the plunger 
(63).
