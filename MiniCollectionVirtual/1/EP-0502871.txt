<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of open cell polyurethane foams. Open cell foams have been utilized as a means for 
providing soft cushioning in a variety of applications 
in the automotive and furniture industries. In addition, 
these foams have been frequently employed within toys, 
athletic equipment, filters and sponges. Such open cell polyurethane foams have 
traditionally been comprised of at least one polyol, an 
isocyanate, water, one or more surfactants, at least two 
catalysts which include a metallic catalyst as well as a 
tertiary amine catalyst, and, optionally, a blowing 
agent. The blowing agent is employed in order to enhance 
the expansion of the foam which is obtained from the 
reaction of the water with the isocyanate. 
Traditionally, these blowing agents include 
chlorofluorocarbons such as Freon 11 or 12 and/or low 
boiling solvents such as methylene chloride. However, certain problems associated with the use 
of chlorofluorocarbons, particularly environmental and 
public health problems, have led to the creation of an 
international agreement to reduce and eventually 
eliminate the use of these materials. Moreover, several 
states have already banned the use of methylene 
chloride due to health hazards which have been 
associated with its use. Thus, the art has been forced 
to look for alternative blowing agents.  
 One example of such a blowing agent has been liquid 
carbon dioxide as disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,184,419 
and 4,337,318. U.S. Patent No. 3,184,419 to Merriman, relates to a 
method for the production of polyurethane foam material. 
The method comprises the incorporation of a soluble 
inert gas under pressure in the liquified state into a 
liquid composition containing a prepolymer and a 
compound capable of reacting therewith to form a 
polyurethane foam composition. The carbon dioxide is 
introduced at a temperature below that which a 
substantial reaction between the prepolymer and the 
reactive compound takes place. The liquid composition 
is foamed by reducing the pressure of the mixer and 
raising the temperature of the foam to convert the 
composition to an elastomer. Because this process requires the use of a 
prepolymer in the production of the foam, it can not be 
economically employed for large scale production. 
Moreover, this patent process requires cooling of the 
inert gas to aid in maintaining it in a liquid state 
which also adds to the expense of this procedure. U.S. Patent No. 4,337,318 to Doyle relates to a 
"one shot

A process for the production of a flexible, open-cell polyurethane foam, 
the process comprising: 


a) mixing the following components at ambient temperatures in a 
mixing zone: 


i) a diisocyanate having a functionality of 2.0 to 2.7, 
ii) at least one hydrogen donor having a functionality of 2 to 
4 and which is at least one polyol having a molecular 

weight of 2000 to 6500, 
iii) at least one surfactant which is effective in forming an 
open-cell polyurethane foam, 
iv) at least one catalyst, and 
v) a blowing agent comprising a gas having a boiling point 
below approximately -73°C (-100°F) at atmospheric 

pressure, the mixture being subjected to a pressure in 
the mixing zone which is sufficient to maintain the 

blowing agent in the liquid state at ambient temperatures; 
b) ejecting the mixture from the mixing zone to atmospheric 
pressure; and 
c) curing the resultant foam at ambient temperatures. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the blowing agent comprises carbon 
dioxide, nitrogen, helium, tetrafluoroethylene, fluoroform, hexafluoroethane, or 

mixtures thereof.

dioxide.  

 
The process of claim 3, wherein the mixture in the mixing zone 
comprises greater than 3 percent by volume of carbon dioxide in the liquid 

state. 
The process of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the mixture is substantially 
free of water and the foam is produced in the absence of any substantial post-expansion. 
The process of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the mixture comprises 
water and the foam is produced with a degree of post-expansion. 
The process of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the mixture in the mixing 
zone comprises from 10 to 25 percent by volume of carbon dioxide in the

mixing zone comprises 3 to 40 percent by volume of carbon dioxide in the 

liquid state. 
The process of claims 6 or 8, wherein water is present in an amount of 
0.25 to 3 percent by weight of the total mixture. 
The process of any of claims 1 to 4, 6, 8 or 9, wherein the mixture 
further comprises an additional higher boiling point solvent which introduces a 

controlled minor amount of post-expansion into the foam.  
 
The process of claim 10, wherein the higher boiling point solvent comprises 
methylene chloride, methyl chloride, ethyl chloride, chloroform, 

chlorofluorocarbon, hydrochlorofluorocarbon, azodicarbonamides, hexane, 
heptane, or mixtures thereof. 
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the mixture is subjected 
in the mixing zone to a pressure of 21 to 345 bar (300 to 5000 psi). 
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the polyurethane foam 
has a density of 12 to 192 kg/m
3
 (0.75 to 12 pounds per cubic feet). 
The process of any preceding claim, wherein each of the components 
is separately metered into the mixing zone. 
The process of any preceding claim, wherein at least two of the components 
are pre-mixed prior to introduction into the mixing zone.
