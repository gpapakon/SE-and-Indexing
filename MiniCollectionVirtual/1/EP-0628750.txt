<ABSTRACT>
Tensioning device for a belt in which the belt (10) is tensioned by the application of an elastic force which is transmitted to it by a rotary element (16) interacting with it. The elastic force is generated by placing a member (17) made of a material of elastomeric or similar type under stress, this material forming the said rotary element or being associated with it. Such a device is particularly advantageous for ensuring good stability in the tension of a motor vehicle timing belt.

<CLAIMS>
A belt tensioning device comprising an elastically 
deformable rotating element (16) over which the belt (10) 

passes, the said element comprising a rigid collar (18, 18a) 
and a ring (17, 17a) of elastomeric or like material coaxial 

with the said collar, characterised in that the ring (17, 
17a) of elastomeric material is on the outside of the rigid 

collar (18, 18a) and constitutes an outer rim which is 
deformable in compression and which is intended to bear on 

the belt (10). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
ring (18, 18a) of elastomeric material has a woven material 

(28, 28a) on its outer surface. 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the said rigid collar (18, 18a) is fixed on the outer collar 

(19) of a rolling bearing (20, 20a). 
A device according to Claim 3, characterised in that it 
comprises means of throwing the axis (A) of the rolling 

bearing (20, 20a) off-centre in relation to a mounting axis 
(B) of the device on a carrier. 
A device according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
said off-centring means comprise a spindle (22) mounted to 

be a close fit in the inner collar (21) of the rolling 
bearing and formed with a through-bore (23) of axis (B) 

parallel with the axis (A) of the rolling bearing and off-centre 
in relation to this latter for passage of a pin (G) 

for fixing and locking on the carrier (S) once the belt has 
been tensioned. 
A device according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the material of the elastomeric or  

 
similar type is a polymer having good characteristics of 

resistance to temperature and the deformation of which is 
not accompanied by a substantial absorption of energy. 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the material of elastomeric or like 

type is chosen from among the chloroprene rubbers, the 
EPDM's or the nitrile-butadene rubbers (HNBR). 
A device according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the ring of elastomeric material (17, 

17a) is reinforced by one or more metallic inserts. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that it comprises a plurality of coaxial rings of 

elastomeric material with interposition of reinforcements 
between and coaxial with the said rings. 
A device according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the material of elastomeric type 

constituting the aforesaid ring or rings comprises voids to 
reduce weight.
