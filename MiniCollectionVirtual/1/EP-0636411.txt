<ABSTRACT>
A metallic honeycomb for use as catalyst, produced by alternatingly joining, through diffusion joining, flat 
and corrugated plates of stainless steel foil which contains over 1 % of silicon and forms a coating mainly comprising 

chromium oxide on the surface at high temperature. The foil material has a chemical composition comprising 0.2 
% or less of carbon, over 1 % to 5 % of silicon, 9-22 % of chromium, an impurity level to 0.8 % of aluminum, 

and if necessary at least one element selected from among rare earth elements including yttrium, niobium, vanadium, 
molybdenum and tungsten. The honeycomb is heat-treated in a vacuum heat-treatment furnace at a vacuum of 10⁻² - 

10⁻⁴ Torr and a temperature of 1,200 - 1,300°C for a holding time of 1 to less than 30 min.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a metallic honeycomb body
for supporting a catalyst which is used for a catalytic
device for purifying the exhaust gas of an internal
combustion engine and or for a catalytic device in a
chemical plant.Recently, the number of a metallic carrier used for
a catalytic device for purifying the exhaust gas from an
internal combustion engine, particularly a gasoline
engine of a car, have gradually increased. This is
because a metallic carrier has a greater porosity than
the ceramic carriers that have been used so far, and has
higher durability in an environment where temperature
changes are heavy. Generally, the metallic carrier is
fabricated by the following procedure: forming a flat
foil having a thickness of about 50 µm from a heat-resisting
stainless steel foil and then forming a
corrugated foil by corrugating the flat foil, winding the
flat and corrugated foils or stacking the both foils to
form a honeycomb body, accommodating the honeycomb body
in an outer jacket and then mutually bonding the
honeycomb body and the jacket.A Fe-Cr-Aℓ alloy foil having an excellent oxidation
resistance has been used for the stainless steel foil as
described in Japanese Examined Patent Publication
(Kokoku) Nos. 58-23138 and 54-15035 and Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 56-96726. The
foil forms an aluminum oxide film on the surface thereof
at a high temperature, and maintains an extremely high
oxidation resistance. Various bonding methods have been
employed, such as the brazing described in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 61-190574, the 
resistance welding described in Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 64-40180, the laser and
electron beam welding described in Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 54-13462, and various
other methods.The Fe-Cr-Aℓ alloy foil used for the honeycomb body,
such as a 20Cr-5Aℓ steel foil, has an excellent oxidation
resistance, but its workability is inferior because of
high Aℓ content. Accordingly, productivity is extremely
low and the production cost is high.The environment of the practical use of the
honeycomb body is about 800°C at the highest in most
cases, and the oxidation resistance of this foil is, in
many cases, excessive.A brazing is most widely used as the bonding method.
However, the brazing material used in this method is
expensive. Furthermore, the bonding process includes the
application of a binder, attachment of the brazing
material and vacuum heat-treatment, and is extremely
complicated.
