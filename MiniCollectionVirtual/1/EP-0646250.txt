<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems for
obtaining quantitative and qualitative measurements of
geologic structures. More specifically, the present
invention provides an efficient and effective method
for using information obtained via nuclear magnetic
resonance techniques to determine petrophysical
properties of geologic structures.As is known, a key petrophysical property in
determining whether a formation will produce viable
amounts of hydrocarbons is the water saturation, Sw,
of the formation. Sw is defined as the percentage
pore space of the formation that is filled with
formation water. If a formation's porosity (PHI) is
completely filled with water, Sw = 100 %. Obviously,
such a formation is of no interest to a person
searching for oil. Sw is related to the bulk-volume
water (BVW) of the formation, i.e., the percentage of
the unit volume of the formation that is formation
water, as follows:
BVW = PHI * Sw.The minimum possible water saturation of a
formation is known as irreducible water saturation,
SWIRR. A zone that is at irreducible water saturation
will produce all hydrocarbons and no water. The
irreducible water saturation of a formation is related 
to the average grain size of a formation. For
example, shales and clays, due to their platy
structure and small grain size have immense surface
areas compared to the same volume of sand grains. The
effect of this is to bind large quantities of water to
their structure. Additionally, due to their fine
grain size and the strong forces that hold the water
in place, shales have essentially zero permeability
and high porosity. Thus, shales decrease the porosity
of the formation that is available to hold free fluids
and increase the amount of water that is bound to the
formation. SWIRR is related to the water bound to the
formation, known as the bulk-volume irreducible water
(BVI) of the formation, i.e., the percentage of the
unit volume of the formation that is irreducible
formation water, as follows:
BVI = PHI * SWIRR.Given the critical importance of the SW as
discussed above, many techniques have been proposed
for determining its value for a given formation. In
log interpretation, the standard approach to water
saturation is through the Archie formation factor
process. The formation factor F is defined as
follows:
F = Ro/Rw = Cw/Co
where Ro is the resistivity of a reservoir rock when
fully saturated with aqueous electrolyte of
resistivity Rw, and Co and Cw are corresponding
conductivities. Further, given knowledge of porosity
(PHI) and
