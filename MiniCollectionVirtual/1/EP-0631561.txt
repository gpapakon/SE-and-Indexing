<ABSTRACT>
A vessel-transporting device has a recess coupled to a driving shaft and a centered star-shaped crown releasably secured thereto. In order to perceptibly lower the risk of soil and infection of the transported vessels while allowing the star-shaped crown to be easily and quickly exchanged, the recess (2) has several projecting extension arms (4) distributed around its circumference whose free ends support the star-shaped crown (3).

A transport device for vessels comprising a reception means 
(2) connected to a drive shaft (1), and a star collar (3) releasably 

secured to said reception means ana centered 
thereon, characterized in that the reception means (2) 

is provided with a plurality of extension arms (4) which 
project therefrom and which are distributed over the 

circumference thereof, the star collar (3) resting on 
the free ends of said extension arms (4). 
A transport device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the star collar (3) rests exclusively on the 

free ends of the extension arms (4) and is centered 
thereon. 
A transport device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the star collar (3) rests on the free ends 

of the extension arms (4) in the area of its inner, 
lower rim. 
A transport device according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the inner rim of the star collar (3) has an 

essentially rotationally symmetrical structural design. 
A transport device according to one of the claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the extensions arms (4) are 

uniformly distributed over the circumference of the reception 
means (2).  

 
A transport device according to one of the claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that three to six extension arms (4) 

are provided. 
A transport device according to one of the claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the extension arms (4) are arranged 

essentially radially with respect to the axis of 
rotation. 
A transport device according to claim 7, characterized 
in that the circumferential distance between two support 

surfaces defined by neighbouring extension arms (4) and 
used for supporting the star collar (3) is many times 

larger than the circumferential dimension of one support 
surface. 
A transport device according to claim 7 or 8, characterized 
in that a free space (5) is defined between the inner 

rim of the star collar (3) and the reception means 
(2), said free space (5) being only interrupted by the 

extension arms (4). 
A transport device according to one of the claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that, in the area of said inner, 

lower rim, the star collar (3) is provided with recesses 
(6) which are open towards the inside and at the bottom 

thereof and which are engaged by the free ends of the 
extension arms (4). 
A transport device according to one of the claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that the reception means (2) comprises 

a hub (7), which is secured to the drive shaft 
(1), and a plurality of rods (4) or bolts secured to 

said hub (7), said rods or bolts projecting from said 
hub like spokes and defining the extension arms which 

support the star collar (3).  
 
A transport device according to claim 11, characterized 
in that the rods (4) or bolts defining the extension 

arms have a circular cross-section. 
A transport device according to one of the claims 10 to 
12, characterized in that, for the purpose of determinign 

the position of the star collar (3), one extension 
arm (4) and the associated recess (6) are shorter 

than the other ones. 
A transport device according to one of the claims 1 to 
13, characterized in that at least one of the extension 

arms (4) has arranged thereon a releasable fastening 
means (8) for the star collar (3). 
A transport device according to one of the claims 1 to 
13, characterized in that at least one of said extension 

arms (4) is adapted to be displaced like a locking bar 
and engages a complementary recess in the star collar 

(3) for releasably fixing said star collar (3). 
A transport device according to one of the claims 1 to 
15, characterized in that the star collar (3) has connected 

thereto at least one star ring (9) via a plurality 
of freestanding spacer bolts (14).
