<ABSTRACT>
In the induction welding of tubes, a metal strip is shaped to form a split tube, the two margins of the slit being inductively heated and being connected by pressing them together to form a weld seam. A magnet core in the interior of the split tube and ferritic means outside the split tube in the area of the slit serve to guide the magnetic field and thus improve the utilisation of energy. In order to improve the utilisation of energy even further, the ferritic means (10, 11, 12, 13) project on the side of the inductor (3) facing the weld seam (8) into the slit (2) and are connected to the magnet body (9).
