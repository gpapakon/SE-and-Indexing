<ABSTRACT>
A device for removing hair from hairbrushes is characterised by a housing (2) with an inlet opening (7) and an extraction opening (8) and with deflection devices (10) which are arranged between the inlet opening and the extraction opening in such a way that they block the direct passage on the shortest path from the inlet opening to the extraction opening, and which form a friction surface at least in a part of their surfaces (4) which are contacted by hair when it is being sucked up by the device.
