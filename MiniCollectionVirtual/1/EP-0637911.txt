<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an oxidized limonene having a 
potent, rapidly acting antimicrobial activity that persists 
when stored; and an economical process for the preparation 
of that product. During the study of fresh limonene as a hand cleaner, 
the applicants found that fresh limonene is an excellent solvent, 
but it is not bactericidal. Conversely, limonene which 
has undergone auto-oxidation, unexpectedly, was found to have 
a minimal, inconsistent antibacterial activity which varied 
in potency from batch to batch. Therefore, it was decided 
to purposely oxidize limonene to try to enhance and stabilize 
the antimicrobial properties of the limonene. The applicants found that by bubbling air (or oxygen) 
into limonene to purposely oxidize (or oxygenate limonene 
which is the same) the oil, that it became bactericidal at 
progressively decreasing concentrations until it reached a 
point beyond which further oxidation caused a decrease in its 
bactericidal activity. As the purposeful oxidation of limonene 
progressed, it was noted that the physical properties of 
the limonene changed as its antimicrobial activity increased. 
Limonene, which was purposely oxidized was found to be effective 
in killing bacteria, yeasts, and fungi and its antimicrobial 
activity persisted unchanged when the purposely 
oxidized limonene was stored at 2-4°C in the dark, for 
periods exceeding one year.  
 The ability to produce limonene with a stable 
antimicrobial activity was unexpected and is not 
appreciated nor delineated in the prior art. In 
fact it is recognized in the prior art that the 
addition of air (or oxygen) to terpenes produces 
volatile mixtures of oxides and peroxides which 
antibacterial effect that is not rapidly 
bactericidal. It evaporates to a thick, non-usable 
gel before it becomes an effective 
antimicrobial when auto-oxidation is allowed to 
occur over a large surface area of the oil. On 
the other hand, limonene that is purposely 
oxidized becomes an excellent, stable bactericide 
and fungicide that is bactericidal and fungicidal 
in bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations and 
its activity can be demonstrated with even short 
interval application. Thus, the object of this invention is to 
economically produce oxidized limonene: (1) with a 
potent, rapidly acting antimicrobial activity, (2) 
that will retain its antimicrobial activity when 
stored, and (3) that is superior in its 
antimicrobial activity to the antimicrobial 
activity of auto-oxidized limonene. Limonene is a terpene with
