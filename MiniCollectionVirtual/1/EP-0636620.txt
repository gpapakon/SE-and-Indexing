<ABSTRACT>
Ethylene glycol carbonate (EGC) can be obtained in purified form from contaminated material which contains impurities from the group comprising starting substances, by-products and/or catalysts of the preparation process in that the contaminated EGC is subjected to a fractional melt crystallisation and the crystallisate of the purified EGC formed in this process is separated mechanically from the remaining contaminants dissolved in the residual melt.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the isolation of purified ethylene 
glycol carbonate (EGC) from a contaminated EGC which 

contains impurities from the group comprising starting 
materials, by-products and/or catalysts of the preparation 

process, characterized in that the contaminated EGC 
is subjected to a fractional melt crystallization and the 

crystals of the purified EGC formed in this case are 
mechanically separated off from the remaining impurities 

dissolved in the residual melt. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the fractional melt crystallization is carried out 

discontinuously. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the melt crystallization is carried out with the aid 

of a tube-bundle crystallizer, plate heat exchanger of 
diverse construction or a falling-film crystallizer. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the melt crystallization is carried out in multiple 

stages. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the separation method of the melt crystallization is 

combined with a separation step by distillation. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the formation of the crystals is initiated by seed 

crystals. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the melt of the EGC to be purified is cooled in the  

 
range from 38 to 20째C, preferably in the range from 37 to 

25째C, at a cooling rate of the cooling medium of 40 to 
0.1 K/h, preferably 10 to 0.5 K/h. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that, after a holding time of 0 to 100 minutes, preferably 

1 to 70 minutes, at the lowest temperature point of 
the cooling medium, the residual melt is separated off 

and the crystals are further purified by sweating at a 
heating rate of the heating medium of 40 to 0.1 K/h, 

preferably 20 to 0.5 K/h, up to a temperature of 22 to 
37째C, preferably 28 to 36째C.
