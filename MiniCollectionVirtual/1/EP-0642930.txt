<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for producing a stencil printing 
sheet 1 having the advantages in that the production of the 

stencil printing sheet is easy, a production cost thereof is 
reduced and there is no generation of any perforating 

failure at a time of stencil-making, any wrinkles, any 
conveying failure and any printing failure. The present 

invention comprises a process for producing a stencil 
printing sheet 1 by laminating a solvent-soluble resin film 

2 to a porous substrate 3 with an adhesive 4 or by 
heat-adhesion; and a process for producing a stencil 

printing sheet comprising the steps of: coating a solvent 
which dissolves a solvent-soluble resin film on the resin 

film 2, superposing a porous substrate 3 on this coated 
surface and drying off the superposed surface, to adhere the 

solvent-soluble resin film 2 to the porous substrate 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a
stencil printing sheet. Specifically, the present invention
relates to a process for producing a stencil printing sheet
having a solvent-soluble resin layer.In the prior art, a heat-sensitive stencil sheet is known
which is produced by laminating a thermoplastic resin film onto
a porous substrate with an adhesive. Stencil-making of this
heat-sensitive stencil sheet is, for example, carried out by
means of (1) a process of superposing a hand written or
preliminarily prepared manuscript onto the heat-sensitive stencil
sheet and then perforating by melting the thermoplastic resin
film using the heat generated from, for example, a flash lamp or
an infrared lamp (see for example US-A-4628813), and (2) a
process of bringing a thermal head which generates dot-like heat
zones, in accordance with electrical signals from letter or
picture information, into contact with the heat-sensitive stencil
sheet, and perforating by melting the thermoplastic resin film
(see for example US-A-4568951).However, the stencil-making processes described above
require a complicated process of bringing either a manuscript
heated by irradiated light or a thermal head into contact with
a heat-sensitive stencil sheet, conducting the heat to the
thermoplastic resin film of the heat-sensitive stencil sheet to 
melt the thermoplastic resin film and then shrinking the molten
material to perforate the thermoplastic resin film. These
stencil-making processes have the disadvantages that, for
example, (1) a perforating failure is produced on contact failure
between a thermoplastic resin film and either a manuscript which
has absorbed heat or a thermal head; (2) a perforating failure
is produced by nonuniformity in the applied pressure of a thermal
head, resulting in wrinkles in a heat-sensitive stencil sheet;
(3) the molten material of a thermoplastic resin film adheres to
a thermal head, resulting in a conveying failure of a heat-sensitive
stencil sheet; and (4) since the molten material is
left in a perforated portion, ink permeability is prevented,
resulting in printing failure.EP-A-0108509 discloses a process for producing a stencil
printing sheet in which the acid in an acid solution (stencil-making
solution) reacts with a water-insoluble polymer (a masking
film) to provide a water-soluble product, which product is
removed by water or a water-soluble liquid to obtain a perforated
stencil sheet.In recent years, a further improvement in the quality of
heat-sensitive stencil sheet has
