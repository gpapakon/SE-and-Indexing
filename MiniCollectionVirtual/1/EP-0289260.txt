<ABSTRACT>
An optical disc recording device comprises laser 
beam control means (12, 13, 14) of a mark length 

recording type which records data by forming pits on an 
optical disc (11) by radiation of laser beam for periods 

of time corresponding to pit lengths of respective pits. 
The laser beam control means shortens radiation time of 

laser beam as pit length of a pit to be formed 
increases. The laser beam control means also shortens 

radiation time of laser beam as immediately preceding 
blank length of a pit to be formed decreases. The 

shortening of the radiation time cancels tendency to 
increasing of pit length whereby a pit of pit length 

which is close to a set value can be formed. In one 
aspect of the invention, the laser beam control means 

advances starting of radiation of laser beam as 
immediately preceding blank length of a pit to be formed 

increases. The advancing of starting of radiation of 
laser beam enables adjusting of a pit starting end 

position to a predetermined position whereby blank 
length which is close to a set value can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical disc recording 
device of a mark length recording type which records 
data by forming pits on a disc with laser beam. The 
optical disc recording device is capable of reducing 
jitter occurring in a reproduced signal by reducing 
error in pit length (length of a pit in the advancing 
direction of a beam spot) or blank length (length of a 
blank portion of the disc between adjacent pits in the 
advancing direction of the beam spot) thereby improving 
the quality of the reproduced signal owing to 
improvement of signal-to-noise ratio. For recording data on a master disc of a Compact 
Disc (CD) or a video disc or a DRAW disc which can be 
used as a document filing disc memory by writing data 
thereon, a disc on which a recording film made of 
tellurium or bismuth is uniformly coated is rotated at a 
constant revolution velocity or constant linear volocity 
and pits are formed by melting the recording film with a 
laser beam. This recording has generally been 
performed by irradiating with a laser beam for a period of time 
corresponding to length of a pit to be formed (e.g., 231 
nsec for 1T in a Compact Disc) as shown in (a) in Fig. 2 
or by irradiating laser beam for a period of time 
corresponding to length of a pit to be formed minus a  
 
predetermined length of time t0 as shown in (b) of Fig. 
2 (EP-A-0 213 623). Pit length or blank length can be set at various 
values depending upon consecutive times of occurrence of 
"1" or "0" of data to be recorded (e.g., 3T to 11T in a 
Compact Disc format). Since time length during which 
laser beam is irradiated increases with increase in the 
pit length, the degree of heating of the recording film 
increases with increase in the pit length with a result 
that the recording film tends to be melted more quickly 
as the pit length increases. This phenomenon becomes 
more remarkable as heat conductivity of the recording 
film becomes larger relative to the linear velocity of 
the rotating disc. For this reason, in prior art recording devices in 
which laser beam is irradiated for a period of time 
corresponding to the pit length regardless of magnitude 
of the pit length as shown in (a) or (b) in Fig. 2, the 
pit length of a pit which is actually formed becomes 
increasingly larger than a preset value as the pit 
length increases as shown in Fig. 3 (on condition that 
the length of blank immediately before the pit remains 
the same) even if power of laser beam is adjusted so as 
to obtain a preset pit length at, e.g., a pit of
