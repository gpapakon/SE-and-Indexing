<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carbon dioxide snow apparatus. When molten metal contacts atmospheric air, oxides and nitrides are formed 
which create fumes and can reduce the metallurgical purity of the metal. In the 
past a number of shielding techniques have been used. For example, covering 
powders have been spread on the surface of the liquid metal to isolate the metal 
from the atmosphere. This technique is clearly ineffective when pouring molten 
metal in which case the problems of oxidation and fume generation are not 
prevented. More recently, carbon dioxide snow has been used for this application. The use 
of carbon dioxide has beneficial effects over other types of industrial gases. 
In practice, liquid carbon dioxide is expanded through a nozzle to atmospheric 
pressure to produce carbon dioxide snow. This snow is then injected to the 
desired location. It has been found that if the velocity of the snow is too low, little or no snow 
reaches the surface of the liquid metal or other desired location. It has also 
been found that if the velocity of the snow is too high, air is entrained with the 
snow and this is undesirable as it results in ineffective shielding and furthermore 
thermal exchange occurs between the hot air and the snow which results in 
untimely sublimation of the snow. Furthermore, if the velocity of the snow 
upon exiting the tube is too high you get very poor snow production. This is 
because snow initially forms as small pin point flakes. At very high velocities it 
will remain as pin point flakes and will tend to sublimate before effective 
shielding occurs. At lower velocities the pin point flakes merge to give snow 
flakes of sufficient size to resist untimely sublimination. As a result of the criticality of injection velocity, the snow discharge pipe is 
dimensioned so that the outlet velocity of the particles of snow is such that the 
jet has the required kinetic energy for projecting or spraying the carbon dioxide 
snow to the desired location whilst avoiding air aspiration which would result in 
an untimely sublimation of a part of the snow and hence have an adverse effect 
on shielding efficiency.  The prior art snow discharge pipe has an optimum flow rate which corresponds 
to the optimum velocity. This means that a given snow discharge tube has 
limited flexibility for different applications which require different flow rates. It is an object of the invention to provide a more flexible snow discharge 
apparatus. According to the invention there is provided a
