<ABSTRACT>
A borosilicate containing coating is formed on an 
electronic substrate by applying a borosilazane polymer on 

the substrate and converting it to borosilicate by heating in 
an oxidizing environment. The resultant thick planarizing 

coatings are useful as protective coatings and dielectric 
layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
applying borosilicate containing coatings on electronic 
substrates wherein borosilazane polymers are used as 
precursors to the borosilicate containing coatings. Various methods for the application of ceramic 
coatings on electronic devices are known in the art. For 
instance, it is known to use gaseous precursors in a variety 
of vapor deposition processes to produce coatings of silica, 
silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon carbide and the 
like. These coatings are useful as protective and dielectric 
layers. Similarly, the use of polymeric precursors for 
depositing ceramic coatings on electronic devices is also 
known in the art. For instance, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,749,631 
and 4,756,977 and the AccuglassTM product literature disclose 
silica coatings produced by applying solutions of silica 
precursors to the devices and then by heating the coated 
devices to convert the precursors to silica. These 
references, however, do not disclose the use of borosilazanes 
as borosilicate precursors. The use of polysilazanes for applying silicon, 
carbon and nitrogen containing ceramic coatings on electronic 
devices is also known in the art. For example, U.S. Patent 
Nos. 4,756,977 and 4,826,733 teach forming ceramic coatings 
by applying coatings of silicon and nitrogen containing 
polymers, such as polysilazanes, on such devices and then by 
heating the coated devices in an inert atmosphere. When 
those coatings are heated in an inert atmosphere, nitrogen is  
 
maintained in the polymer and coatings of silicon nitride or 
silicon carbonitride are formed. U.S. Patent No. 4,973,526 also describes a method 
of forming coatings containing silicon, oxygen and boron. 
The method comprises mixing hydrogen silsesquioxane resin 
with a boron oxide precursor, coating an electronic device 
with the mixture and heating the coated device to ceramify 
the coating. This reference also does not describe the use 
of borosilazanes. Finally, it is known that U.S. Patent 
Nos. 4,482,689 and 4,910,173 and European Patent 
Nos. 0 364 323 and 0 424 082 reveal the use of borosilazanes 
to form coatings. These references, however, do not teach or 
suggest the use of such materials on electronics and the 
coatings derived therefrom are also not borosilicates. We have found in our research that borosilicate 
containing coatings can be derived from borosilazane polymers 
and can be successfully applied on electronic substrates. 
Since the resultant coatings are thick, planar and
