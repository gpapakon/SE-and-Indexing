<ABSTRACT>
A dry mix for producing a quick-setting gel which 
has a texture which is as desirable as gelatin gels. 

The mix contains as components agglomerated potassium or 
sodium alginate, agglomerated calcium salt, sweetening 

agents, food acids, buffering agents and preferably 
anti-oxidant. The sweetening agents can be sugars, 

intensive sweeteners and/or hydrolyzed starches.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gel-forming composition
and more particularly to a one-package, gel-forming,
dry-mix composition which rapidly form a gel having a
texture which is equally as preferred as conventional
gelatin dessert gels.Gelatin dessert gels are well-known and highly
regarded by consumers. However, as crystalline gelatin
is not soluble in cold water, recipes for making gelatin
gels call for dissolution of the gelatin in boiling
water. The gelatin solution must then be cooled to
below about 70°F (21.1°C) in order to effect gelation.
Typically about a two-hour period is necessary in order
to produce gelatin desserts. There has long been a
desire to provide a gelatin dessert in quick-gel form.
Such a product would not have to be prepared hours in
advance of consumption, but could be made ready for
consumption within minutes. The prior art has disclosed
methods for producing cold-water soluble gelatin; 
however, the length of time needed to set the gel is
still in the one to two hour range.Pectin has been the basis of many attempts to
provide cold water-soluble, quick-set dessert gels.
Low-methoxyl (LM) pectins have the property of quickly
forming gels in water solution upon the addition of a
calcium salt or salts of other metals of the alkaline
earth series. However, if a mixture of LM pectin and
soluble calcium salt is added directly to cold water,
gelation will be initiated before the LM pectin has
fully dissolved. Such partial or premature gelling
prevents further dissolution of the pectin material and
results in a mushy or soupy mass as an end product.Attempts have been made to overcome the problem of
too rapid setting of LM pectin gels by means of a two-package
system wherein the pectin would first be fully
dissolved before addition of calcium salt. Such efforts
have not been commercially successful because of the
inconveniences involved in the use of separated
reactants and/or inferior textures. Other attempts have
sought to physically retard the solution of the calcium
salt such as by coating the salt with a vegetable or
artificial gum or by the use of heat-treated anhydrous
mono-calcium phosphate. Methods for increasing the
solubility of LM pectin in cold water to approach that
of the calcium salt, such as by co-drying the pectin
with sugars, have also been attempted. These and other
efforts at producing one-package, quick-set gels based
on LM-pectin are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,559,338
to Barch, 2,673,757 to Shepard et al., 2,701,767 to
Twieg et al. 2,809,894 to Poarch et al.,
