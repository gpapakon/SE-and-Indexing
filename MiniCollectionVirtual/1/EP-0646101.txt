<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to non-asbestos flexible sheet 
material suitable for use in gaskets operating at high 
temperature, such as those for the exhaust manifold of an 
internal combustion engine. Flexible sheet material having a basis of asbestos is made 
of fibres of asbestos bound together with a binder (often 
starch) and is made with the use of conventional 
paper-making machinery such as a Fourdrinier machine. In 
the manufacture of exhaust manifold gaskets, asbestos 
paper is drawn from a reel and, with a sheet of the metal 
(eg tinplate) which is to form the support element of the 
gasket, is passed between rollers which urge the two 
sheets into engagement with one another, as by pushing 
shallow tangs on the metal sheet into the paper. 
Additionally, before passage of the sheets between the 
rollers, adhesive may be applied to the metal sheet or to 
the paper to improve bonding after engagement. From the 
composite sheet thus formed blanks are cut in the desired 
shape. Composite sheet as just described is usually  
 
made in three forms: single-sided (one layer of metal 
support, and one layer of paper); double-sided paper; and 
double-sided metal. The paper employed is ordinarily made 
so that it will serve for all three forms of gasket. The present invention is concerned to provide flexible 
sheet material not having a basis of asbestos, but with 
the properties required for use in exhaust manifold and 
like gaskets, and in particular the flexibility and 
tensile strength to withstand being made up into gaskets 
without losing its integrity, the ability to withstand 
temperatures of 500 - 700° C, and the ability to retain 
its sealing capacity despite the constant fluctuations in 
temperature to which it may be subjected in use. It is already known, eg from our GB 2 138 854 A, to make 
such non-asbestos flexible sheet material by a paper-making 
procedure. We now provide an alternative process, 
which utilises a pre-formed non-woven tissue of glass (such as is now 
commercially available for the manufacture of 
glass-reinforced plastic articles) or like fibre stable 
at 700° C. The method of the invention can be employed to produce 
composite sheet having a sealing performance superior to 
that of sheet utilising a non-asbestos paper, as in its  
 
better stress-retention under clamping bolt pressure or 
its improved resistance to loss of integrity during 
prolonged use. The invention provides a method of making non-asbestos 
flexible sheet material suitable for use in gaskets 
operating

<CLAIMS>
A method of making non-asbestos flexible sheet material 
suitable for use in gaskets operating at high temperature, 

in which a pre-formed, non-woven tissue consisting of 
inorganic fibres stable at 700°C, is impregnated with an 

aqueous slurry of inorganic filler, said aqueous slurry 
including a dispersed elastomeric binder and a dispersed or 

dissolved binder which is essentially inorganic and is 
effective above 300°C; and the impregnated tissue is then 

dried. 
A method according to claim 1, in which the non-woven 
tissue is of glass fibre. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2 in which the inorganic 
filler is a clay. 
A method according to claim 3, in which the clay is ball 
clay, china clay or calcined china clay. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, in which the 
elastomeric binder is an acrylic elastomer. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, in which the 
elastomeric binder is a nitrile butadiene rubber.  

 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 6, in which the 
inorganic binder is a silica-type binder. 
A method according to claim 7, in which said binder is 
included in the slurry 
in the form of colloidal silica. 
A method of making non-asbestos flexible sheet material 
according to any preceding claim suitable for use in 

gaskets operating at high temperature, in which a preformed, 
non-woven tissue consisting of inorganic fibres 

stable at 700°C is impregnated with an aqueous slurry 
comprising from 75-95 dry wt % of inorganic filler, from 1-12 

dry wt % of a dispersed elastomeric binder and from 1-15 
dry wt % of a dispersed or dissolved binder which is 

essentially inorganic, and is effective about 300°C; and 
the impregnated tissue is then dried.
