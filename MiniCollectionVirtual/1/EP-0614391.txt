<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an installation for 
fighting fire, with at least one releasing means reacting under 
the influence of an indication of fire, to initiate a fire 
extinguishing process. In known equipment of this kind, especially in public 
spaces, such as restaurants, that particular individual 
sprinkler, the release ampoule or the like of which comes under 
the influence of hot air or smoke, is activated. It has been 
presumed that hot air or smoke rises practically in the vertical 
direction. In reality, ventilation, for example, causes the hot air or 
the smoke to move obliquely upwards, for which reason a sprinkler 
which is not positioned directly above the fire is often 
activated. An active sprinkler in the "wrong" position may lead 
to a general cooling in the room, with the result that the 
"correctly" positioned sprinkler above the fire remains inactive 
in spite of the development of the fire. GB-A-1474680 discloses a fire extinguishing installation 
including a plurality of fire sensors distributed within a space 
and extinguishing medium distributor heads spatially coordinated 
with the sensors and arranged to be supplied with an 
extinguishing medium through a pipe system, wherein the fire 
sensors are connected by electrical leads with a control 
apparatus arranged upon the response of a fire sensor to apply 
electrical signals to open control valves so that extinguishing 
medium is released from at least one of the distributor heads  
 
adjacent to the responsive fire sensor, while the distributor 
head coordinate with the responsive fire sensor remains inactive. One aim of the present invention is to provide a new fire-fighting 
installation which eliminates the above-mentioned 
problem. Accordingly, the present invention provides an installation 
for fighting fire, with at least one releasing means reacting 
under the influence of an indication of fire, to initiate a fire 
extinguishing process, wherein said releasing means is arranged 
to activate a group of spray heads, said group of spray heads 
being a part of a larger system of individually activatable spray 
head groups, said spray head groups being arranged to overlap 
each other by means of respective border spray heads, and said 
border spray heads being activatable alternatively within either 
respective group; characterised in that the releasing means is 
a sprinkler and in that check valves are arranged at said border 
spray heads to prevent extinguishing liquid from flowing from an 
activated group of

Installation for fighting fire, with at least one releasing 
means (3; 22; 91-94) reacting under the influence of an 

indication of fire, to initiate a fire extinguishing process, 
wherein said releasing means is arranged to activate a group of 

spray heads (4; 23; 95-103), said group of spray heads being a 
part of a larger system of individually activatable spray head 

groups, said spray head groups being arranged to overlap each 
other by means of respective border spray heads (95, 98, 101, 

102), and said border spray heads being activatable alternatively 
within either respective group; characterised in that the 

releasing means is a sprinkler and in that check valves (6; 30; 
112) are arranged at said border spray heads to prevent 

extinguishing liquid from flowing from an activated group of 
spray heads to an inactivated group of spray heads. 
Installation according to claim 1, in particular for public 
spaces, such as a restaurant room, wherein the releasing means 

(3; 91-94) and the group of spray heads (4; 95-103) are arranged 
in an upper region of the respective room. 
Installation according to claim 1, wherein at least one 
releasing means (22) is positioned in an upper region of the 

respective space and that at least one spray head (23) governed 
by said releasing means is positioned in the floor or in a wall 

of the respective space.  
 
Installation for fighting fire, with at least one releasing 
means (3) reacting under the influence of an indication of fire, 

to initiate a fire extinguishing process, wherein said releasing 
means is arranged to activate a group of spray heads (4); 

characterised in that the releasing means is a sprinkler 
arranged to distribute extinguishing liquid directly to the group 

of spray heads. 
Installation according to claim 4, wherein said group of 
spray heads is a part of a larger system of individually 

activatable spray head groups. 
Installation for fighting fire, with at least one releasing 
means (22; 91-94) reacting under the influence of an indication 

of fire, to initiate a fire extinguishing process, wherein said 
releasing means is arranged to activate a group of spray heads 

(23; 95-103); characterised in that the releasing means is a 
sprinkler arranged to distribute extinguishing liquid indirectly, 

through a guide valve (26a; 26b), to the group of spray heads. 
Installation according to claim 6, wherein said group of 
spray heads is a part of a larger system of individually 

activatable spray head groups. 
Installation according to claim 6, wherein said guide valve 
(26a; 26b) comprises a valve body (31; 61) with an inlet (32; 62) 

connected to a liquid feed line (25; 105), an outlet (34; 64) 
connected to at least one sprinkler (22; 91-94), and at least one  

 
outlet (35; 65; 66) connected to the group of spray heads (23; 

95-103), a spindle (36; 67) movable in the valve body, in sealed 
relation thereto, from a first position, closing connection from 

the valve inlet to the at least one outlet to the group of spray 
heads, to a second position, opening connection from the valve 

inlet to the at least one outlet to the group of spray heads, 
said spindle having end faces (45, 46; 76, 77) of equal area 

directed towards the valve inlet and the outlet to the at least 
one sprinkler, respectively, and an axial channel (44; 75) 

extending from one end face to the other end face, said movement 
from the first position to the second position being at least 

partially effected by the pressure fall which occurs over the 
axial channel of the spindle when extinguishing liquid flows 

through the channel to a released sprinkler. 
Installation according to claim 8, wherein the spindle 
comprises a piston (39; 70) which is in sealed relation to the 

valve body, a spring (41; 72) being arranged to act on one end 
face of the piston to keep the spindle in its first position when 

there is no liquid flow through the axial channel, and the other 
end face (54, 81) of the piston being under the influence of the 

pressure in the at least one outlet (35; 65; 66) to the group of 
spray heads. 
Installation according to claim 9, wherein a throttled valve 

element (47) is provided in the axial channel (44) of the spindle 
(36).  

 
Installation according to claim 9, wherein a branch line 
(108) is connected from at least one sprinkler (93) to an outlet 

(66) to the group of spray heads (95-103) in order, upon release, 
rapidly to bring said other end face (81) of the piston (70) 

under the influence of the operating liquid pressure.
