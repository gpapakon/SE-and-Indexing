<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTROPHORESIS GEL CONTAINER ASSEMBLIESThis invention relates to container assemblies for packaging prefabricated electrophoresis gels or to be cast electrophoresis gels; methods for manufacturing and using the same; and kits for employing such methods comprising the container assemblies with or without precast gels therein in combination with electrophoresis auxiliary items.Gel electrophoresis has been used for clinical diagnosis and for laboratory research for over thirty years. Originally all laboratories made (cast) their own gels for such tests, but as volume grew, prefabricated gels were manufactured for sale to clinical diagnostic laboratories, which benefitted most from their increased efficiency and standardization. Non-diagnostic laboratories normally still cast their own electrophoresis gels. It is highly desirable to introduce a faster, more uniform, and more efficient method of making such gels, since this would allow the benefits of standardization in such areas as clinical research, industrial research, and forensic and quality control testing, all of which are sensitive to the speed and efficiency of their operations.Gels for electrophoresis are intrinsically fragile, and must be protected to allow shipment. Physical protection is needed to prevent breakage or unacceptable marring on their surfaces. The packaging must also be vaporproof, to prevent drying out of the gels, which is undesirable in a standardized product. These requirements make the packaging of prepared gels very important. An additional requirement, usually unstated, is that the resulting package must be ergonomic, in that it is reasonably easy for the user to open and employ. 

 A variety of approaches have been taken to solve these problems.US 3,479,265 (Elevitch) discloses a disposable cassette whose back is sealed by a gel support film, and into which is injected a gelling mixture. The injection and relief ports are later sealed. The adhesive used to seal the film to the cassette is a non-hardening sealant, to allow the film and the gel adherent to it to be stripped from the cassette for use. These devices are believed to be in current commercial use by Ciba-Corning Diagnostics, and are sold contained in sealed moisture-proof bags.US 3,766,047 (Elevitch) mentions the same device, and processes for making it are described in US 3,767,560. Joining of the cassette (the "cover") to the support film (the "base") is by rubber cement or heat seal (col. 4, line 55 ff) . Since the cover is at this point coated with paraffin

CLAIMS :
1. A container assembly for an electrophoresis gel, characterized in that it comprises: a. A container adapted to receive an electrophoresis gel, comprising
[i] a generally planar bottom; [ii]
 at least one continuous side wall projecting upward from said bottom;
[iii] a flange projecting distally from the top of said side wall; b. a cover, adapted to contact said flange around its entire periphery; c. means for releasably sealing said cover to said flange. 2. The container assembly of claim 1 further characterized in that the plane of said flange is generally parallel with said bottom.
3. The container assembly of claim 1 further characterized in that said container is rectangular. 4. The container assembly of claim 1, further characterized in that the materials of said container assembly are selected to provide a low water vapor permeabilit .
5. A container as in claim 4, further characterized in that said permeability is such that less than 10% of a volume of water sealed in said container assembly will permeate through said container assembly during storage for one year at temperatures in the range of 4°C to 30°C. 6. The container assembly of claim 1, further characterized in that one or more pairs of recesses are formed in a side wall, adapted to hold one or more electrophoresis combs.
7. The container assembly of claim 1, further characterized in that said bottom comprises a depression 


 of an appropriate size and shape to accommodate an electrophoresis gel.
8. The container assembly of claim 1, further characterized in that it comprises an electrophoresis gel cast within said container.
9. The container assembly of claim 1, further characterized in that it comprises a protective layer on top of said gel.
10. A kit for electrophoresis, characterized by a gel packaged in a container, said container having a flange, and a cover sealed to said flange in a peelably releasable fashion, wherein said gel is suitable for electrophoresis.
11. A kit as in claim 10, further characterized by accessory items.
12. A kit as in claim 11, characterized in that at least one of said accessories is a buffer solution, a stain solution, a destaining solution, an adhesive tape for adhering said package to an electrophoresis cell, wicks, or a device for applying electric current to said gel.
13. A kit as in claim 10, characterized in that the gel is formed from a precursor solution by casting in said container, and then said cover is sealed to said container.
14. A kit as in claim 10, characterized in that the gel is formed outside of said container, and said gel is deposited in said container before said cover is sealed to said container. 15. A kit as in claim 14, characterized in that more than one preformed gel is deposited in said container before sealing.
16. A method of packaging a gel electrophoresis, characterized by the steps of depositing a gel in a container having a flange; and sealing said container with a releasably sealed cover. 


 17. A method as in claim 16, characterized in that the gel is formed outside the container, and deposited in said container as a preformed entity.
18. A method as in claim 17, characterized in that more than one gel is deposited in the container.
19. A method as in claim 16, characterized in that the gel is deposited in the container by casting in place.
