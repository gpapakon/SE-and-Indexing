<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-disk player
for selecting and taking one optical disk out of a lot of
optical disks to load the same into a record playing
equipment, and taking out the optical disk from the record
playing equipment after playing records on the optical disk.In recent years optical disk players for playing
records on optical disks have spread widely. Some of the
optical disk players comprise a multi-disk player for
selecting and taking one optical disk out of a lot of
optical disks contained in a record medium containing
portion to load the same into a record playing equipment,
and taking out the optical disk from the record playing
equipment after playing records on the optical disk to
return the same to its original position in the record
medium containing portion.This multi-disk player comprises a box-shaped or
groove-shaped chassis, a containing portion for containing a
plurality of optical disks (compact disks) with they being
arranged in a lot of upper and lower stages in the chassis,
and a disk loader for loading one disk selected out of the 
plurality of disks into the record playing equipment from
the containing portion and returning the disk in the record
playing equipment to its original position in the containing
portion, as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Gazette No. 52251/1989, or US-A-4 949 324.The containing portion comprises a magazine formed in
the shape of a box whose one side surface is opened, and the
disks are put one at a time on thin plate-shaped trays
arranged in a lot of upper and lower stages in the magazine.
An insertion port for getting the magazine in and out of the
chassis is provided on the front surface of the chassis, and
the magazine containing a lot of disks is gotten in and out
of the containing portion through the insertion port. This
insertion port is generally opened and closed by a front
panel which is provided with various keys used for operating
a multi-disk player, an AM/FM radio and the like.The above described disk loader takes out an arbitrary
selected disk, together with a tray on which the disk is
put, from the magazine loaded in the containing portion to
load the same into the record playing equipment, and takes
out the tray and the disk from the record playing equipment
after the playing is terminated to return the tray and the
disk to their original position in the magazine.The record playing equipment has a clamper provided
opposed to a spindle, receives the disk from the magazine 
and then, raises this
