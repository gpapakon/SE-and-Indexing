<ABSTRACT>
The articulator, which is used for simulating chewing movements, consists of a lower part (1) and an upper part (3) which are connected to each other via condylar articulations (8) and an associated articulation guide (10,11). The condylar articulations (8), which are designed as a double conical section towards the horizontal axis of the articulation, are arranged on the lower part (1), and the articulation guide (10,11) is arranged on the upper part (3), in such a manner that the upper part (3) can be removed from the lower part (1). In this articulator, firstly, the preconditions for an Arcon articulator are met, so that an optimum approximation to the natural model is achieved. Secondly, problem-free working is permitted, in the sense of easier handling as a result of a readily accessible working area between upper part (3) and lower part (1).

Articulator for simulating the positional relations 
and motional sequences in the human masticatory 

system, comprising a bottom part (1) and a top part 
(3) removable from the bottom part (1), said parts 

being connected to one another via condylar joints (8) 
and an associated joint guide, with the condylar 

joints (8) having a biconical profile in the direction 
of the horizontal joint axis and being disposed on the 

bottom part (1) and with the joint guides (10, 11) 
disposed on the top part (3) each having a joint 

opening (14) and a curve profile, characterized in 
that the joint guides are formed by joint plates (10) 

extending at right angles to the condylar joints and 
having joint dishes (11), the curve profile being 

provided in the joint dishes (11) and comprising two 
circular path portions (12, 13) of approximately equal 

radii but with their centres offset relative to one 
another in the plane of the joint plate (10). 
Articulator according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a locking clip (15), which is displaceable in a 

vertical direction and in a preset position is also 
capable of swinging out, is disposed laterally on the 

bottom part (1) for relative arresting, partial de-arresting 
and full de-arresting of top part (3) and 

bottom part (1).
