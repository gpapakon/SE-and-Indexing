<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for measuring wear in 
the lining of a container provided with a pivoted axle 

and an opening, and a container. Fixing of the 
coordinate systems (16, 17) of a measuring device (1) 

and the container (6) is performed by measuring the 
position of fixing points (P1, P2, P3) in the coordinate 

system (16) of the measuring device, whereafter the 
lining (10) on the inner surface of the container (6) 

is measured. The fixing is performed by measuring the 
position of the fixing points (P1, P2, P3) mounted in 

connection with the container in the coordinate system 
(16) of the measuring device (1) in a situation where 

the opening of the container faces away from the 
measuring device while the measuring device is directed 

towards the container bottom. The container (6) is 
rotated around its pivoted axle (11) to a position in 

which the opening (9) of the container (6) faces the 
measuring device (1). The fixing is performed utilizing 

the angle difference between angle data (α
1
) obtained 

during the measurement of the fixing points (P1, P2, P3) 
and angle data (α
2
) obtained after the rotation of the 
container (6), said angle difference being obtained by 

angle measurement known per se, measuring the inclination 
of the container (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for measuring
wear in the lining of a container provided with a
pivoted axle and an opening, in which method fixing of
the coordinate systems set for a measuring device and
the container is performed by the measuring device
emitting and receiving optical radiation, said fixing
comprising mathematically combining the coordinate
systems of the measuring device and the container by
measuring the position of specific fixing points in the
coordinate system of the measuring device and by
measuring angle data on the inclined position of the
container, and after the fixing the lining on the inner
surface of the container is measured by directing
optical radiation to the lining and receiving the
radiation reflected from the lining.The invention also relates to a container
comprising a bottom, a wall, an opening and a lining on
the inner surface thereof and provided with specific
fixing points employed in the measurement of wear in the
lining on the inner surface of the container in the
fixing step, during which fixing of the coordinate
systems set for the measuring device and the container
is performed.It is extremely significant to measure wear in
the lining of a container, such as a converter or ladle
used in steel making. This renders it possible to
optimize the service life of the container and to
prevent excessive wear in the lining from causing risks
pertaining to production or industrial safety. Wear
linings of converters must be renewed relatively often,
as their life time varies from a week or two normally 
to no more than a few months, depending on what is
melted in the converter, on the material of which the
lining is made, and naturally on the number of meltings
for which the converter is used. A converter can last
for about 100 to 5000 meltings. The shorter the
estimated life time of a lining, the greater is the need
to perform daily wear measurements. It is obvious that
in addition to normal, possibly daily, wear measurements
it is necessary to perform modelling measurements of the
unworn lining whenever a container provided with a new
lining is brought into use.The wear in a lining is measured by a method
based on measuring the transit time or phase difference
of a laser beam: the laser beam is directed to the
lining on the inner surface of a converter, from which
it is reflected back to the measuring device. On the
basis of the time difference between the emitting time
and the return time of the laser beam it is possible to
calculate the distance between the
