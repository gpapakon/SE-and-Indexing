A roof construction for a vehicle (1) 

with, extending in the longitudinal direction of the 
vehicle, lateral roof members (2) on which there are 

inwardly directed substantially horizontal flanges (8) 
and dimensionally unequivocal fixing points (5), 
with at least one roof part (4, 4A, 4B) for closing a 
roof opening disposed between the roof members (2), 
 
characterised in that
 
on each roof member (2) and in the longitudinal direction 

there are one behind another at least two fixing points (5) 
which are dimensionally unequivocal in relation to the 

design of the crude bodywork and on which a modularly 
designed inserted roof (3), of which at least one roof part 

(4, 4A, 4B) is pre-assembled on both sides on a 
longitudinally extending roof strip (11) can be mounted by 

means of fixing points (20) disposed at equal distance on 
the roof strips (11). 
A roof construction according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that as fixing points (5) there are on the roof members (2) 

and extending crosswise to the longitudinal axis of the 
vehicle screw-in bushes (12) which are accessible from the 

inside and into which it is possible to screw from the 
inside of the roof collar screws (13) which pass through the 

fixing points (20) on the roof strips (11). 
A roof construction according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the screw-in bushes (12) consist of flexible material, 

preferably polyamide, and are enclosed by a metal carrier 
sleeve (7). 
A roof construction according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that at least in the region of the 

fixing points (5) the roof members (2) are strengthened by 
at least one reinforcing plate (6A, 6B) disposed parallel  

 
with them and in that the screw-in bushes (1
2) and the 
carrier sleeves (7) are accommodated and supported by the 

reinforcing plate (6A, 6B) and an inwardly directed wall of 
the roof member (2). 
A roof construction according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that a continuous sealing strip of 

flexible material is provided between the flanges (8) and 
the roof strips (11). 
A roof construction according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the sealing strip consists of a layer (14) of adhesive 

material. 
A roof construction according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that during transport and 

installation of the inserted roof (2) tools (42) of 
transport, storage and installation means engage the fixing 

points (20). 
A roof construction according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that after installation of the 

inserted roof (3) it is possible to mount accessory parts 
(roof rack 44, roof superstructure 46) on the fixing points 

(20). 
A roof construction according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the roof strips (11) are at 

least partially constructed as a hollow profile having 
upwardly facing apertures (40) in the region of the fixing 

points (20). 
A roof construction according to Claim 9, characterised in 
that there are in the upper part of the roof strips (11) 

cover strips (33) having openable cover parts (34) in the 
region of the apertures (40).  

 
A roof construction according to Claim 10, characterised in 
that the cover strip (34) and the roof parts (4, 4A, 4B) are 

fixed on the roof strip (11) by means of the same fixing 
means (38). 
A roof construction according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that at least one of the roof parts 

(4) comprises a roof panel (17, 17A, 17B) adapted for 
displacement in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle in 

order to expose a sliding roof opening (28, 28A, 28B), a 
roof superstructure (14) which increases the roof height 

being mounted over the sliding roof opening (17B) at the 
fixing points (20). 
A roof construction according to Claim 12, characterised in 
that integrally formed on the roof strips (11) are guide 

rails (15) for the displaceable roof panel (17, 17A, 17B) as 
well as housings (19) for fixing a fixed headlining (37) of 

the vehicle. 
A roof construction according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the roof strips (11) and/or 

the cover strips (33) are curved and/or divided in a 
longitudinal direction in order to adapt to a curved roof 

contour. 
A roof construction according to Claim 14, characterised in 
that in the case of a vehicle contour having a rearwardly 

diminishing width a roof panel (17B) which is narrower at 
its rear edge can be displaceably guided on likewise 

rearwardly narrowing guide rails (15') by means of sliding 
elements (50) which permit of compensation of the width.
