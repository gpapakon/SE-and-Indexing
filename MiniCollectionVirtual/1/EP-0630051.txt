<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates with an integrated structure
bipolar switching transistor with controlled storage time.Bipolar transistors are frequently employed as switches in
self-oscillating circuits, such as electronic ballasts for
fluorescent lamps.In such applications the switching transistor, during the
"on" state, is deliberately overdriven; this gives rise to a
significant storage of minority carrier charge, which causes
the transistor to conduct for a certain time interval (called
"storage time") after the base driving voltage is dropped. If
the transistor's storage time is comparable with the
oscillation period of the circuit, the power delivered to the
load, as well as the circuit's oscillation frequency, are
heavily affected. It is therefore necessary to make use of
transistors having a well-known storage time, which moreover
exhibit a low dispersion of this parameter from each other.To achieve such objects, integrated circuits manufacturers
make available different selections of transistors with
guaranteed electrical characteristics; various techniques for
controlling minority carrier lifetime are also known
(introduction of dopant belonging to metallic species,
electronic or protonic irradiation etc.).An effective reduction of the storage time can also be
achieved by providing the switching transistor with suitable
integrated circuitry, such as Schottky diodes or antisaturation
circuits. Schottky diodes are generally connected in parallel to the
base-collector junction of the switching transistor to clamp
the voltage across the junction and limit the charge storage.
Since, however, in current technology Schottky diodes cannot
sustain reverse voltages of the order of 400V-700V, and since
such values of voltage are encountered in some applications,
this solution is impracticable.A typical antisaturation circuit, known as "Baker clamp",
comprises two junction diodes connected in series between an
external base terminal and the base of the switching
transistor, and a third junction diode with anode and cathode
respectively connected to said base terminal and to the
collector of the transistor. When the voltage drop across the
first two diodes plus the base-collector voltage of the
transistor is sufficient to turn-on the third diode, this last
will start draining current from the base terminal, thus
reducing the base current of the transistor; the base-collector
junction of the transistor can never become forward-biased and
the saturation of the switching transistor is consequently
prevented.A
