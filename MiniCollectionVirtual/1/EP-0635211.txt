<ABSTRACT>
Regenerated cellulose food packaging film, including fibrous 
food casings have modified cling properties for packaging dry and 

semi-dry type sausage products, and particularly specialty dry 
sausage recipes. The cellulosic food casings have a fibrous 

reinforcement impregnated with a coating composition containing an 
admixture of a viscose solution and a food grade cationic thermosetting 

polymeric adhering agent. The coating composition is 
applied in a single step by injecting into the viscose solution 

before being extruded into the fibrous web. This assures both even 
distribution of the polymeric adhering agent in the web, as well as 

maintenance of a constant level of polymer being applied during the 
coating process. The degree of cling/adherence of the casing to 

the meat mass is more uniform over the entire circumference of the 
tubular casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to improved food
packaging films, and more specifically, to fibrous reinforced food
casings having modified release/cling properties for packaging meat
products, and particularly in manufacturing and packaging dry and
semi-dry sausage products.In the manufacture of processed sausage products, a meat
emulsion is prepared from comminuted meat together with fillers,
seasonings, spices, etc. A tubular food casing, such as one
containing nonedible cellulose, is loaded onto the stuffing horn of
a filling machine and stuffed with the meat emulsion. In the case
of small sausage products, like frankfurters, the filled casings
are twisted, tied or clipped into suitable links at predetermined
intervals and further processed. For larger sausage products, like
bologna, salami, and the like, the meat emulsion is introduced into
larger heavier walled casings or casings having fibrous reinforcements,
and formed into chubs or lengthy individual sausage
sticks or logs for further processing, e.g. cooking and smoking.One category of larger meat products includes the so called
dry or semi-dry sausages, sometimes referred to as cervelats or
summer sausage, which includes such representative examples as air 
dried pepperoni, soft salami, hard or dry salami, and the like. As
the name suggests, this type of sausage has a reduced moisture
content, and its preparation usually includes drying as one step in
its manufacture. Dry sausage can also have a lower fat content
than other types of sausage products, and depending on the
particular type, may also be smoked. Cooking can also be performed
in some instances during the smoking step.Food casings employed in packaging and processing dry or semi-dry
sausage products are usually fibrous type casings consisting of
a fibrous reinforcement in the form of a web, usually a paper,
formed and seamed into a tubular body, impregnated with viscose
solution and regenerated in-situ. Because the encased meat mass of
dry or semi-dry sausage products undergo shrinkage during
processing and drying, dry sausage casings preferably have an
affinity for the encased meat mass. That is, unless the dry
sausage casing adheres to the meat mass during processing and
drying, separation between the meat mass and the side wall of the
casing occurs which increases the potential for mold growth, and a
final product having an unappetizing appearance. Such products not
only have poor customer acceptance, but can also have shorter
shelf-life expectancies.To help overcome the

<CLAIMS>
A food tubular packaging film comprising a fibrous reinforcement which comprises a
generally tubular shaped web having interior and exterior walls with at least said

interior wall being uniformly impregnated with a regenerated cellulose composition,

characterized in
 that the regenerated cellulose composition comprises an admixture of
regenerated viscose and a food grade cationic polymeric adhering agent which imparts

to said film, cling properties for a food product packaged within such film.
The food packaging film of claim 1 further 
characterized in
 that said cationic polymeric
adhering agent is present in said composition in a sufficient amount to impart low

level cling properties to said film when in contact with a foodstuff.
The food packaging film of claim 1 or 2 further 
characterized in
 that said regenerated
cellulose composition comprises from about 0,01 to less than about 0.75 wt.% of

said cationic polymeric adhering agent.
The food packaging film of any of the preceding claims 
characterized in
 that said food
grade cationic polymeric adhering agent is a thermosetting material selected from the

group consisting of expoxy substituted poly-secondary amines and melamine-formaldehyde
polymers.
The food packaging film of claim 4 further 
chracterized in
 that said epoxy substituted
polysecondary amine thermosetting polymer is a condensation product of epichlorohydrin

and a polyamine prepolymer formed from a dicarboxylic acid and a diethylenetriamine.
A method of preparing a regenerated cellulose food casing having a fibrous reinforcement
in the form of a tubular body with interior and exterior wall surfaces by the

steps of impregnating said surfaces with a viscose coating solution and regenerating
the viscose, 
characterized in
 that the viscose coating solution is formed by admixing
the said viscose with a food grade cationic polymeric adhering agent for imparting to

said coating cling properties for a meat product packaged therein, and impregnating
the surfaces of said fibrous reinforcement with said coating composition prior to

regeneration. 
The method of claim 6 wherein said viscose coating solution is buffered to a pH in the
range from about 7.5 to about 9.5
