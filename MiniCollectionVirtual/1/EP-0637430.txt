<ABSTRACT>
A sensor probe cover (20) is constituted by two sheets of transparent film (21) and (22) each being of a generally square 
shape and a ring (23) having a hole (23a) suitable for fitting over a sensor probe (12). A hole (21a) is formed in the center of the 

first film (21) and a ring (23) is welded to the peripheral edge of this hole (21a) in the inner surface of the first film (21). The ring 
(23) is formed of a material harder than that of the film. The first film (21) and the second film (22) are hot-welded to each other 

at four corners thereof. The positions of hot welding are designated by reference numerals (20a). The second film (22) is formed 
of a material which can transmit infrared rays therethrough when it is used for a cover of a probe in an infrared ray clinical thermometer. 

When the forward end of the probe (12) is pushed into the ring (23) from above the second film (22), the second film 
(22) covers the probe (12) while the second film (22) is turned over. When the ring (23) is fitted into an annular groove (12a) of the 

probe (12), the mounting of the cover is completed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cover fitted over a
sensor probe, particularly a disposable sanitary (for
the purpose of preventing infection) cover, a method of
manufacturing the cover and a case or stand suitable for
use in order to accommodate the cover or for when the
cover is attached to the probe. In particular this cover is
suitable for a cover fitted over a probe of an infrared thermometer.An infrared thermometer is equipped with a probe
protruding outwardly from part of a case body. The
distal end of the probe is open and is provided
internally with a radiant-energy temperature sensor (a thermopile,
for example). When the tip of the probe is inserted
slightly into the ear canal, heat rays (infrared rays)
emitted from the external ear impinge upon the radiant-energy
temperature sensor. The temperature sensor is connected to a
temperature measurement circuit provided in the case
body. The measurement circuit determines body
temperature based upon the output of the temperature
sensor. Thus, the infrared thermometer is capable of
measuring body temperature in a short period of time
basically without making contact (at least the
temperature sensor does not contact the human body).In order to prevent the transmission of various
diseases, a sanitary cover is fitted over the tip of the 
probe of the infrared thermometer at the time of
temperature measurement. The sanitary cover is replaced
for each individual (patient) subjected to measurement
and is discarded after use.Typical examples of such a cover fitted over the
probe of a speculum which includes an infrared
thermometer are described in USP 4,662,360 and EP-A-419,100.A sanitary cover described in the former comprises
a tubular body and a membrane, which is transparent to
infrared radiation, covering an opening at the tip of
the tubular body. The tubular body is fabricated by
injection molding and the membrane is attached thereto
by thermal welding.The probe cover described in the latter comprises a
sheath fitted on a probe and having a closed distal end
face serving as a window, and a ring attached to a base
end of the sheath by ultrasonic welding and engaged with
the probe. The sheath is produced using a forming
punch.Since both covers comprise two individually
fabricated parts that are combined, the separate parts
are costly and considerable labor is involved in
manufacture. An additional problem is low productivity
since batch treatment is unavoidable, thus making it
impossible to work the covers continuously.The simplest structure is one in which
