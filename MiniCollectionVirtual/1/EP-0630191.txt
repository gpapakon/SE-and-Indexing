<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of providing selenium, in the
form of selenate, in a nutritional product, and to nutritional products which
contain selenate.The element selenium (Se) occurs in four common oxidation states. Two of
these oxidation states, selenite, which is Se (IV), and selenate which is Se
(VI), are believed to be acceptable for use in a nutritional product from a
biochemical and medical perspective. Elemental selenium, Se (0), is not
bioavailable as a source of selenium. Selenite is readily reduced to selenide,
which is Se (II), and elemental selenium, by relatively mild reducing agents such
as glucose, phosphorus acid, and iodide. In contrast, selenate is more difficult
to reduce than selenite and thus, is less likely to form free selenium or
selenides, including hydrogen selenide. This stability of selenate makes a
selenate salt the preferred chemical form for the addition of selenium to a
nutritional product.However, selenite has been employed in nutritional products for the purpose
of adding selenium to nutritional products. The incorporation of sodium selenite
in a premixed combination of ingredients for use in a nutritional product has
created several problems. These problems were manifested by the incomplete
solubility of the premixed combination of ingredients and by a repulsive odor
that emanated from the premixed combination of ingredients. The source of these
problems stemmed from the interactions of sodium selenite with ferrous sulfate
and cupric sulfate. Either or both of these salts, when ground together with
sodium selenite, caused the reduction of sodium selenite to an insoluble reddish 
material, which is believed to be metallic selenium. A repugnant odor emitted
from this mixture is believed to be hydrogen selenide which was formed as a by-product
of the same redox reactions. These problems may be significantly reduced
by using special mixing techniques and/or the use of selenate in a premixed
combination of ingredients for use in a nutritional product.Numerous reports in the literature have examined the bioavailability of
sodium selenite compared to other forms of selenium (sodium selenate,
selenomethionine, selenocysteine). Groce et al, Journal of Animal Science, 33,
1149 (1971) and Olson et al, Poultry Science, 53, 403 (1973) comment upon the
instability of selenite salts in premixed combinations of ingredients for
nutritional products when premixes contain sugars or other organic substances.Shils et al, 22nd Annual Meeting of the American Society for
