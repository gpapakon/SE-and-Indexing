<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a processor circuit having a processor (1) and memory modules (4, 5),   - the memory modules (4, 5) being designed at least in part as DRAMs (5), the memory content of which has to be refreshed again at the latest after a memory holding time, - the refreshing of the memory content only being possible when the processor (1) is not accessing a circuit bus (3).   To ensure that the memory content is refreshed again at the latest after the memory holding time, the circuit has a timer (17), which is activated by the processor (1) in the case of at least some of the accesses of the processor (1) to the circuit bus (3). The timer (17) reports to the processor (1) the elapsing of a waiting time, which is less than or equal to the memory holding time, if the bus access has not yet been completed after expiry of the waiting time. As a result, the processor (1) can break off the bus access, and a refreshing of the memory content of the DRAMs (5) can take place.

Processor circuit arrangement having a
processor (1) and memory modules (4, 5),


wherein the memory modules (4, 5) are designed at
least in part as DRAM's (5), the memory contents

of which must be refreshed at the latest after a
memory holding time,
wherein the processor circuit arrangement has an
interface unit (15) connected to the circuit bus

(3),
wherein the circuit arrangement has a timer (17)
which is activated by the processor (1) for at

least a portion of the instances of access of the
processor (1) to the circuit bus (3),
wherein the timer (17) signals to the processor
(1) that a waiting time which is shorter than or

equal to the memory holding time has expired if
the bus access has not yet terminated at the end

of the waiting time,
wherein in this case the processor (1) can abort
the bus access and the memory contents of the

DRAM's (5) can be refreshed,

   characterised

in that the memory contents can only be refreshed
if the processor (1) is not accessing a circuit

bus (3),
in that the interface unit (15) has memory
elements (19), the output signals of which can be

applied to a system bus (14) by way of blockable
coupling elements (20),
in that when the processor (1) accesses the
interface unit (15) the state of the circuit bus

(3) is written into the memory elements (19) and
the coupling elements (20) are connected through, 

and
in that the contents of the memory elements (19)
are only overwritten the next time the processor

(1) accesses the interface unit (15).
Processor circuit arrangement according to
claim 1, characterised in that the fact that the

waiting time has expired is signalled to the processor
(1) in that the timer (17) applies a control signal to

a control line (18) which is connected to the processor
(1).
Processor circuit arrangement according to
claim 2, characterised in that when a refresh mode is

identified the timer (17) cancels the control signal
and is deactivated.
Processor circuit arrangement according to
claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the processor

(1) repeats the aborted bus access after the memory

contents of the DRAM's (5) have been refreshed.
Processor circuit arrangement according to one
of the above claims, characterised in that the

processor circuit arrangement has standard PC
architecture.
Processor circuit arrangement according to
claim 1, characterised in that the timer (17) is

integrated in the interface unit (15).
Processor circuit arrangement according to
claim 1 to 6, characterised in that the system bus (14)

is designed as a bus with multi-master capability, for
example as an AMS bus or as a VME bus.
Industrial automation system having a
processor circuit arrangement according to one of

claims 1 to 7.
