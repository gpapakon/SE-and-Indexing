<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is related to novel polypeptide 
consisting of 253 amino acids which is produced in a human 

glioblastoma cell line, a method of producing it, DNA encoding the 
said polypeptide, a fragment capable of selectively hybridizing to 

the DNA sequence, a replication or expression vector comprising 
the DNA and a host cell transformed with the replication or 

expression vector. The polypeptide of the present invention may be 
useful for the prevention of or in the treatment of aplasia or 

abnormal proliferation, of glias, neurons or hematopoietic cells, 
depression or enhancement of immunological or neurological 

activity, or tumors or inflammatory diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a novel peptide produced 
by a certain cell line and DNAs encoding it. Cells which constitute a brain may be largely grouped into 
neuron and glia. Neuron plays a main role in the transmission and 
treatment of information in a brain. On the other hand, glia supports the action of neuron. 
Concretely, it is considered that glia is associated with protection 
and support of neuron, formation of myelin sheath, formation of 
blood brain barrier, delivery of nutrition to neuron and metabolism 
of neurotransmitter, and further is associated with the control of 
proliferation and differentiation of neuron when the brain is 
growing, etc. Glia contains various kinds of cells. There are 
astrocytes, oligo-dendrocytes, microglias etc. in central nervous 
system, and Schwann cells, mantle cells etc. in peripheric nervous 
system. Ependymal cells existing in cerebral ventricular 
endothelium belongs to glia. Recently, many humoral factors relating to differentiation, 
proliferation and growth, of neurons and glia, have been found, and 
most of them is generated from glia or tumorous glia (referred as 
glia etc. as a whole hereafter). For example, nerve growth factor (NGF, m.w. ca. 13.5 kd 
(human)), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, m.w. ca. 13.5 kd  
 
(human)), neuroblastoma growth inhibitory factor (NGIF, m.w. ca. 5 
kd (human)) and glia-derived neurotrophic factor (m.w. ca. 500 kd 
and ca. 110 kd (both rats)), which all are known as factors acting 
on neuron, are generated from astrocytes. Further, glia-derived 
glial growth inhibitory factor (GdGGIF, m.w. more than 100 kd 
(rats)) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF, m.w. ca. 32 kd 
(human)), both acting on glia, are also generated from astrocytes. 
Furthermore, glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GdNTF, m.w. ca. 43 
kd (rats)) exhibiting a neurotrophic activity and a proliferating 
activity on glia, glia maturation factor (GMF, m.w. ca. 16.5 kd 
(bovine)) exhibiting a neurotrophic activity and a stimulatory 
activity on proliferation and differentiation of glioblastoma, 
cilially neurotrophic factor (CNTF, m.w. ca. 23 kd (rabbits and 
rats)) exhibiting an activity of life maintenance of ganglion cells, 
an inhibitory activity of proliferation of sympathetic ganglion 
cells, a stimulatory activity of differentiation of sympathetic 
ganglion cells and astrocytes, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF, 
m.w. ca. 16 to 17 kd (human)) exhibiting stimulatory activity of 
proliferation of neurons and astrocytes, all are
