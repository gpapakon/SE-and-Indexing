<ABSTRACT>
A process for production of a bag having linear ribs (7) uses an 
apparatus for forming linear ribs which comprises a plate mold (71) having 

linear protrusions on both faces thereof and upper (72) and lower (73) female 
molds placed at both sides of the mold, having penetrated linear cavities 

at positions corresponding to those of the linear protrusions and capable 
of opening and closing as desired. Multi-layer resin films are inserted 

between the plate mold and the female molds. The molds are heated and 
pressed to each other to prepare multi-layer resin films having linear 

ribs. A bag is produced using the multi-layer resin film having linear 
ribs thus prepared. Ribs convex to the outside can be formed on the 

multi-layer film comprising a layer of a resin having a low melting point 
at the inside and a layer of a resin having a high melting point at an 

outer side thereof. The self-supporting bag produced by the process has a 
higher stiffness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for production of a bag 
according to the preamble of claim 1. A process of such kind is disclosed by EP-A-0 541 821. Bags made of resin films to which the self-supporting property is 
provided by the structure of gazette folding at the bottom have heretofore 
been known. However, the upper part of these bags has lower stiffness even 
though the bottom part has the self-supporting property provided by the 
structure of gazette folding. Particularly when the bag contains a small 
amount of a content, the bag shows inferior stability of the self-supporting 
property, such as bending down of the upper part of the bag. To solve the problem described above, the present inventors already 
proposed a self-supporting bag having higher stability in shape, in which 
a multi-layer resin film containing a resin layer of a high melting point 
and higher toughness is used, a shape having a constriction at the upper 
part of the bag is adopted and ribs are formed at the surface of the film 
for the bag to enhance the self-supporting property EP-A-0 541 821, corresponding to 
International Patent 
Application Laid-Open No. WO 92/21581). The bag made of a multi-layer resin film and having ribs proposed  
 
above uses a material sheet of a multi-layer resin film containing a layer 
of a heat adhesive resin having a low melting point and heat sealing 
property at the inside of the film and a layer of a resin having a high 
melting point and higher toughness at the outside of the film. In this technology, it is difficult to mold the layer of a resin having 
a high melting point in the material sheet of the multi-layer resin film 
into the form of ribs. Thus, ribs are formed on the inner face of the film 
for a bag by varying thickness of the layer of a heat adhesive resin by 
pushing a heated mold against the layer of a heat sealing resin having a 
low melting point while the layer of the resin having a high melting 
point is kept in a flat shape. Because of this situation, the ribs herein are 
formed on the inner side of the bag in a corrugated shape. The rib formed on the inside of a bag in a corrugated shape has a 
shortcoming that the effect of enhancing stability of the shape of a bag is 
insufficient because the shape of the bag is convex to the outside and a 
ridge of a rib protruded to the inside has small resistance to inward 
deformation of the bag. As described above, when a film forming a bag has good stiffness, 
handling of the bag, such as discharge of content and

Process for production of a bag having linear ribs, comprising: 

(1) a process of forming linear ribs (L1,L2) on material sheets (21,22) of a 
multi-layer resin film containing at least an inner layer of a heat adhesive 

resin as a surface layer and an outer layer of a resin with a 
melting point higher than that of the heat adhesive resin, said forming 

process comprising the steps of: 

using an apparatus (7) for forming linear ribs, comprising a plate-shaped 
mold (71) with linear protrusions (76) on its both faces and an 

upper panel (74) placed above the mold (71) and a lower panel (75) 
placed under the mold (71) that are capable of opening and closing as 

desired, respectively; 
placing the material sheets (21,22) in the space between the mold (71)
