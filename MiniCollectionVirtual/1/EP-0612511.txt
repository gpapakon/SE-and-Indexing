<ABSTRACT>
A projection or blade (6a) is provided on the head (6) of the ejection punch (5), which projection or blade (6a) occupies only a part of the thickness of the moulding impression and which is matched to the profile of the hole to be pierced, and a slight axial movement is imparted to the said punch, while the injected material is in the uncompressed state but still at the vulcanisation temperature, in order to cut the membrane of material which is located at the said blade.

Process for manufacturing nipples (8) by means of 
forming inside an openable mould (1 - 2) of the type 

having a mobile ejection plunger (5 - 6), the head (8') 
of the nipples (8) including a puncture of elongate 

profile, characterized in that it consists in giving that 
face of the head (6) of the plunger facing in the direction 

of the mould impression (7 - 7') a projecting cutter 
(6
a
 - 6
b
) established with the profile of the puncture 
which is to be produced, the thickness (
d
) of this cutter 
being smaller than the thickness of the said impression 

in such a way as to form in the latter only a partial 
puncture (8
a
), and in imparting to the plunger, while the 
injected material is in the decompressed state but still 

at the vulcanization temperature, a very slight axial 
movement capable of cutting through the membrane which 

remains at the level of the cutter. 
Apparatus for manufacturing nipples (8) for 
nursing bottles by injecting a vulcanizable material 

inside an openable mould (1 - 2) equipped with a mobile 
ejection plunger (5 - 6), the head (8') of the nipples 

(8) having a puncture (8
a
 - 8
b
) of elongate profile, 
characterized in that that face of the head (6) of the 

plunge facing in the direction of the mould impression 
(7) includes a projecting cutter (6
a
 - 6
b
) which is 
established with the profile of the puncture which is to 

be produced (8
a
 - 8
b
) and which takes up only a part (
d
) 
of the thickness of the mould impression, and in that 

while the injected material is in the decompressed state 
but still at the vulcanization temperature, the said 

plunger is driven with a slight axial movement capable of  
 

cutting through the membrane which is opposite the above-mentioned 
cutter.
