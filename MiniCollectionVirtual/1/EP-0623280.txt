<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle, equipped with the usual spraying equipment and with a control unit for controlling the spray, this unit being placed in the driver's cab, is furthermore equipped, according to the invention, with a control member (8) which compares the current situation of the various elements of the equipment with the normal situation of these elements for an operation prior or subsequent to spraying, this operation being displayed on the control member. The operator is informed by luminous or acoustic signals about the possibility or impossibility of effecting the displayed operation, and is informed of the elements on which he may have to act manually to render this operation possible.

<CLAIMS>
A mobile agricultural spraying implement comprising:

a spray assembly which can be mounted on a carrying vehicle,
self-propelled or towed, and includes at least one spray tank (5), a pump (6)

connected to the spray tank and a fluid circuit comprising sprays and pipes
connecting them to the pump,
a control assembly (4) for monitoring the operation of the
implement during a spraying operation, this control assembly comprising a

control device situated in a driver's cab close to means for controlling the displacements
of the carrying vehicle,
and means for controlling selected operations prior and/or
subsequent to spraying, these means including valves, possibly motors, and

being equipped with means for informing an operator of the situation of these
valves and motors, and
a monitoring member (8) connected to said means, characterized
in that said monitoring member includes a memory capable of storing the

indications of the sensors which must correspond to at least two of said
operations prior or subsequent to spraying, selected from among:


the filling of the spray tank,
the introduction of a treatment product into the spray tank,
the stirring of the contents of the spray tank,
the filling of a rinsing tank,
the rinsing of the spray tank,
the rinsing of the boom
the rinsing of the spray fluid circuit,
means for displaying the nature of the operation which the operator
wishes to execute, and 
means for informing the operator as to the agreement between the
current indications from the sensors and the indications stored in memory and

corresponding to the operation displayed.
The implement of claim 1, characterized in that said display and
information means are grouped together into a monitoring casing.
The implement of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the display
and information means are placed outside the driver's cab.
The implement of any one of claims 1-3, characterized in that said
monitoring member is capable of remotely controlling at least some of said

motors and said valves,

said monitoring member includes a memory capable of storing
sequences of actions corresponding to at least one of said operations prior or

subsequent to spraying,
said monitoring member is capable of controlling at least some of
said sequences of actions as a function of an order received and of the

indications of said sensors, and
said monitoring member furthermore comprises a control casing,
provided with means allowing an operator to order a programmed operation,

and means for informing the operator of the progress of the operation and/or
for signalling an anomaly to him.
The implement of claims 2 and 4, characterized in that the control
casing and the monitoring casing are merged.
The implement of one of claims 4 and 5, characterized in that the
monitoring member is capable of controlling at least one operation from the

following:

filling the spray tank by transfer of liquid from outside,
introducing a treatment product into the spray tank, 
stirring the contents of the spray tank,
rinsing one element of those of the spray assembly: tank, pump,
sprays, fluid circuit, filters,
transfer of rinsing liquid from the rinsing tank to the elements of the
spray assembly and in the opposite direction,
transferring liquid from an element of the spray assembly to
outside.
The implement of claim 6, characterized in that the monitoring
member is furthermore capable of controlling a transfer of liquid between two

points outside the implement.
The implement of one of claims 1-7, characterized in that the
monitoring member includes a programmable timer capable of controlling the

automatic follow-on of some operations.
