<ABSTRACT>
Electronic components, chips, are moulded in a 
single-strip moulding apparatus. The products to be moulded 

are placed in a mould consisting of two halves, one of the 
halves whereof displays recesses for receiving a component, 

which half is connected via a channel with a cavity for 
receiving a quantity of moulding material. The mould halves 

are closed relative to one another by an angle lever system.

<DESCRIPTION>
For the moulding of electronic components, chips, 
moulding apparatus are used wherein a so-called leadframe is 
placed into a mould wherein the mould displays recesses for 
receiving the parts for moulding, and in addition cavities 
are arranged in the mould wherein measured quantities of 
moulding material are placed and wherein by supplying heat 
and exerting pressure in these cavities the moulding 
material becomes liquid, moves via channels intended for 
that purpose to the parts for moulding and, curing there, 
encapsulates the leadframe. The leadframe is subsequently 
removed from the moulding apparatus and subjected to further 
processing. The object of the invention is to provide a 
single-strip moulding apparatus which combines a simple 
construction with a relatively high production rate. This is achieved according to the invention by 
providing a single-strip moulding apparatus comprising a 
mould die formed by two mould halves movable relative to one 
another and closable onto one another, means for placing a 
leadframe into one of the mould halves, means for carrying 
moulding material into cavities of the mould, means for 
exerting pressure in these cavities, means for heating the 
mould halves, means for cleaning the mould halves and means 
for removing a moulded product from the mould, wherein the 
mould halves are closed relative to one another by an angle  
 
lever system connected to one of the mould halves and driven 
by an electromotor and a screwed rod. The required closing 
force to be exerted on the mould halves is transmitted in a 
suitable manner by the angle lever system since this exerts 
great force especially at the end of the stroke. As first alternative embodiment the mould halves 
can be moved relative to one another using a control 
mechanism consisting of a pneumatic cylinder which effects 
the largest part of the stroke and a piston-cylinder unit 
having multiple pistons placed on the piston rod for 
providing by pneumatic means the final necessary closing 
force. As second alternative embodiment the mould halves 
can be moved relative to one another using a control 
mechanism consisting of at least one pneumatic cylinder 
which effects the largest part of the stroke and a closed 
piston-diaphragm cylinder unit filled with liquid for 
converting pneumatic pressure into hydraulic pressure for 
providing the final necessary closing force.  The invention will be further elucidated with reference 
to the drawings. In the drawings: 
figures 1-3 show schematically one
