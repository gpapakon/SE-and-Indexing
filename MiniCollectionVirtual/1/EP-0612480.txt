<ABSTRACT>
A dry coating composition for imparting the 
texture, taste and appearance of batter fried foods to 

baked foodstuffs comprising 10 to 50% by weight 
binding agents, the binding agents containing egg 

white solids and gelatin, and 15 to 70% by weight 
bulking agents, the bulking agents containing prefried 

crumbs and/or cereal crumbs or fines. A well 
balanced proportion of egg white solids and gelatin 

provides a uniform, continuous, cohesive film that 
closely resembles the inner layer of a batter fried 

product and acts as a binder for the other coating 
ingredients to help retain moisture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to edible food coatings and 
more particularly is directed to dry coating 
compositions which are to be applied to the food prior 
to baking and which produce a batter fried appearance, 
texture and taste to the oven baked food. Many foods such as seafood, meats and vegetables 
are prepared by first coating the food with a batter 
consisting essentially of flour, milk, eggs and 
seasoning. The batter coated food is then typically 
breaded with a light coating of flour and/or breadcrumbs 
and then fried by pan frying or deep fat frying. The 
fried batter coated food is enjoyed by consumers because 
the coating has a golden brown color and a soft crunchy 
texture that separates from the meat during eating 
resulting in a very tasty, greasy mouth feel. However, 
consumers also typically prefer the ease and simplicity 
of conventional baking as an alternative to frying. The 
messiness involved with the preparation of fried foods, 
the ever present danger of spattering oil, and the 
unfavorable dietary aspects associated with fried foods  
 
have led to the development of coatings which attempt 
to impart a fried appearance to foodstuffs which are 
baked and yet retain the appealing color, taste and 
texture associated with fried foods. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,496,601 to Rispoli et al. and 
4,208,442 to Evans et al. disclose dry coating 
formulations which are useful to provide a fried 
appearance, taste and texture to baked comestibles. 
While each of these patents represents an advance in 
the art, they do not disclose a dry coating 
composition that imparts the appearance, texture and 
taste of batter fried comestibles to oven baked 
comestibles. Rispoli et al. discloses the use of a 
pre-fried batter component, which is flour-based being 
10 to 50% by weight of the composition, a bread crumb 
component being from 17 to 35% of the composition, a 
starch component being from 10 to 30% of the 
composition and a film forming agent being from 1.5 to 
30% of the composition. The film forming agent may be 
a protein such as gelatin or egg albumin. Evans et al. discloses a dry coating composition 
having 60 to 78% of bulking agents which includes 
bread crumbs or cereal fines, a protein such as egg 
albumin or gelatin or other proteins, and flour. The 
composition also includes from 4 to 13% binding agents 
such as starch or dextrin. The Evans composition is 
made by first preparing a premix that includes all of 
the flour, a portion of the protein and a portion of 
the binding agents, mixing
