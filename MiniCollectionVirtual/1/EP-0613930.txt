<ABSTRACT>
New coloured (green) inorganic pigments which are characterised in that they include mixed oxides corresponding to the formula R2MxM'yO5 in which R denotes at least one element taken from the group consisting of yttrium and the rare earths of atomic numbers between 62 and 71 inclusive, M and M' are identical or different and denote at least one element chosen from metallic elements exhibiting at least one valency state +2, and x and y are two numbers, preferably integers, whose sum is equal to 2. Process for obtaining these pigments, which consists (i) in preparing a mixture, preferably aqueous, containing soluble salts of the elements R, M and M' in the required stoichiometric proportions, (ii) in drying the mixture obtained, and then (iii) in calcining the dried product and finally, optionally, (iv) in grinding and/or disintegrating the calcined product. Finally, use of the said pigments for colouring various materials such as plastics, ceramics and others.
