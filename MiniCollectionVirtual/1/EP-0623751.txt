<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a non-return valve (check valve) for a discharge pipe (outlet pipe) (5) of a pump (2) opening into a container (7), the discharge pipe (5) and running essentially vertically upwards. Placed in an inverted position over the outlet orifice (6) of the discharge pipe (5) there is a bell-shaped hood (9), thus forming a low-loss siphon.

A pump with a reverse flow preventing means on the 
outlet tube of the pump (2), an essentially vertically 

arranged outlet tube (5) opening into a container (3) for the 
material to be pumped, said outlet tube having said material 

flowing therethrough from the bottom to the top, same having 
a siphon-like outlet, characterized in that a bell-shaped cap 

(9) is slipped over the outlet opening (6) of the outlet tube 
(5) and in that one or more ventilating devices (10) are 

connected with the outlet tube (5) and/or with the cap (9). 
The pump as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the bell-like cap (9) is arranged with an axial offset in 

relation to the outlet tube (5). 
The pump as claimed in claim 1 or in claim 2, 
characterized in that the ventilating device (10) is designed 

in the form of a controlled device or a device able to be 
influenced by the material to be pumped. 
The pump as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the ventilating device (10) is able to be monitored by the 

electrical and/or mechanical behavior of the pump drive 
motor. 
The pump as claimed in any one or more of the claims 
1 through 4, characterized in that as a ventilating device 

(10) softly sealing fittings are utilized. 
The pump as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the ventilating device (10) is designed in the form of an 

open tube, whose lowermost opening (11) is within the outlet 
tube (5) and whose topmost opening (12) is above the maximum 

liquid level (8) . 
The pump as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the tubular ventilating device is secured on the cap (9) in a 

vertically adjustable manner.
