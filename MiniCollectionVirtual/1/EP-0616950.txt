Folding box made of a strong packing material, 
such as paperboard, for packaging elongate articles, 

having two parallel broad side walls and having two 
parallel narrow side walls which connect the latter, the 

side walls together forming a sleeve, having closure 
flaps which close the end sides of the sleeve and are 

articulated at the free ends of the side walls, and 
having an insert which is fastened in the sleeve, bears 

the articles, is likewise produced by folding strong 
packing material and has two spaced-apart guide walls and 

a web connecting the latter to one another, characterized 
in that the guide walls (31, 32) and the web (38) extend 

in an axis-parallel manner with respect to the end sides 
of the sleeve, in that the guide walls (31, 32) are 

adhesively bonded on one (12) of the broad side walls 
(11, 12) by means of foot strips (35, 36) which adjoin 

the guide walls at one end, and in that the web (38), 
which is connected to the other end of the guide walls 

(31, 32), is arranged at a certain distance from the 
other broad side wall (11), with the result that a 

compartment (40) for an enclosure leaflet (41) is formed 
between the web and the other broad side wall (11). 
Folding box according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that one (35) of the foot strips (35, 36) of the guide 

walls (31, 32) is connected integrally to one end of 
one (12) of the broad side walls (11, 12) in the region 

of one end side of the sleeve. 
Folding box according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that one foot strip (35) on that end side of the  

 
sleeve which forms a removal opening is articulated on 

one broad side wall (12), and in that a closure flap (21) 
with an insertion flap (22) is articulated on the other 

broad side wall (11) in the region of the removal 
opening. 
Folding box according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the foot strip (35) which is connected to one 

broad side wall (12) is wider than the foot strip (36) on 
the other guide wall (32). 
Folding box according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the guide walls (31, 32) extend in 

planes which are parallel to the end sides of the sleeve. 
Folding box according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that, moreover, a cover flap (25) is 

articulated at that end of the broad side wall (12) on 
which the foot strip (35) is articulated, which cover 

flap is cut out of the foot strip and is folded over, and 
adhesively bonded, onto the outside of the closure 

flap (21) which closes the opening. 
Folding box according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the two guide walls (31, 32) have 

through-passages (33) which are aligned with one another 
and receive the articles. 
Folding box according to Claim 7, characterized
