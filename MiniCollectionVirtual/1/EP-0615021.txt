<ABSTRACT>
The lifting device is suitable for lifting a block of material (21,23), such as 
a kerbstone, and comprises contact means (15,25,26) arranged to be located under a contact 

portion of the block such that the block rests on the contact means during lifting. The 
contact means is connected to a handle (10) which may be gripped by a user for lifting the 

block. Typically, the device comprises a frame (1), typically of welded metal construction, 
connecting the handle and contact means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lifting device, and in particular to a lifting 
device to aid in lifting an elongate block of material such as a kerbstone or the like. Devices intended to aid in the lifting and placement of heavy blocks, such as 
kerbstones or the like are known. Known devices are relatively complex (such as that shown 
in, for example, U.S. Patent 4545609) or grip longitudinally opposed ends of the block 
making it difficult to lay kerbstones or slabs in end to end relationship (such as the devices 
shown in French Patent Specification 2611771 and British Patent Specification 645790). In 
the devices referred to lifting force on the block is applied via calliper type actuators acting 
on opposed sides of the block. This is inherently unsafe. Furthermore, prior art devices 
often require the application of mechanical force to grip and support the blocks during lifting. 
For example U.S. Patent 4808062 discloses a complex mechanical device having calliper like 
grippers which use a hydraulic actuator to hold themselves in a gripping orientation for lifting 
rocks. An improved lifting device has now been devised. According to the invention, there is provided a lifting device for lifting a block 
of material, which device comprises contact means arranged to be located under a contact 
portion of the block, and handle means spaced from the contact means and arranged to be 
gripped by a user to lift the device, the contact means being connected to the handle means 
such that when said device is lifted by the handle means the block can be lifted with said 
device with the block resting on the contact means. It is preferred that the contact means is arranged to be located beneath the 
block. In certain embodiments the contact means may either comprise an element arranged 
to be located in a receiving recess in the block; in other embodiments the contact means may 
be arranged to be located under a formation projecting outwardly from a surface of the 
block.  The lifting device is in effect a hand tool, in which the weight of the block is 
transmitted to the handle means, the device and block being lifted in unison by the handle 
means. Preferably the handle means is connected to the contact means by frame means 
comprising at least one frame element. Desirably, the contact means is arranged to extend 
substantially perpendicularly from a frame element. It is preferred that the handle means is pivotally connected to the frame means; 
advantageously the handle means may be connected to the
