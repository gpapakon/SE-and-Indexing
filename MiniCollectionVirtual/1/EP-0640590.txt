<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
synthesis of certain 4-mercaptophenols and naphthalenols which 
are intermediates for preparing unsymmetrical dithiol ketals 
composed of a farnesyl mercaptan unit and a thiol phenol 
moiety. The latter compounds are useful in the treatment or 
prevention of hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and 
artherosclerosis. Unsymmetrical dithiol ketals composed of a farnesyl 
mercaptan unit and a thiol phenol moiety are unknown in the 
literature. However, examples of similar symmetrical diaryl 
dithiol ketals are abundant. (Newworth and Laufer, J. Med. 
Chem, 170, 13(4), 722). An example of a known symmetrical diaryl dithiol ketal 
is Probucol (4,4'-(isopropyledevedithio)bis(2,6-di-tert-butylphenol). 
Probucol is a potent synthetic hypolipidemic 
agent effective in human at dosage around 500 mg b.i.d. The 
mechanism of action of this symmetrical diaryl dithiol ketal 
has been a subject of debate for many years. It has 
recently been suggested that the antioxidation properties of 
Probucol is responsible for its therapeutic actions  
 
(Minakami et. al., Drug Res. 1989, 39(II), 1090). Dithiol 
ketals are hydrolysed to give reductive intermediates which 
are capable of neutralizing any harmful oxidative products 
such as hydroxyl radical. The precise mechanism of how the 
reductive species are released is still unclear as is the 
interaction with the oxidizing toxic substances. Being a 
highly lipophilic compound, Probucol (or any other non-polar 
substance) is transported into plasma in lipoproteins, 
primarily in LDL and VLDL (Marshall, F.N., Artery, 1982, 10, 
7), and is preferentially distributed in high concentrations 
in cell membranes which consist of phospholipids. Thus, it 
is strategically positioned to offer maximum protective 
action against oxidative modifications to the lipoproteins 
and cell membranes. The unsymmetrical dithiol ketals act not only as 
antioxidants, but also as potential biofeedback regulators. 
They are also capable of down regulating the crucial 
hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCo-A reductase) 
and, therefore, are more desirable for the treatment of 
hypolipidemia.  Figure 1 shows the schematic preparation of the dithiol 
ketal compounds. Figure 2 shows a general procedure for the preparation of 
arylthiols. Figure 3 shows a general procedure for the preparation of 
arylthiols. Figure 4 shows the schematic procedure for preparing the 
prodrug of an ester. Figure 5 shows the schematic procedure for preparing
