<ABSTRACT>
The protective body (14) is arrange crossways to the key channel (9), is rod-shaped, connected with the core (2), has a through hole running orthogonally to the core longitudinal axis and engages through the key channel (9) in the area of the key point (12,13). In the area of the deepest part of the key channel (8) adjacent to the key point (12,13) an indexing pin (16) opposite to the key back (10) is arranged. The protective body (14) has a circular round cross-section and is held in the hole under tension. The end-side top of the protective body is arranged in the hole set back from the cover surface of the core (5). The indexing pin (16) is spring-located and can be pressed back into the opening position by the key back (10).

Combination of a flat key (8) and a cylinder lock with tumbler pins (3, 4), 
with a cylinder housing (1), in which a core (2) of cylindrical cross-section 

with longitudinal profile or longitudinal ribbed profile is rotatably located in 
the key channel (9) for a flat key (8) provided on the narrow side with 

variable notches (7), and with spring-loaded tumbler pins (3, 4) extending at 
right angles to the core longitudinal axis (43), which former are arranged in 

each case in a row or in rows arranged on planes, which for example are 
arranged parallel to the centre axis of the core (2) and which comprise at 

least one core pin (5), opposite to which lie the matching notches (7) and 
recesses in the flat key (8), where the key back (10) is tangent to the core 

circumference, where a locking slide (21) is actuatable by the end section 
of the flat key (8), which former controls at least one core pin (5) locking the 

core (2) to prevent rotation where, in the recess of the key channel (9) 
corresponding to the area of the key tip (12, 13), a protecting element (14) 

is present in the key channel (9), which element is surrounded by the flat 
key (8) with a longitudinal matching slot (11), such that the longitudinal slot 

(11) exits at the key tip, where the transverse dimensions of the longitudinal 
slot are designed so that the flat key (8) with the two key tips (12, 13) so 

formed surrounds the protecting element (14) arranged at right angles to 
the key channel (9) with minimum play on opposite side, and that the 

protecting element (14) connected to the core (2) is of rod-shaped design,

(10) in open position, where the longitudinal axis of the indexing pin (16) is 
perpendicular to the core longitudinal axis and perpendicular to the 

longitudinal axis of the bar-shaped protecting element (14), as well as  
 

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the key (9), and that the locking 
slide (21) is subjected to load in axial direction of the core (2) by spring 

pressure towards the flat key (8) and that the locking slide (21) possesses a 
control lug (28) which, when the cylinder lock is operated with the 

corresponding flat key (8), can be pushed back by it in opposition to the 
spring pressure and which with a control face (29) in the form of a stop face 

controls the corresponding core pin (5), lockable by the locking slide (21), 
in open position, where the locking slide (21) is of T-shaped design with a

spring which exerts pressure on it.  
 
Combination of a cylinder lock and a flat key (8) in accordance with Claim 1 
or one of the subsequent Claims,
