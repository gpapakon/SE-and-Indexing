<ABSTRACT>
A solid phase extraction device has a solvent-compatible 
permeable membrane with a bubble point greater than the normal 

operating pressure differential used and a sorbent material 
retained by two disks or frits so that when pressure is applied, 

the sample to be processed will pass through the membrane, but the 
membrane will not permit air to pass therethrough, and the sorbent 

remains wet throughout the process. The device has an input port 
and an output port and operates to maintain a pressure differential 

between the ports. Sorbent material is entrapped between two disks 
or frits. Located above the sorbent material is a support having 

a grid surface. The support prevents the frit from "riding up" the 
column of the barrel. Ultrasonically welded to the support is a 

solvent-compatible permeable membrane. The membrane is 
hermetically sealed to the support and the support is self-locked 

to the interior barrel of the device. When wetted, the membrane 
allows for the passage of matter, but prevents air from passing 

therethrough to the sorbent material. The sorbent material remains 
wet. With the sorbent material retained by the frits, the sorbent 

material will not escape to contaminate the filtrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid phase extraction device. In 
particular, it pertains to a device for improving the sample 
processing, having a membrane with a bubble point greater than the 
normal operating pressure differential used, and having a sorbent 
material entrapped within two disks or frits so that when pressure 
is applied, air does not pass through the membrane, and the sorbent 
material remains wet until it is desired to remove the liquid from 
the sorbent, at which time a differential pressure greater than the 
bubble point of the membrane is used. U.S. Patent No. 4,138,474 relates to a device for 
immunological determinations including a housing carrying sorbent 
material in the form of gel particles and a porous barrier 
enclosing the gel particles. The barrier is located upstream from 
the sorbent and is in the form of a nylon fabric or net having 
openings which do not permit passage of the gel particles. Liquid 
is drawn into the syringe in an amount to fill the volume below the 
barrier and preferably in an amount to at least cover the net. U.S. Patent No. 5,139,031 relates to a staged filtration 
device for cytology and microbiological testing. Membrane filters 
having different porosity are placed in stackable containers. The  
 
membrane filters are made of cellulose or polycarbonate. Cell 
suspension is collected on the membrane. No sorbent is involved in 
the filtration device. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,891,134 and 4,990,253 relate to a sample 
filtration device employing differential pressure. Filter media 
are disposed near one end and retained within the core of the 
hollow plunger by friction means. The filter media include paper, 
glass fiber, cellulose, and nitrocellulose, the preferred media 
being fiberglass combined with polypropylene. Depth filters are 
generally preferred over membrane filters. No sorbent is involved 
in the filtration device. U.S. Patent No. 4,923,680 relates to a device containing a 
time-delay filter, particularly useful in immunoassay. The filter 
is positioned between an upper and a lower compartment. The filter 
comprising the membrane has pores which retain agglutinated or 
complexed materials on the filter but which allow fluids and 
unagglutinized materials to pass through. The filter is 
constructed from glass, ceramics, fibers, or synthetic and natural 
polymers, the preferred material being cellulose esters, 
polyamides, and polyesters. The filter is overcoated with at least 
one water-soluble protein or carbohydrate. U.S. Patent No. 4,131,544
