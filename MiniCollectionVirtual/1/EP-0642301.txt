<ABSTRACT>
Fixed-dried human blood platelets and processes for preparing the same are disclosed. The platelets, upon reconstitution: adhere to thrombogenic surfaces; do not adhere to non-thrombogenic surfaces; undergo shape change (spreading) upon adhering to a thrombogenic surface; adhere to one another to form a hemostatic plug upon adhering to a thrombogenic surface; and release their granular contents. Pharmaceutical formulations containing the same are also disclosed. The platelets are preferably fixed by means of a fixative such as formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, or glutaraldehyde, or fixed by means of a permanganate fixate. The platelets are preferably dried by lyophilization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgical aid
comprising fixed-dried blood platelets suitable for
administration to human patients.The use of platelet concentrates in transfusion
medicine has become well established during the past thirty
years. However, the rapid loss or platelet function during
the storage period and risk of bacterial contamination has
greatly complicated management of an effective inventory of
platelet concentrates in blood banks. In many settings,
the limited shelf life of platelet concentrates has
drastically reduced their usage. E. Klein et al., J. Pediatrics49, 517-522 (1956),
described the preparation and administration of lyophilized
platelet material to children with acute leukemia and
aplastic anemia. Pain and venospasm at the site of
infusion were noted. The limited effectiveness of these
materials is shown in Table 2 therein. After more than
thirty years, these materials have not led to a useful
therapeutic treatment.In order to make platelet transfusion therapy more
manageable for blood banks, there has been considerable
interest in devising means for diminishing or delaying the
loss of platelet function during the storage period. One
approach has been in the context of the development of
plasma-free storage media. See, e.g., S. Holme, U.S.
Patent No. 4,695,460. Another approach has been to employ
biochemical techniques to stabilize the platelets. See,
e.g., A. Bode et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,994,367. While
these techniques provide useful extension of shelf life,
they do not provide a shelf life extended for prolonged
periods of time. Finally, the preparation of platelet
membrane microvesicles from, among other things, outdated
platelets is described in F. Chao, U.S. Patent No.
5,185,160.Fixed-dried blood platelets for use in diagnostic
assays are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,287,087 to
Brinkhous et al. While such fixed-dried platelet
preparations can be stored for prolonged periods of time
for diagnostic purposes, they have not heretofore been
provided in a form for human pharmaceutical use. Blood
platelets have also been fixed-dried by Bode et al (Arthur
P. Bode, Marjorie S. Read, Robert L. Reddick, Stein Hole
and W. Andrew Heaton, "Evaluation of Dried Storage of
Platelets and RBC for Transfusion: Lyophilization and other
Dehydration Techniques", Second Annual Report from the
Office for Naval Research: Navy Medical Research and
Development Command, Department of Navy (march 1991)). However, there
was no investigation as to their use in surgical aids.
Accordingly,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A surgical aid, comprising, in combination

   a solid, physiologically acceptable substrate; and

   fixed, dried blood platelets carried by said substrate
material, wherein said platelets, upon reconsitution:


adhere to thrombogenic surfaces;
do not adhere to non-thrombogenic surfaces;
undergo shape change (spreading) upon adhering to a
thrombogenic surface;
adhere to one another to form a hemostatic plug upon
adhering to a thrombogenic surface; and
release their granular contents; and
wherein said platelets express platelet-derived growth factor on

the surface thereof.
A surgical aid according to claim 1, wherein said substrate
is selected from the group consisting of wound dressings,

sutures, fabrics, and prosthetic devices.
A surgical aid according to claim 1, wherein said surgical
aid is sterile, and wherein said surgical aid is packaged in a

sterile container.
