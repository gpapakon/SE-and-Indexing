<ABSTRACT>
Milled carbon fibers are provided which have a fiber 
cut surface and a fiber axis intersecting with each other 

at cross angles, the smaller one thereof being at least 65° 
on the average. The milled carbon fibers may have a 

specific surface area as measured by the BET method of 0.2 
to 10 m²/g. The milled carbon fibers may be obtained by a 

process comprising melt spinning of mesophase pitch, 
infusibilization, milling of the infusibilized pitch fibers 

as obtained or after a primary heat treatment at low 
temperatures in an inert gas and a high-temperature heat 

treatment in an inert gas. Even when the graphite layer 
plane has achieved high-level growth, the above milled 

carbon fibers have low reactivity with a metal of high 
temperature or the like during the molding or use thereof 

because the proportion of reactive exposed surface of the 
inner portion of the fiber is small, so that the use of the 

milled carbon fibers can improve the mechanical strength 
and high-temperature heat resistance of the composite 

material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to milled carbon fibers.
More particularly, the present invention is concerned with
milled carbon fibers which have a large surface area
available for e.g. contact with metals, so that they are
suitable for improving the rigidity and high-temperature
heat resistance of e.g. metals and alloys, thereby
ensuring advantageous utilization thereof in, for example,
carbon-fiber-reinforced composite materials. Also, the
present invention is concerned with a process for producing
the milled carbon fiber.Carbon fibers are lightweight and have high strength
and rigidity, so that in recent years they are utilized in a
wide spectrum of fields from the aerospace and aircraft
industry to the general industries.For example, carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics are
actually widely utilized as structural materials having
high specific strength and specific modulus of elasticity.
Further, carbon-fiber-reinforced metals (CFRM), such as
carbon-fiber-reinforced aluminum alloys and carbon-fiber-reinforced
magnesium alloys (hereinafter referred to as
"CFRAl(Mg)"), have been developed as materials having 
excellent high-temperature dimensional stability and
thermal deformation resistance, and their use is
anticipated as a material for use in structural members for
aerospace and aircraft and engine members for vehicles.However, the production of CFRAl(Mg) has encountered,
for example, a problem such that not only is the
wettability of the carbon fiber with molten Al (or Mg) poor
but also, once the wetting is effected, the carbon fiber
reacts with Al to thereby form Al4C3 with the result that
the strength of the material is lowered.The amount of formed Al4C3 is connected with the type
of the carbon fiber. That is, the carbon fiber produced by
heat treating at a temperature of about 2000°C, known as
"graphitized carbon fiber", has a high carbon
crystallization degree and a strong carbon-to-carbon bond
to render itself stable, as compared with the carbon fiber
produced by heat treating at a temperature of about 1500°C,
known as "carbonized carbon fiber", so that the reactivity
with e.g. molten Al alloy is poor, thereby
minimizing the formation of carbides, such as aluminum
carbide.Therefore, the mechanical properties of the CFRAl(Mg)
are superior when the graphitized carbon fiber is used as
reinforcement.The graphite crystals of the graphitized carbon fiber
are generally highly anisotropic from the dynamical,
electrical and scientific viewpoints, because the carbons 
interact each other between the
