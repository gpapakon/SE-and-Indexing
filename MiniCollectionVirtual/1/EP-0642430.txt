A hydraulic unit including a hydraulic pump (9), driven by 
a camshaft of an internal combustion engine, for the supply 

of engine-compartment consumers in automotive vehicles, the 
suction side of the hydraulic pump (9) being connected to 

an intermediate reservoir (7) with an unrestricted overflow 
tank (8), into which operating medium from the lubrication 

system is supplied by the lubrication pressure pump (2) of 
the internal combustion engine,
 
characterized in that the hydraulic pump (9) is an externally 

pressurized radial piston pump that is internally 
driven by the camshaft accommodated in the cylinder head 

(27) and includes at least one pump piston (24), the cylinder 
head (27) of the internal combustion engine being 

formed as pump housing. 
A hydraulic unit as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the radial piston pump is driven by a 

specially configured free end of the camshaft (33). 
A hydraulic unit as claimed in claim 2,
 
characterized in that the free end of the camshaft (33) is 

provided with an eccentric (26) on which a ball race (25) 
is rotatably mounted, the pump piston(s) (24) being supported 

on the ball race (25). 
A hydraulic unit as claimed in anyone of the claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that the camshaft (33) is mounted in a  

 
bearing (22) in the cylinder head wall (17). 
A hydraulic unit as claimed in anyone of the claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that the camshaft (33) is mounted in the 

cylinder head (27), and the mounting support takes up 
forces which are exerted on the camshaft by the hydraulic 

pump. 
A hydraulic unit as claimed in claim 3,
 
characterized in that an opening (18) leading to the 

cylinder head (27) is provided in the cylinder head wall 
(17), through which the free end of the camshaft (33) extends, 

in that the opening (18) is succeeded by a hollow 
space (16) accommodating the ball race (25) and the eccentric 

(26), in that the cylinder head wall (17) contains 
at least one cylinder bore (23) in which each one piston 

(24) is guided, and in that a suction channel (28) and a 
pressure channel (31) extend through the cylinder head wall 

(17). 
A hydraulic unit as claimed in claim 6,
 
characterized in that the hollow space (16) is closed by a 

cover (37).  
 
A hydraulic unit as claimed in claim 7,
 
characterized in that part of the suction channel (28) is 

provided in the cover (37), and in that restrictors (13) 
are provided in the cover (37). 
A hydraulic unit as claimed in claim 8,
 
characterized in that the cover (37) is of round shape 

in its fringe area, that it includes a circumferential 

annular groove (32), in that at least one bore extends 
from the side of the cover close to the cylinder head 

wall (17) to the circumferential annular groove (32), and 
in that a recess (35) is provided in the middle of the 

side of the cover (37) close to the cylinder head. 
A hydraulic unit as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that the intermediate reservoir (7) is 

incorporated in the cylinder head wall (17). 
A hydraulic unit as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterized in that the hydraulic pump (9) serves for 

the supply of either a camshaft adjusting device, an 
automatic clutch, a differential lock, a slip control 

system or a power steering system, or even a plurality of 
such consumers at the same time.
