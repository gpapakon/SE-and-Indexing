<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning apparatus for a printing press 
includes a cleaning unit (5), apparatus frames (4), a locking 

member (18), and air cylinders (35). The cleaning unit has a 
supply roll (21) on which a web for cleaning a 

cylinder/roller is wound and a take-up roll (22) for taking 
up the web drawn from the supply roll, and rotatably 

supports the supply and take-up rolls. The apparatus 
frames detachably support the cleaning unit. The 

locking member fixes and holds the cleaning unit on the 

apparatus frames. The air cylinders are fixed on the 
apparatus frames and rotate the take-up roll in a 

direction to take up the web.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cleaning
apparatus for various types of printing presses, which
cleans the printing cylinders, e.g., a blanket cylinder
and an impression cylinder, and rollers, e.g., a form
roller and a vibrating roller.Various types of printing presses, e.g., an
offset printing press and an intaglio printing press,
have printing cylinders, e.g., a plate cylinder, a
blanket cylinder, and an impression cylinder, and
rollers, e.g., a form roller and a vibrating roller.
During printing, foreign matters, e.g., ink dust and
paper dust attach to the circumferential surfaces of
these printing cylinders and rollers to degrade the
quality of printed matter. Hence, the printing press is
provided with a cleaning apparatus for removing these
foreign matters.The cleaning apparatus of this type has a
supply roll and a take-up roll. The supply and take-up
rolls extend in the axial direction of a printing
cylinder to be cleaned, e.g., the blanket cylinder, to
be close to its circumferential surface. Each roll has
two end portions rotatably supported by the bearings of 
the frame. A belt-like cleaning web (to be merely
referred to as a web hereinafter) constituted by an
unwoven fabric or the like is wound on the supply roll.
The web is drawn from the supply roll by rotating the
take-up roll with a drive unit, pressed against the
circumferential surface of the blanket cylinder with a
guide roller or a pad provided between the supply and
take-up rolls, and taken up by the take-up roll.With this arrangement, when the blanket
cylinder is rotated and the take-up roll is
intermittently rotated to intermittently drive the web,
the foreign matters attaching to the circumferential
surface of the blanket cylinder are wiped with the web
and transferred to the web. The web after the wiping
operation is taken up by the take-up roll with the
foreign matters attaching to it.When the ink roller is to be cleaned, for
example, a cleaning apparatus for scraping the foreign
matters attaching to the circumferential surface of the
ink roller with a doctor is employed. More
specifically, in a cleaning state, the doctor is
obliquely provided between the supply and take-up rolls
with its distal end facing upward. The doctor is
separated from the circumferential surface of the ink
roller, so that its proximal end portion is brought into
contact with the web traveling from the supply roll to 
the take-up roll and that its distal end opposes to
contact the circumferential surface of the ink roller.With this arrangement, after

<CLAIMS>
A cleaning apparatus for a printing press, comprising:

a cleaning unit, having a supply roll on which a
web for cleaning a cylinder/roller is wound and

a take-up roll for taking up said web drawn from
said supply roll, for rotatably supporting said

supply and take-up rolls;
a frame for detachably supporting said cleaning
unit;
holding means for fixing and holding said cleaning
unit on said frame; and
driving means, fixed on said frame, for rotating
said take-up roll in a direction to take up said

web;
transmitting means, separably coupled to said
driving means, for transmitting a drive force of

said driving means fixed to said frame to said
take-up roll of said cleaning unit,
characterized in that said driving means have a
rod member which reciprocates and that said

transmitting means comprise a pin with which a
distal end of said rod member is brought into

contact, a lever on which said pin is provided
to extend therefrom and which is pivoted through

a predetermined angle together with said pin
when said rod member is moved forward, a spring

for biasing said lever to pivot in a direction
to retract said rod member, and a one-way clutch

for transmitting, to said take up roll, a pivotal 
movement of said lever in only one direction

to take up said web.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that said holding means comprises a stopper

member, and said cleaning unit is selectively
moved between a mounting position for holding

said cleaning unit on said frame in a mounted
state, and an escape position for mounting and

removing said cleaning unit on and from said
frame, said apparatus further comprising a lock

member for locking said stopper member when said
cleaning unit is at the mounting position.
An apparatus according to claim 2, characterized
in that said stopper member comprises a stepped

plate piece pivotally provided to said frame and
engageable with a plate-like member of said

cleaning unit, and said lock member comprises a
set screw for axially pivotally supporting said

plate piece and clamping said plate piece while
said set screw is engaged with said plate-like

member of said cleaning unit.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that said cleaning unit comprises a pair of

right and left brackets and stays for coupling
said brackets with each other, and said frame

supports at least lower end faces of said brakkets.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that it further comprises a stopper for regulating

a pivot limit of said lever in a direction
to retract said rod member of said driving 

means, thereby releasing a contact state of said
distal end of said rod member and said pin.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that said supply and take-up rolls respectively

have shaft assemblies on which said web is
wound, an
d said cleaning unit detachably supports
two ends of said respective shaft assemblies.
An apparatus according to claim 6, characterized

said holders, and the first recessed grooves of
said holders are caused to coincide with the

second recessed grooves of said collars and said
projecting ridges of said shaft assemblies are

slid, thereby mounting and removing said supply
and take-up rolls.
An apparatus according to claim 6, characterized
in that each of said shaft assemblies has a hollow

core member on which said web is wound, a
central shaft inserted in said core member and

matters and transfer the scraped foreign
matters from a proximal end portion of said

cleaning unit to said web traveling from said
