<ABSTRACT>
The production of an injection moulding of plastics material comprises introducing a supply of plastics material through one or more openings in a mould space, and introducing by means of at least one gas supply passage a pressurised gas through a separate opening (44) in the mould space (13) into the plastics material filling the mould space whereby the gas creates a gas containing cavity (25) in the plastics material. Opening and closing of the gas supply passage (56) is controlled by a valve which is opened by the pressurised gas. The valve comprises a valve port (50) at the outlet end of the gas passage, and a movable valve member (31) extending longitudinally of the gas passage (56) for opening and closing the valve port (50). The valve member (31) at least when in its extended or valve port open position protrudes into the mould space and penetrates the plastics material thereby assisting the gas to enter the plastics material. Also with the valve member (31) in its withdrawn or valve port closed position plastics material is shut off from entering the end of the passage (56) from the mould space.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for producing an injection moulding of plastics 
material according to the precharacterising parts of claims 1 and 5 
respectively. European Patent Specification No. 0283207 
describes and claims an apparatus for producing an 
injection moulding of plastics material comprising 
means for introducing plastics material into a mould 
space through one or more openings. Means are also 
provided for introducing through a separate opening in 
the mould space a pressurised gas into the plastics 
material filling the mould space, whereby the gas 
creates a gas containing cavity in the plastics 
material, and for thereafter relieving the gas 
pressure within the gas containing cavity before the 
mould is opened. The gas supply/pressure relieving 
means comprises at the separate opening a valve port 
opening directly into the mould space, a valve member 
for opening and closing the valve port, and means to 
supply pressurised gas to the mould space. In 
operation, the gas supply means is arranged to supply 
gas through the valve member whilst the valve member 
is in a valve port closed position, to create the 
cavity. After the moulding operation has finished, 
the supply of pressurised gas is terminated and 
pressurised gas in the cavity in the moulding is 
vented to the atmosphere by movement of the valve 
member to a valve port open position. The mould is 
then opened. In a preferred embodiment the pressurised gas 
enters the plastics material through a first 
passageway in the valve member. Venting of the 
pressurised gas from the cavity is performed through a 
second passageway to the atmosphere, the cavity being 
connected to the second passageway by withdrawing the  
 
valve member from the valve port closed position to 
the valve port open position. The first and second 
passageways converge at the opening through which the 
gas enters the mould space. The valve member is 
connected to the piston of a piston and cylinder for 
moving the valve member between its closed and open 
positions, and is positioned in the second passageway 
so that when the valve member is withdrawn the 
pressurised gas passes around the valve member into 
the second passageway and thereby to the atmosphere. 
The outlet end of the first passageway in the valve 
member is defined by a screw on cap containing a non-return 
valve comprising a captive ball. However, 
downstream of the ball, there is a short length of the 
first passageway into which plastics material can 
enter and

A method of producing an injection moulding of 
plastics material comprising introducing a supply of 

plastics material (19) through one or more openings 
(43) in a mould space (13), introducing by means of at 

least one gas supply passage (28, 56) a pressurised 
gas through a separate opening (44) in the mould space 

into the plastics material filling the mould space 
whereby the gas creates a gas containing cavity (25) 

in the plastics material, opening and closing of the 
gas supply passage being controlled by a valve which 

is opened by the pressurised gas, and thereafter 
relieving the gas pressure in the cavity through a 

second valve controlled passage (51) opening into the 
mould space, before opening the mould (9),
 
characterised in that the valve comprises a valve port 

(50) at the outlet end of the gas passage (56), and 
the method includes employing a valve member (31) 

extending longitudinally of the gas passage (56) and 
movable between extended and withdrawn positions for 

opening and closing the valve port (50) respectively, 
which valve member (31) at least when in its extended 

or valve port open position protrudes into the mould 
space (13) and penetrates the plastics material 

thereby assisting the gas to enter the plastics 
material to create the gas containing cavity (25) 

therein, withdrawing the valve member (31) into its 
valve port closed position prior to relieving the gas 

pressure in the cavity (25), whereby with the valve 
member (31) in its withdrawn or valve port closed 

position plastics material is shut off from entering 
the end of the passage (56) from the mould space (13), 

and subsequently relieving the gas pressure in the gas 
containing cavity (25) through the second valve 

controlled passage opening whilst maintaining the  
 

valve member (31) in its valve port closed position. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the pressure of the gas moves the valve member 

(31) into its extended or valve port open position and 
also maintains the valve member in its extended 

position. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the valve member (31) protrudes 

into the mould space (13) also when in its withdrawn 
or valve port closed position.

claims, characterised in that the valve member (31) is 

spring urged into its valve port closed position. 
Apparatus for producing an injection moulding of 
plastics material comprising means for introducing a 

supply of plastics material (19) through one or more

supply passage (28, 56) for introducing a pressurised 
gas through a separate opening (44) in the mould space 

(13) into the plastics material filling the mould 
space (13), whereby the gas creates a gas containing 

cavity (25) in the plastics material, the gas pressure 
within the cavity thereafter being relieved through a 

second valve controlled passage (51) opening into the

a control valve for opening and closing the gas supply 
passage (56), the valve being opened by the 

pressurised gas, characterised in that the valve 
comprises a valve port (50) at the outlet end of the 

gas passage and a valve member (31) extending 

longitudinally of the gas passage (56) which is 
movable between extended and withdrawn positions for  

 
opening and closing the valve port (50) respectively, 

which valve member (31) at least when in its extended 
or valve port open position protrudes into the mould 

space (13) and penetrates the plastics material 
thereby assisting the gas to flow into the plastics 

material to create the gas containing cavity (25) 
therein, and means (60) for withdrawing the valve 

member (31) into its valve port closed position prior 
to relieving the gas pressure in the cavity (25),
