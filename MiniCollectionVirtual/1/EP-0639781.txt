<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to waveguides and mode
coupling therein and more particularly to fiber optic
mode coupling.various techniques have been proposed for active mode
coupling in and intensity modulation of optical fibers.
US patent 5135295 describes fiber optic piezoelectric
devices comprising optical fibers coated with thin
piezoelectric and ferroelectric films. US Patent 5022732
describes a fiber optic intermode coupling single
sideband frequency shifter in which a travelling acoustic
wave is employed for mode coupling.Research disclosure No. 25839 entitled acoustic-optic
fiber modulations, published on October 1985
describes the use of an acoustic wave to modulate the
refractive index of the core of an optical fiber.DE 3543510 describes a method and apparatus for
stabilising the emission frequency of a laser by
generating a backward wave in an optical fiber connected
to the laser by stimulating a standing wave in an
aluminium block clamping a section of the optical fiber.
The standing wave is generated by means of opposing
piezoelectric elements on the clamping block.EP 0192887 describes a fiber optic phase modulator
which uses two opposing oscillators which clamp an
optical fiber and generate separate in phase
perpendicular forces to the fiber.The present invention seeks to provide improved
apparatus and a technique for active mode coupling in and
intensity modulation of a waveguide.The invention provides apparatus for mode coupling
in a waveguide comprising at least one wave guide, an
engagement substrate arranged for intimate contact with
at least one waveguide and at least two actuators coupled
to the engagement substrate and arranged to create an 
mechanical wave interference pattern in the engagement substrate for
producing a periodic deformation therein characterised in
that said at least one waveguide comprises a plurality of
waveguides and the apparatus is operative to couple
energy from at least one of said plurality of waveguides
to at least another of said plurality of waveguides.The invention also provides a method for mode
coupling in a waveguide including the steps of arranging
an engagement substrate in intimate contact with at least
one waveguide and creating a mechanical wave interference pattern in the
engagement substrate
for
producing a periodic deformation therein and
characterised in that said at least one waveguide
comprises a plurality of waveguides and said creating
step is operative to couple energy from at least one of
said plurality of waveguides to at least
