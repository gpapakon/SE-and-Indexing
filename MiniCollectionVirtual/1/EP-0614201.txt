<ABSTRACT>
A transformer arrangement is provided which has a primary and at least 
one secondary winding (12; 13, 14) coupled via a movable armature (18) 

which is outside of the windings. A second transformer can be provided 
which has primary and secondary windings (15; 16, 17) coaxial with and 

surrounding the corresponding windings of the first transformer. The 
armature (18) is tubular and slidable in the radial clearance defined 

between the windings (12, 13, 14) of the first transformer and the 
windings (15, 16, 17) of the second transformer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a transformer arrangement. It is known to mount linear differential transformers within piston and 
cylinder units, for example within jacks in hydraulic servo systems, to 
provide position signals. To facilitate making the wiring connections it is 
common practice to arrange that the transformer windings are mounted 
on a stationary part of the piston and cylinder unit, and the armature 
mounted on the movable part. It is known for the armature to take the 
form of a rod which is moved as an internal core within windings of the 
usual annular form. This requires that the armature be supported on a 
long slender non-magnetic support. It is common practice in aircraft hydraulic servo systems to provide 
duplicate control loops, and this may require duplicated linear 
differential transformers. If separate transformers are mounted side by 
side the problem arises that the armatures must be mounted in exact 
alignment with their respective windings. It is therefore necessary either 
to prevent relative rotation between the piston and cylinder of the unit in 
which the transformers are mounted, or to mount the armatures in 
bearings on the movable element and to provide guides which maintain 
the armatures in alignment with their windings. This results in a 
cumbersome and complex assembly. Alternatively the transformers may be axially aligned in tandem with 
each other. It is, however, frequently difficult or impossible to 
accommodate the tandem windings in the length available in the 
stationary element of the piston and cylinder unit. Additionally the  
 
armature must necessarily be supported on a relatively long stem which 
may flex and give inaccurate readings from the transducer arrangement. GB 2 132 362 discloses a transformer arrangement comprising two linear 
differential transformers. Each of the transformers includes a primary 
winding and at least one secondary winding, the windings being 
coaxially arranged. The transformers have cores which are disposed 
inside the windings and connected together by a movable member 
whose position is thus sensed. The transformers are thus axially aligned 
in tandem with each other. According to the invention there is provided a transformer arrangement 
comprising two linear differential transformers, each of which includes a 
primary winding and at least one secondary winding, said windings 
being co-axially arranged, one of said primary windings being 
surrounded, with radial clearance, by the other of said primary windings,
