<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photographic 
composition having fixing capacity and a method for 
processing a silver halide photographic material using the 
same; more particularly to a method for processing a 
silver halide photographic material wherein even when 
low-replenishing-rate processing is carried out, the 
fixing is not delayed. The processing of silver halide color 
photographic materials generally comprises a color-developing 
process and a desilvering process. The silver 
produced in the development is oxidized with a bleaching 
agent and then is dissolved by the action of a fixing 
agent. As the bleaching agent, a ferric (III) ion complex 
salt (e.g., an aminopolycarboxylic acid/ferric (III) 
complex salt) is used mainly, and as the fixing agent a 
thiosulfate is generally used. On the other hand, the processing of black-and-white 
photographic materials comprises a developing 
process and a process for removing the unexposed silver  
 
halide, and it differs from the processing of color 
photographic materials in that the black-and-white 
photographic material is subjected to the fixing process 
without being subjected to a bleaching process after the 
development. Also in this case, as the fixing agent, 
generally a thiosulfate is used. In recent years, reduction of the replenisher 
volume of photographic processing solutions has been 
vigorously studied. This is also true for the bath having 
fixing capacity. As low-replenishing-rate processing 
proceeds, the amounts of silver ions and halide ions 
(e.g., iodide ions, bromide ions, and chloride ions) that 
accumulate in the running exhausted solution increase, 
resulting in slowing of fixing, which is a serious 
problem, and therefore a solution composition is desired 
with which, even when low-replenishing-rate processing is 
effected, the fixing is not delayed. Further, the stability of solutions becomes 
problem because of the elongation of retention time at the 
low-replenishment-rate processing. In particular, 
thiosulfates that are used widely as fixing agents have a 
problem of sulfur-deposit, improvement of which problem is 
highly desired. To improve the above-described problem, 
conventionally thiocyanate ions (e.g., ammonium  
 
thiocyanate and sodium thiocyanate) are added into a 
fixing solution, but the delay in the fixing is not 
satisfactorily improved and there is concern about the 
influence of thiocyanate ions on the environment, and 
therefore more effective materials are desired. Therefore, the first object
