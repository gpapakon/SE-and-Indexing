<ABSTRACT>
A load-handling parallel arm clamp structure (10) for 
a lift truck comprises a slide guide frame (14) having 

respective upper and lower pairs of elongate, parallel, 
vertically-spaced transverse slide guides (20, 22) with 

load-arm supporting slide members (26, 28) longitudinally 
movable thereon alternatively toward or away from one 

another in a mutually overlapping longitudinal 
relationship. Each slide member (26, 28) at least 

partially surrounds the respective slide guide (20, 22) 
upon which it is mounted, and each slide guide in turn at 

least partially surrounds a respective piston and cylinder 
assembly (44, 46) for moving the slides relative to the 

guides. The upper and lower pairs of guides (20, 22) are 
separated by a wide, unobstructed central vertical space 

through which the operator can view in a forward direction, 
such space being unoccupied by any view-impeding piston and 

cylinder assemblies due to their placement inside the 
guides. A compact fluid manifold (54) and valve 

arrangement (56) for controlling the piston and cylinder 
assemblies, together with the space-saving cylinder-enclosing 

slide guides (20, 22), minimize the thickness of 
the entire assembly in the forward direction to maximize 

load-carrying capacity compatibly with the high degree of 
operator visibility provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in lift
truck load-handling attachments having parallel load-handling
arms (i.e. clamp arms, laterally-movable forks
or other load-engaging implements), mounted on transverse
slide members for opening and closing and thereby forcibly
engaging the sides of loads. Such load-handling arms
typically exert relatively high inward lateral force on a
load by closing forcibly against the opposite exterior
sides thereof to engage and lift it. In some cases the
arms may also exert lateral force in an outward direction
by opening forcibly against interior opposed surfaces of
a load.Prior load-handling devices of this type,
referred to hereafter generally as load "clamps," are
exemplified by U.S. patents 2,746,630, 2,782,065,
4,185,944 and 4,279,564, and by clamps manufactured by
Kaup & Co. GmbH of Germany. All such load clamps have
had certain characteristics in common to enable them to
function properly. First, the slide members, and the
slide guides upon which the slide members are movably
mounted, have always been capable of withstanding large
load moments, particularly moments about vertical axes in
reaction to the lateral clamping force and, in some
cases, moments about longitudinal axes where the load
arms are forks and the lateral clamping force is concentrated
adjacent the lower extremity of the slide
assembly. These large load moments have required an
extremely strong and rigid guide and slide assembly, most
commonly provided by respective upper and lower pairs of
guides and slides. Moreover, because the range of load
widths is extremely large, a correspondingly large range
of extensibility and retractability of the slide members
has been required to enable the load arms to accommodate 
the different load widths. This in turn has required
that the elongate slide members, the slide guides upon
which they are mounted, and the piston and cylinder
assemblies which move the slide members, all be of significant
length, with the slide members longitudinally
movable alternatively toward or away from one another
in a mutually-overlapping longitudinal relationship.
Furthermore, the forward protrusion of the slide members
must be minimized so that the load can be carried by a
counterbalanced lift truck at the smallest possible
forward distance from the truck's front axle, in order
to maximize the load-carrying capacity of the counter-balanced
truck.Several of the foregoing requirements of load
clamps differ significantly from those of fork-positioning
devices which also mount on
