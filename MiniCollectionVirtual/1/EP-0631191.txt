<ABSTRACT>
An electrophotographic method for liquid toner 
development using an organic, positive-charging photoconductor 

((+)OPC) is disclosed. The (+) OPC has a 
conductive substrate, and a polymeric binder with polar and 

non-polar functional moieties, the binder being a layer on 
the substrate greater than or equal to about 1 micron thick. 

Also, the (+) OPC has a phthalocyanine pigment component, 
and an arylamine sensitizer component selected from the 

group of: N-Ar(Ri)n, i = 1,2,3   (I) n = 
0,5 where Ar = phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl or ter-phenyl 

groups, and R = alkyl and alkoxy groups, and


-(0-C-phenyl-N-phenyl)n ,   (II)



 
n = 1 - 10, both the phthalocyanine component and the 

arylamine sensitizer component being uniformly distributed 
throughout the binder component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to photoconductor
electrophotography. More specifically, the invention relates to a single-layer, positive-charging, organic
photoconductor material with low pigment loading for liquid toner
electrophotography.In electrophotography, a latent image is created on the surface of
an insulating, photoconducting material by selectively exposing areas of the
surface to light. A difference in electrostatic charge density is created between
the areas on the surface exposed and unexposed to light. The latent
electrostatic image is developed into a visible image by electrostatic toners
containing pigment components and thermoplastic components. The toners are
selectively attracted to the photoconductor surface either exposed or unexposed
to light, depending on the relative electrostatic charges of the photoconductor
surface, development electrode and the toner. The photoconductor may be
either positively or negatively charged, and the toner system similarly may
contain negatively or positively charged particles. For laser printers, the
preferred embodiment is that the photo-conductor and toner have the same
polarity, but different levels of charge.A sheet of paper or intermediate transfer medium is given an
electrostatic charge opposite that of the toner and passed close to the
photoconductor surface, pulling the toner from the photoconductor surface onto
the paper or intermediate medium still in the pattern of the image developed
from the photoconductor surface. A set of fuser rollers melts and fixes the
toner in the paper, subsequent to direct transfer, or indirect transfer when using
an intermediate transfer medium, producing the printed image. There is a demand in the laser printer industry for multi-colored
images. Responding to this demand, designers have turned to liquid toners,
with pigment components and thermoplastic components dispersed in a liquid
carrier medium, usually special hydrocarbon liquids. With liquid toners, it has
been discovered, the basic printing colors - yellow, magenta, cyan and black,
may be applied sequentially to a photoconductor surface, and from there to a
sheet of paper or intermediate medium to produce a multi-colored image.The important photoconductor surface, therefore, has been the
subject of much research and development in the electrophotography art. A
large number of photoconductor materials have been disclosed as being suitable
for the electrophotographic photoconductor surface. For example, inorganic
compounds such as amorphous silicon
