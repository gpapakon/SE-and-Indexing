<ABSTRACT>
A photographic material contains, on one side of an opaque base provided with a polyolefin coating on both sides, at least one silver halide emulsion layer and, on the other side, an antistatic layer whose binder contains an oil former (30-95% by weight) containing carboxyl groups and a polymer latex (5-70% by weight). The antistatic layer is distinguished by a high abrasion resistance and is suitable for processing in machines fitted with textile rolls.

<CLAIMS>
Photosensitive photographic material which contains on 
one side of an opaque film support, provided on both 

sides with a polyolefin coating, one or more silver 
halide emulsion layers and, on the other side, an 

antistatic layer, characterised in that the antistatic 
layer is formulated without silicate and contains 1.5 

to 9 parts by weight of a binder for 1 part by weight 
of the antistatic agent, which binder consists of 30 

to 95 wt.% of an oil-former containing carboxyl groups 
and 70 to 5 wt.% of polymer latex (solids). 
Photographic material according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the oil-former, containing 

carboxyl groups is a succinic acid semi-ester 
according to one of the formulae I and II 


 
in which 


R¹
means alkyl or alkenyl with 8 to 18 C atoms; 
R²
means alkyl with 2 to 12 C atoms, linear or 
branched and optionally interrupted by one or 

more O atoms (polyether alkyl), an unsubstituted 
or substituted cylcoalkyl or aryl group, a 

condensed arylcycloalkyl residue, an aralkyl 
group or the group  

 

X
means cyclohexylene, 

 
cycloalkylene-alkylene-cycloalkylene or one of 

the groups -CH₂-CH₂-(O-CH₂-CH₂)₃₋₇ and 

Photographic material according to one of claims 1 and 
2, characterized in that the polymer latex is a homo- 

or copolymer of one or more ethylenically unsaturated 
polymerisable compounds or a polyurethane. 
Photographic material according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the copolymer contains 2 to 

5 wt.% of polymerised acrylic acid. 
Photographic material according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the copolymer contains 40 to 

93 wt.% of polymerised styrene and 5 to 58 wt.% of 
polymerised butadiene. 
Photographic material according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the polymer latex entirely or 

partially consists of polytetrafluoroethylene . 
Photographic material according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the polymer latex comprises 1 to 

4 parts by weight of an optionally carboxylated  
 

butadiene/styrene copolymer for 1 part by weight of 
polytetrafluoroethylene. 
Photographic material according to one of claims 1 
to 7, characterised by containing an amphoteric 

antistatic agent, which may be obtained by reacting a 
cationic antistatic agent with an anionic wetting 

agent.
