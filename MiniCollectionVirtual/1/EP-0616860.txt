A punch including a plate positioning and feeding system, comprising 
a positioning station (72) disposed upstream of the punch (10) and including positioning 

means for positioning a plate (18; 36; 60) with respect to a pair of orthogonal 
axes, and at least one feed device (22; 38) actuated by drive means controlled by 

a numerical control, the feed device including gripping means (24, 26) gripping the 
plate (18; 36; 60) and advancing it to the punch in a cycled manner corresponding to 

cycling of the punch, characterized by at least two sensors (80, 82; 84, 86) spaced to 
each other along a transverse axis perpendicular to the feeding direction (16) of the 

feed device and arranged to sense leading and trailing edges of a plate (36) so as to 
provide signals to be used in the numerical control for determining any deviations of 

said edges of said plate (36) from said transverse axis and to correct the feeding of 
the plate by the drive means of the feed device such that there will be no punching 

through the plate edges. 
A punch including a plate positioning and feeding system, comprising 
a positioning station (72) disposed upstream of the punch (10) and including positioning 

means for positioning a plate (18; 36; 60) with respect to a pair of orthogonal 
axes, and at least one feed device (22; 38) actuated by drive means controlled 

by a numerical control, the feed device including gripping means (24, 26) gripping 
the plate (18; 36; 60) and advancing it to the punch in a cycled manner corresponding 

to cycling of the punch, characterized by at least two sensors (80, 82, 84, 86) 
disposed between said positioning station (72) and the punch (10) and spaced from 

each other transversely to said feed device, said sensors being arranged to sense 
leading and trailing edges of a plate (36) so as to provide corresponding signals, said 

numerical control being arranged to derive an actual value of the plate length from 
said sensor signals and feed data of the feed device from the numerical control and 

to compare said actual value with a desired value stored in the numerical control and 
to compute a correction value from any difference between said desired and actual 

values, said correction value being used to correct the further feed of the respective  
 

plate by said drive means (34, 44) such that there will be no punching through the 
plate edges. 
A punch as defined in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said numerical 
control is arranged to provide a stop signal when any difference between said 

desired and actual values or any deviation of said plate edges from said transverse 
axis exceeds a respective predetermined value. 
A punch as defined in any of claims 2 or 3, characterized in that said 
sensors (80, 82, 84, 86) comprise laser light sensors. 
A punch as defined in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized by the 
following features: 


a) the punch (10) includes a pair of rows of punching tools (12, 
14), with the rows being spaced along the direction of feed (16) of the plates (18, 

36, 60); 
b) a first feed device (22) includes first gripping means (24, 26) 
adapted to be displaced at least along the feed direction by first numerically controled 
drive means (34) between leading and trailing positions and arranged to grip a 

plate (36) in said positioning station (72) when in its trailing position and to advance 
the plate towards the punch (10) to a change-over position which is downstream of 

said positioning station (72); 
c) a second feed device (38) includes second gripping means (50, 
52) adapted to be displaced at least along the feed direction by second numerically 

controlled drive means (44) between leading and trailing positions and arranged to 
grip a plate when it is in said change-over position; 
d) the change-over position is arranged to correspond to the positioning 
of the plates (18, 36) during a punching stroke of the punch (10) when the 

punch (10) has already performed at least one preceding punching stroke on a plate; 
e) said first and second feed devices (22, 38) cooperate so that the 
punching tools (12) in the leading row perform the last punching stroke with respect 

to a first plate (18) at the same time when the punching tools in the trailing row (14) 
perform the first punching stroke with respect to the following plate (36). 
A punch as defined in claim 5, characterized in that said second griping 
means (50, 52) are arranged to laterally grip each plate (18) from opposite sides 

at the trailing end thereof when the plate (18) is in said change-over position. 
A punch as defined in claim 5, characterized in that a loading station 
(70) is provided upstream of said positioning station (72) and a third feed device is 

provided to advance the plates (60) into said positioning station (72). 
A punch as defined in claim 7, characterized in that said third feed 
device includes a pair of parallel conveyor bands (62, 64) driven by separate numerically 

controlled third drive means and each including a drive member (66, 68), with 
the drive members (66, 68) being arranged so that one of said drive members is disposed 

upstream of a plate (60) and the other is disposed downstream of said plate 
(60). 
A punch as defined in claim 8, characterized in that the conveyor band 
(62) of the leading one (68) of said drive members (66, 68) is controlled so that it 

engages the leading edge of a plate (60) when said plate (60) is advanced towards 
said positioning station (72).
