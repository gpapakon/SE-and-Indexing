<ABSTRACT>
In a method for mounting prefabricated deck sections 
(5a, 5b, 5c) of a suspension bridge, deck sections 

are lifted consecutively to their respective final 
elevated position in which position hangers (3) depending 

from the suspension cables (2) are secured to 
the just lifted deck section and the latter is at 

least provisionally connected to the adjacent deck 
section previously mounted. The method comprises the 

following steps: 

a lifting device platform (4) is secured to the 
hangers (3a, 3b) relating to the deck section 

(5a) to be lifted; 
the deck section (5a) to be lifted is elevated by 
means of lifting devices mounted on the lifting 

device platform (4); 
the hangers (3a, 3b) are secured to the deck section 
(5a) after it has been lifted into its entirely 

elevated position; 
the lifting device platform (4) is detached from 
the hangers (3a, 3b) of the deck section just 

mounted; 
the lifting device platform (4) is advanced to a 
position above the deck section to be lifted next 

adjacent to the deck section just mounted; 
the lifting device platform (4) is secured to the 
hangers relating to the deck section to be lifted 

next.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
mounting prefabricated deck sections of a 
suspension bridge wherein deck sections 
positioned below the suspension cables of the 
suspension bridge essentially at surface level 
(ground or sea level) are lifted consecutively 
to their respective final elevated position in 
which position hangers depending from the 
suspension cables are secured to the lifted 
deck section and the latter is at least 
provisionally connected to the adjacent deck 
section previously mounted. Methods of this type are generally known. FR-A-2580687 
discloses such a method in which the 
deck sections are lifted by cranes travelling 
on the suspension cables of the suspension 
bridge. Furthermore it is known to lift the 
deck sections by means of winches winding on 
lifting wires deflected at trolleys travelling 
on the suspension cables; the winches are 
located on the ground (WO 91/08344, Fig. 1). 
Furthermore the deck sections may be lifted by 
means of a floating crane (WO 91/08344, Fig. 
2). WO 91/08344 finally discloses a method for 
lifting a deck section wherein lifting device  
 
yokes are secured to the deck sections while 
corresponding lifting wire yokes are secured 
to the hangers depending from the suspension 
cables; each lifting device yoke comprises two 
lifting devices, and lifting wires are secured 
to the lifting wire yokes (Fig. 16). The 
disclosure is silent about the question how to 
secure the lifting wire yokes to the hangers; 
apparently they are mounted at the hangers 
before the latter are secured to the 
suspension cables. The above mentioned method employing a 
floating crane is very expensive where very 
heavy prefabricated deck sections shall be 
mounted due to the enormous costs for a suited 
floating crane. The method employing winches 
located on the ground is costly due to the 
requirement for very long lifting wires. The 
method using lifting cranes requires 
corresponding long wires to secure the cranes 
in their position. The last mentioned method 
employing lifting cable yokes at the hangers 
and lifting device yokes at the deck sections 
is very costly as well since a proper lifting 
wire yoke is required for each hanger; a 
further shortcoming is that the freely 
dangling lifting wires not in use may damage 
each other. A shortcoming common to all prior  
 
art methods is that they are very time 
consuming; this is since the deck sections 
must be lifted very slowly otherwise the 
lifted deck section could clash with the 
adjacent one. It
