<ABSTRACT>
An audio signal recording apparatus is constructed to 
record a track number signal which allows a sure 

detection of a head position of a music piece. An audio 
signal (Sa) to be recorded is delayed for the recording 

by a first predetermined time period (T₁). A start 
time of each music piece is detected by a transition from 

a silent state to a sound bearing state of the audio 
signal, and a track number signal (S
d
) is incremented 
at a timing a second predetermined time period (T₂), 

which is shorter than the first predetermined time 
period, after a detection of the start time of a music 

piece, and the track number signal having been 
incremented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
apparatus for recording an audio signal.In the recording of music software on a recording
medium such as a CD (Compact Disc), an MD (Mini Disc),
and a DAT (Digital Audio Tape), it is general to record
subcode information representing data relating to the
recorded music piece such as the music piece number in
addition to the audio signal corresponding to each music
piece. In a playing apparatus, such as a CD player, for
playing back the recorded music software, the subcode
information is retrieved, in addition to the audio
signal, from the recording medium so that a fast access
to the head part of a desired music piece is enabled by
using such subcode information. Therefore, it is desired
that the information representing the music piece number
is recorded together with the audio signal also in a
recording apparatus for the dubbing of music pieces from
music software recorded on the above-described recording
medium.EP-A-0 480 682 discloses a recording apparatus that detects
a silent period in an audio signal and increases
the track number by one after such a detection.However, with a conventional arrangement for the 
recording of the audio signal and the track number
information, there has been a problem that the recorded
track number cannot be used for the fast access to the
desired music piece because of the time difference
between the recorded audio signal and the track number
information.An object of the present invention is therefore to
the drawback of the conventional apparatus, and to
provide an audio signal recording apparatus which
performs the generation and recording of a track number
signal by which a sure detection of a head part of a
music piece is enabled.According to the present invention, an audio signal
recording apparatus for recording an audio signal
corresponding to at least one music piece on a recording
medium, comprises a delay circuit for delaying the audio
signal by a first predetermined time period, and
producing a delayed audio signal, a voice detection
circuit for detecting a start time of a music piece based
on a transition from a silent state to a sound bearing
state of the audio signal at the input of the delay means, and producing a detection
signal, a storage device for storing a track number
signal representing the number of a music piece, a
circuit for incrementing the track number signal stored 
in the storage device by one when a second
predetermined time period shorter than the first
predetermined time period has elapsed
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A recording apparatus (2) for recording an audio

signal (Sa) corresponding to at least one music piece on a
recording medium (25a), comprising:


delay means (21) for delaying said audio signal by a
first predetermined time period (T1), and producing a delayed

audio signal (Sc);
voice detection means (22) for detecting a start time of
a music piece based on a transition from a silent state

to a sound bearing state of said audio signal at the input of said delay means (21), and
producing a detection signal (Sb);
storage means (29) for storing a track number signal
representing the number of a music piece;
means (29) for incrementing said track number signal
stored in said storage means (29) by one when a second

predetermined time period (T2) shorter than said first
predetermined time period (T1) has elapsed after a generation

of said detection signal (Sb); and
recording means (25c) for recording a recording signal
produced by respectively modulating said delayed audio

signal and said track number signal, on said recording
medium.
