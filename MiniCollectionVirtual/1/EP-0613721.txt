<ABSTRACT>
The new invention proposes guiding recycling products in the form of e.g. small pieces (13) of material into a comminuting space (8) at the same time as hot gases (3). In this space, an impeller (1) is arranged, which comminutes the pieces (13) of material to a size of 2 - 3 mm and throws them into a swirling chamber (2), in which a multiple recirculation takes place. The adequately comminuted parts are conveyed with the drying gases (3) into a drying tower (15) and extracted via a cyclone. The drying tower is designed as a rising sifter (16) and has a return duct (18) for oversizes. The method and the device are in particular suitable for the processing of e.g. egg shells, glass recycling waste, and also a large number of organic recycling products such as the most varied agricultural products and other organic waste of animal origin. The end product can be separated into very different material categories or e.g. used as feed.
