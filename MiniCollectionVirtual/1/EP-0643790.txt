<ABSTRACT>
The lock has two door systems (2; 4) spaced apart and defining a lock chamber between them which are lockable in predetermined positions by means of conventional electronically controlled locking mechanisms. In addition, there is a direct coupling mechanism (7, 8) between the two door systems which initiates the opening or closing of one door system during the closing or opening process of the other.

<CLAIMS>
Access lock for authorized persons, having a first and a
second door system (2 resp. 4) each being equipped with at

least one door wing (2a, 2b; 4a, 4b), the door systems (2; 4)
being spaced apart and defining a lock chamber between them,

and further having electrically or electronically controlled
locking mechanisms for said two door systems (2; 4) which are

unlocked in a controlled manner if predetermined criteria are
fulfilled to enable actuation of said door systems (2; 4),

characterized in that the door wings (2a, 2b; 4a, 4b) of both
door systems (2; 4) are hinged to posts (1a, 1b) forming the

door frame or to an auxiliary frame (11) to be mounted between
the posts (1a, 1b) at a depth corresponding substantially to

the depth of the door frame, whereby the wings (2a, 2b; 4a, 4b)
of each door system (2; 4) can swing outwardly of the plane of

the frame, and in that a mechanical coupling mechanism (9, 10,
12) is provided between said two door systems (2; 4), which

mechanism upon actuation of one of said door systems (2 resp.
4) over predetermined swing ranges is positively actuating the

other door system (4 resp. 2), such that in case of satisfied
passage criteria already during closing of one of said door

systems (2 resp. 4) the opening of the other door system (4
resp. 2) is positively initiated, whereby the opening width

necessary for the passage of a person at said other door system
(4 resp. 2) and its final unlocking is reached respectively

takes place only once the opening width of said one door system 
(2 resp. 4) has diminished under provisional locking, in such a

manner, that the passage of a person is no longer possible.
Access lock as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
one of said door systems (2) is a master door system and the

other (4) is a slave door system.
Access lock as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that each door system (2; 4) comprises at least two door wings

(2a, 2b; 4a, 4b) connected for synchronous movement.
Access lock as defined in claim 3, characterized in that
one door system (4) comprises a double wing door, wherein each

wing (4a; 4b) is provided with an additional folding wing (4c;
4d) and in that mechanical means are provided for actuating the

folding wings (4c; 4d) also synchronously with the movement of
the main wings (4a; 4b).
Access lock as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that
the slave door system comprises additional folding wings (4c,

4d) and in that the lock room is dimensioned such that in consideration
of the swivelling range of the folding wings (2a, 

2b; 4a, 4c; 4b, 4d) only one single person at once can pass
through the lock.
Access lock according to any one of claims 1-5, characterized
in that said mechanical coupling mechanism (9, 10, 11)

comprises push- and pull-rods.
Access lock as claimed in claim 1 and 2, characterized by
a central drive wheel with connecting-rod for actuation of the

master door (2).
Access lock as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that
the slave door (4) is also coupled with said central drive

wheel by the intermediary of a toggle lever having a selectively
lockable intermediary hinge.
