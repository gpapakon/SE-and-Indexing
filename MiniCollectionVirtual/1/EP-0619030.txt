<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a surface, or electric field, stabilised ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) device with an improved contrast ratio between its two switched states. The device comprises a liquid crystal cell formed by a thin layer (7), typically 1 to 5  mu m thick, of a smectic liquid crystal material, e.g. a smectic c, held between two glass walls (2, 3) coated on their inner faces with electrodes (5, 6). Polarisers (8, 9) are arranged on either side of the walls (2, 3). The device is switched between two bistable states by application of unidirectional voltage pulses, with or without the simultaneous application of ac bias voltages. To obtain optimum contrast ratio CR, the optical axes of the polarisers are rotated away from a crossed, or orthogonal position, e.g. by +/-20 DEG , and the cell rotated between the polarisers (8, 9); the precise optimum rotation depends upon material, and ac bias voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FERROELECTRIC LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY DEVICEThis invention relates to ferroelectric liquid crystal display devices, specifically a device with improved contrast ratios.Liquid crystal display devices are well known. They typically comprise a liquid crystal cell formed by a thin layer of a liquid crystal material held between two glass walls. These walls carry transparent electrodes which apply an electric field across the liquid crystal layer to cause a rotation of the molecules of liquid crystal material. The liquid crystal molecules in many displays adopt one of two states of molecular arrangement, one of which may be a voltage OFF state and the other a voltage ON state. Information is displayed by areas of liquid crystal material in one state contrasting with areas in the other state. One known display is formed as a matrix of pixels or display elements produced at the intersections between column electrodes on one walls and row electrodes on the other wall. The display is addressed in a multiplex manner by applying voltages to successive row and column electrodes. Another type of display is a shutter which is addressed in a direct drive manner.Liquid crystal materials are of three basis types, nematic, cholesteric, and smectic each having a distinctive molecular arrangement. 
The present invention concerns ferro electric smectic liquid crystal materials. Devices using this material form the surface stabilised ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) device. These devices can show bistability, ie the liquid crystal molecules, more correctly the molecular director, adopt one of two alignment states on switching by positive and negative voltage pulses and remain in the switched state after removal of the voltage. This behaviour depends upon the surface alignment properties. Some types of surface alignment will produce a device in which the switched states remain after removal of the voltage, other types of surface alignment will produce a device in which the states may randomly decay on removal of the voltage. The switched states may be stabilised by the presence of an ac bias. The actual states achieved may be dependent upon the amplitude of any ac bias present. The ac bias may be provided by the data (column) voltates in a mulitplexed device. This property, together with the fast switching speed, makes FLC devices suitable for large displays with a large number of pixels or display elements. Such, ferroelectric displays are described for example in:- N A Clark and S T Lagerwall, Applied Physics Letters Vol
