<ABSTRACT>
An airbag cover (10) is provided with a membrane 
horn switch (18) which is more reliable than prior art 

switches. A portion of the cover is thinned to provide a 
flexible horn actuation area (14). The membrane switch is 

mounted against the inner surface of the horn actuation 
area and is backed by a rigid panel (20) mounted to the 

cover.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to motor vehicle airbags.
More particularly, it relates to a driver is side airbag
module cover of the kind defined in the preamble of claim 1,
said module cover
having an integral horn switch which is easily and reliably
actuated.
US-A-5 186 490 shows a module cover of the same kind.Typically a driver side airbag module is mounted
within a motor vehicle's steering wheel. This is the same
area which conventionally includes the horn switch.
Accordingly, the resilient thermoplastic airbag module
cover has also served to actuate a horn switch. One way in
which this has been accomplished has been to mount a
membrane type switch on the back or inner surface of the
airbag module cover. Membrane type switches conventionally
comprise two very thin sheets having conductive coatings
which are normally separated by thin spacers. Pressure on
the switch presses the conductive surfaces together to
close a circuit and actuate the horn. The thickness of
such a switch may be only, for example, approximately .25
mm thick.Obviously in order to actuate a membrane switch,
the force applied by the driver must be able to compress
the switch. In prior art installations, the membrane switch
could only be compressed against the folded airbag itself.
As a result, a fairly substantial degree of cover
depression was required. The result was less than optimum
reliability and slowed reaction in emergency situations. The present invention consists in a driver's side air bag
module cover having a front outer surface and a rear inner
surface which comprises:
a relatively flexible horn actuation area defined by a
region of said cover and depressible from its front surface by
a driver;a membrane type horn switch mounted behind said horn
actuation area on the rear surface of said cover; anda substantially rigid back panel mounted to the rear
surface of said cover and enclosing said horn switch
therebetween, characterized in that said horn actuation area
is a thinned area of the rear inner surface, the membrane horn
switch being mounted within and substantially filling said
thinned area and the rigid back panel overlapping the thinned
area.There can thus be provided an improved airbag cover and
horn switch assembly having increased reliability and
emergency actuation response.A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be
described with reference to the accompanying drawings
wherein:
FIG. 1 is the driver's view of an airbag cover in
accordance with this invention;FIG. 2 is an elevational view of a back panel
