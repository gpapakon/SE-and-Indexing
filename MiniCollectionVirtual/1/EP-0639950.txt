 DENTAL INSPECTION DEVICEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a dental inspection device, which is intended to allow an individual layman to conduct his own dental examination. It may also be used for veterinary examination or for general use in industry.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMost people have at one time or another experienced difficulties in conducting a proper dental examination of their own teeth, for example by looking in a mirror. There is thus a danger of people neglecting to check their teeth regularly, particularly if periodical check-ups are not carried out by a dentist. In this way, irreparable dental damage may occur, which might have been prevented had a simple device been available with which the individual could regularly monitor his own teeth and gums.US patent 4,993,945 discloses a heated dental mirror which is battery operated and includes an illumination device. International patents W080/00300 and 088/08686 also disclose illuminated mirrors.US patent 4,872,838 discloses a complex self inspection device which includes extenders for moving the cheek out of the way. However the construction is complicated, expensive to produce and difficult to use.It is an object of the present invention to provide a 

device of the aforementioned type which improves on those currently available.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThus, the present invention provides a dental inspection device which comprises:- a handle portion, a mouth portion, and a neck portio connecting the mouth portion to the handle portion;- a low voltage battery means located in the handle portion, which is electrically connected to illumination means for illuminating the object to be viewed;- mirror means located in the mouth portion for dental inspection; and- the neck portion being at least as wide as the handl portion such as to displace the cheek or tongue of the person during viewing and to give an unobstructe view of the mirror means.For ease of operation, the neck portion is preferabl offset relative to the handle portion. However, the mirror means and the mouth portion are preferably substantially parallel to the handle portion.In order to prevent condensation on the mirror means during use, the device may include a heater for heating the mirror means, and which is operated from the low voltage battery means. However, in a preferred embodimen the illumination means comprises an electric bulb and a 

metal reflector located behind the bulb. The mirror means is also formed of metal and is in heat-conductive

CLAIMS
1. A dental inspection device which comprises;
- a longitudinally extending handle portion, a mouth portion, and a neck portion connecting the mouth portion to the handle portion; a compartment for a low voltage battery means located in the handle portion, and means for electrically connecting the battery to illumination means for illuminating the mouth;
- mirror means located in the mouth portion for dental inspection;
- the neck portion being at least as wide as the handle portion such as to displace the cheek or tongue of the person during viewing and give an unobstructed view of the mirror means.
2. A device according to claim 1 wherein the neck portion is offset relative to the handle portion.
3. A device according to claim 2 wherein the mirror means and the mouth portion are substantially parallel to the handle portion.
4. A device according to any preceding claim wherein the illumination means comprises a bulb and a reflector, the reflector and the mirror means being formed of metal such 


that heat from the bulb is conducted to warm the mirror means and prevent condensation thereon.
5. A device according to claim 4 which further comprises a convex lens over the bulb and fitted to the periphery of the reflector to protect the bulb.
6. A device according to claim 1 wherein the handle portion includes an end cover for the battery compartment which allows insertion of the battery means, the end cover being rotatable and being provided with switch means for turning the illumination means on and off.
7. A device according to any preceding claim wherein the mirror means is a magnifying mirror.
8. A device according to any preceding claim wherein the illumination means is located in a cavity adjacent the mirror means for directing light onto the object being viewed.
9. A device according to claim 7 which further comprises a guard adjacent the illumination means for shielding thereof to substantially prevent light shining directly into the user's eyes. 


10. A device according to any preceding claim which is sealed against liquid entry.
11. A dental inspection device substantially as described in conjunction with the drawings.
