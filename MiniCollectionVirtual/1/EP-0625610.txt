<ABSTRACT>
A high internal bulk of a tissue web can be achieved during 
manufacturing of the basesheet by subjecting the tissue web 

to differential pressure while supported on a coarse fabric 
at a consistency of about 30 percent or greater. The 

differential pressure, such as by applying vacuum suction to 
the underside of the coarse fabric, causes the wet web to 

deflect into the openings or depressions in the fabric and 
"pop" back, resulting in a substantial gain in thickness or 

internal bulk. The method is especially adapted to improve 
the internal bulk of wet-pressed tissue webs.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the manufacture of tissue products, it is generally 
desireable to provide the final product with as much bulk as 
possible without compromising other product attributes. 
However, most tissue machines operating today utilize a 
process known as "wet-pressing", in which a large amount of 
water is removed from the newly-formed web by mechanically 
pressing water out of the web in a pressure nip between a 
pressure roll and the Yankee dryer surface as the web is 
transferred from a papermaking felt to the Yankee dryer. 
This wet-pressing step, while an effective dewatering means, 
compresses the web and causes a marked reduction in the web 
thickness and hence bulk. On the other hand, throughdrying processes have been more 
recently developed in which web compression is avoided as 
much as possible in order to preserve and enhance the bulk of 
the web. These processes provide for supporting the web on a 
coarse mesh fabric while heated air is passed through the web 
to remove moisture and dry the web. If a Yankee dryer is 
used at all in the process, it is for creping the web rather 
than drying, since the web is already dry when it is 
transferred to the Yankee surface. Transfer to the Yankee, 
although requiring compression of the web, does not 
significantly adversely affect web bulk because the 
papermaking bonds of the web have already been formed and the 
web is much more resilient in the dry state.  
 WO-A-93/00475 discloses a tissue product having at least three regions with different 
properties such as basis weight or density and as well as a method of making the 
same. According to WO-A-93/00475, the tissue product may be manufactured by 
depositing a fibrous slurry onto a forming belt having upstanding protuberances to form 
an embryonic fibrous structure having two regions of different basis weight. The fibrous 
structure is then transferred to a secondary belt having projections which do not 
coincide with the projections of the forming belt and subjected to differential fluid 
pressure applied by a vacuum box to deflect the fibers in the embryonic fibrous 
structure into conformance with the secondary belt, thereby dedensifying selected 
areas of the embryonic fibrous structure. The fibrous structure is then dried by any 
convenient drying means. According to WO-A-93/00475, the differential pressure is to 
be applied before too much of the liquid is carried away, preferably at a consistency of 
about 2% to about 35%. Although throughdried tissue products exhibit good bulk and 
softness
