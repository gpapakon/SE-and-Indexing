chamber, and comprising at least one burner (6), wherein the or 
each burner is a high-speed burner adapted for combustion in 

two combustion stages, with the second combustion stage taking 
place in the combustion chamber, the or each high-speed burner 

is arranged in such a manner that a flame formed by the or 
each high-speed burner is directed at the radiation plate, and

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas-fired infrared radiator as
set forth in the preamble of claim 1.Such an infrared radiator is disclosed in FR-A-2 680 225,
for the purpose of space heating.A disadvantage of the prior art device is that its
capacity is very limited, which is partly a consequence of the
type of burner which is used in this known infrared radiator.
The prior art publication involves a normal burner with a
relatively low flame intensity. As a consequence, the
temperature of the radiation plate is in the range of 380°C to
450°C. As a result of this relatively low temperature, the
radiation capacity at room temperature will be about 10 kW per
square meter of radiation plate. When used in an environment
with higher temperatures, which is typically the case in
industrial drying and heating processes, an infrared radiator
with such a low radiation plate temperature cannot be used.
Another drawback of the prior art gas-fired infrared radiator
is that no measures have been taken to lower the NOx content.
In addition, the prior art gas-fired radiator has relatively
large dimensions and the temperature distribution over the
plate is not uniform.Therefore, in a number of industrial drying and heating
processes, heretofore use has been made of convection heat.
The use of infrared radiation for these purposes would entail
a saving of energy but, as set out hereinabove, the use
thereof has been limited to date for lack of efficient gas-fired
infrared radiators.On the other hand, electrical radiators are employed for
various uses, such as the drying of printing inks in the
graphic industry and the drying of foods. This otherwise clean
form of heat generation, however, has a moderate energetic
efficiency. This is caused, on the one hand, by the low
generation efficiency of about 42% in the production of
electricity, and, on the other, by the radiation efficiency
which varies between 50% with radiation panels and 80% with 
quartz tube radiators. Calculated on the primary energy, the
radiation efficiency is therefore 20-30%. If the convective
heat of these radiation sources is utilized as well, the
overall efficiency may rise to 40%.In gas-fired radiators of open design, the radiation
efficiency, calculated on primary energy, is higher, viz.
40-50% and if the residual heat of the open radiator can also
be used in the process in question, the overall heat
utilization may run up to 80-90%.In a number of processes, however, open gas-fired
radiators have a number of disadvantages. Most important among
them are
