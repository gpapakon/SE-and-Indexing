      <u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <heading>1. Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention generally relates to a
mobile communication system, and more particularly, to a
mobile communication system that is capable of switching
the duplex modes of an uplink or downlink depending on the
transmission volume communicated between a base station
and a mobile station.</p>
    <heading>2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">Duplexing carried out in the current mobile
communication system is generally classified into
frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex
(TDD).</p>
    <p num="0003">Fig. 1 illustrates a conventional cell structure
in FDD communication, and Fig. 2 illustrates the basic
concept of conventional FDD communication. As shown in Fig.
1, base stations 11<sub>1</sub>, 11<sub>2</sub>, and 11<sub>3</sub> are located in the
respective cells 400, 500, and 600, and connected to
mobile stations 21<sub>1</sub>, 21<sub>2</sub>, and 21<sub>3</sub>, respectively, via radio
channels. In FDD, different frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> are
allocated to the uplink, which is directed from the mobile
station to the base station, and the downlink, which is
directed from the base station to the mobile station. The
radio frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> occupy the associated links all
the time, as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the radio
frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> are used equally in all the cells 400,
500, and 600.</p>
    <p num="0004">Fig. 3 illustrates a conventional FDD mobile
communication system. This FDD system includes a base
station 11<sub>1</sub> and a mobile station 21<sub>1</sub>. The base station 11<sub>1</sub> 
has a signal processing unit 80 connected to the backbone
network (e.g., mobile communication network), a
transmitter 81, a receiver 82, a band pass filter (BPF) 83
with a center frequency of f<sub>1</sub>, a band pass filter (BPF) 84
with a center frequency of f<sub>2,</sub> and antennas 85, 86
connected to the receiver 82 and the transmitter 81,
respectively.</p>
    <p num="0005">The mobile station 21<sub>1</sub> has an input unit 70 (e.g.,
microphone 70a or keyboard 70b), an output unit 71 (e.g.,
display 71a or speaker 71b), a signal processing unit 72,
a transmitter 73, a receiver 74, a band pass filter (BPF)
75 with a center frequency of f<sub>1</sub>, a band pass filter (BPF)
76 with a center frequency of f<sub>2</sub>, and antennas 77, 78
connected to the transmitter 73 and the receiver 74,
respectively.</p>
    <p num="0006">In operation of the mobile station 21<sub>1</sub>, digital
signals supplied from the input unit 70 are converted to
baseband signals by the signal processing unit 72. The
baseband signals are converted to radio signals by the
transmitter 73, which then pass through the band pass
filter 75. Radio signal components of center frequency f<sub>1</sub>
are extracted by the band pass filter 75, and the signals
are transmitted from the antenna 77 to the base station
11<sub>1</sub> at a frequency f<sub>1</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0007">The radio signals transmitted from the mobile
station 21<sub>1</sub> are received by the antenna 85 of the base
station 11<sub>1</sub>, and supplied to the receiver 82 via the band
pass filter 83. The received radio signals are converted
to baseband signals, and the baseband signals are then
converted to digital signals by the signal processing unit
80. The digital signals are transmitted to the backbone
network, such as a mobile communication network.</p>
    <p num="0008">On the other hand, in the downlink, digital 
signals received by the base station 11<sub>1</sub> from the backbone
network are converted to baseband signals by the signal
processing unit 80, and then converted to radio signals by
the transmitter 81. The band pass filter 84 extracts only
those signal components with a center frequency of f<sub>2</sub>,
which are then transmitted to the mobile station 21<sub>1</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0009">The radio signals transmitted from the base
station 11<sub>1</sub> are received by the antenna 78 of the mobile
station 21<sub>1</sub>, and supplied to the receiver 74 via the band
pass filter 76. The radio signals are converted into
digital signals through the receiver 74 and the signal
processing unit 72, and supplied to the output unit 71.</p>
    <p num="0010">In FDD, radio communication is carried out by
allocating different frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> to the uplink
(from the mobile station 21<sub>1</sub> to the base station 11<sub>1</sub>) and
the downlink (from the base station 11<sub>1</sub> to the mobile
station 21<sub>1</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0011">Figs. 4-7 illustrate the concept of conventional
TDD communication. In conventional TDD, the same radio
frequency is used on the uplink and the downlink, unlike
FDD. As illustrated in Fig. 4, base stations 12<sub>1</sub>-12<sub>14</sub> are
located in the respective cells 700-713. In this cell
structure, a mobile station 22<sub>1</sub>, which is under management
of the base station 12<sub>1</sub>, is connected to a mobile station
22<sub>2</sub>, which is under management of the base station 12<sub>2</sub> by
means of TDD communication. In TDD, three or more
frequencies (f<sub>1</sub>-f<sub>3</sub>) are allocated alternately and
repeatedly to the cells (#1-#3). This arrangement is
required to guarantee a sufficient spatial distance
between those cells that use the same radio frequency in
order to preclude interference from the neighborhood cells.
Each frequency allocated to one of the cells #1-#3 is used
for the uplink and the downlink alternately each at an 
equal time interval. The time period allocated to the
alternate links is called a time slot.</p>
    <p num="0012">Fig. 6 illustrates a conventional TDD mobile
communication system. This TDD system includes a base
station 12<sub>1</sub> and a mobile station 22<sub>1</sub>. The base station 12<sub>1</sub>
has a signal processing unit 120 connected to the backbone
network (e.g., mobile communication network), a
transmitter 122, a receiver 123, a switch (SW) 124, a band
pass filter (BPF) 125 with a center frequency of f<sub>1</sub>, and
an antenna 126 for transmitting and receiving radio
signals.</p>
    <p num="0013">The mobile station 22<sub>1</sub> has an input unit 110,
such as a microphone 110a or a keyboard 110b, an output
unit 111, such as a display 111a or a speaker 111b, a
signal processing unit 112, a transmitter 114, a receiver
115, a switch (SW) 116, a band pass filter (BPF) 117 with
a center frequency of f<sub>1</sub>, and an antenna 118 for
transmitting and receiving radio signals.</p>
    <p num="0014">In operation of the mobile station 22<sub>1</sub> in the
TDD system, digital signals supplied from the input unit
110 are converted to baseband signals by the signal
processing unit 112. The baseband signals are converted to
radio signals by the transmitter 114, which then pass
through the switch (SW) 116 and the band pass filter (BPF)
117. Radio signal components of center frequency of f<sub>1</sub> are
extracted, and are transmitted from the antenna 118 to the
base station 12<sub>1</sub> at a frequency f<sub>1</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0015">The radio signals transmitted from the mobile
station 22<sub>1</sub> are received by the antenna 126 of the base
station 12<sub>1</sub>, and supplied to the receiver 123 via the band
pass filter (BPF) 125 and the switch (SW) 124. The
received radio signals are converted to digital signals by
the receiver 123 and the signal processing unit 120. The 
digital signals are then transmitted to the backbone
network.</p>
    <p num="0016">On the other hand, in the downlink, digital
signals received at the base station 12<sub>1</sub> from the backbone
network are converted to radio signals by the signal
processing unit 120 and the transmitter 122. The radio
signals pass through the switch (SW) 124 and the band pass
filter (BPF) 125, in which only those signal components
with a center frequency of f<sub>1</sub> are extracted. The radio
signals of frequency f<sub>1</sub> are transmitted from the antenna
126 to the mobile station 22<sub>1</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0017">The radio signals transmitted from the base
station 12<sub>1</sub> are received by the antenna 118 of the mobile
station 22<sub>1</sub>, supplied to the receiver 115 via the band
pass filter (BPF) 117 and the switch (SW) 116. The radio
signals are converted into digital signals through the
receiver 115 and the signal processing unit 112, and
supplied to the output unit 111.</p>
    <p num="0018">The switching controllers 121 and 113 of the
base station 12<sub>1</sub> and the mobile station 22<sub>1</sub>, respectively,
superpose control signals on the downlink communication
signals so that the base station 12<sub>1</sub> and the mobile
station 22<sub>1</sub> synchronize with each other. The switching
controllers 121 and 113 switch the switches (SWs) 124 and
116, respectively, based on the control signal supplied
from the signal processing unit 120 of the base station.</p>
    <p num="0019">With this arrangement, during uplink
communication, the signal processing unit 120 of the base
station 12<sub>1</sub> stops supplying signals to the transmitter 122.
Accordingly, the transmitter 122 of the base station 12<sub>1</sub>
and the receiver 115 of the mobile station 22<sub>1</sub> suspend
operations. On the other hand, during the downlink
communication, the signal processing unit 112 of the 
mobile station 22<sub>1</sub> stops supplying signals to the
transmitter 114. Accordingly, the transmitter 114 of the
mobile station 22<sub>1</sub> and the receiver 123 of the mobile
station 12<sub>1</sub> suspend operations.</p>
    <p num="0020">In recent years, the volume of data transmitted
in mobile radio communication has increased greatly.
Unlike voice communication on telephone lines, data
communication is likely to produce asymmetric situations
in the volume of data between the uplink and the downlink.
In particular, as browser phones, which are cellular
phones allowing the users to access homepages uploaded in
servers on the Internet or use electronic mail, have
rapidly spread, digital contents is frequently downloaded
from the servers set by providers. As a result, the data
amount transmitted on the downlink is likely to be larger
than that on the uplink.</p>
    <p num="0021">In the conventional duplex method (either FDD or
TDD), even if the data amount on the downlink is much
larger than that on the uplink because of asymmetric
transmission volume, an equal radio frequency or a time
slot has to be allocated to the uplink and the downlink.
For this reason, the radio resources, such as a time slot
or a frequency band, are wasted. Besides, since the radio
frequency band allocated to mobile radio communication is
limited, the transmission capacity of the system is also
restricted.</p>
    <p num="0022">Accordingly, it is an important requirement to
eliminate waste of radio resources so as to maximize
deterioration of the transmission capacity of the system
in the limited radio frequency band. From this viewpoint,
the 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which is an
organization that investigates technological standards of
IMT-2000, has proposed asymmetric duplex as illustrated in 
Fig. 7.</p>
    <p num="0023">In this method, a series of frames (F#1, F#2,...
F#n), each consisting of a plurality of time slots (for
example, four in the example of Fig. 7), are provided. The
numbers of time slots allocated to the uplink and the
downlink are set asymmetric in order to cope with
asymmetric data volume on the uplink and the downlink.</p>
    <p num="0024">However, this asymmetric duplexing is unsuitable
to a large-capacity mobile communication system because
data are transmitted in the same radio frequency band in
both the uplink and the downlink, and therefore, a
continuing wide range of frequency bands must be
guaranteed. Unfortunately, the allocated radio frequency
bands are overcrowded, and it is difficult to obtain a
continuing wide range of frequency bands.</p>
    <p num="0025">Another problem arises if TDD is applied to W-CDMA
systems, and if the data volumes in the uplink and
the downlink become asymmetric. In asymmetric TDD-type A-CDMA,
as the volume of the communication data increases,
high-speed processing is required in generating clock
frequencies for the baseband signal and modulating the
baseband signal to a radio signal. This causes the
structures of both the mobile terminal and the base
station to be complicated.</p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0026">Therefore, it is an object of the present
invention to provide a mobile communication system that
can realize an efficient use of the radio frequency
resources without complicating the structure, even if the
data volume is asymmetric in parallel transmissions on the
uplink and the downlink.</p>
    <p num="0027">To achieve the object, in one aspect of the 
invention, a mobile communication system includes a base
station, and a mobile station configured to communicate
with the base station using a radio frequency. This mobile
communication system has a first communication mode, a
second communication mode, a third communication mode, and
a mode switcher that switches the first through third
communication mode in accordance with data transfer
volumes on the uplink and the downlink. In the first
communication mode, a first radio frequency is used for an
uplink and a second radio frequency is used for a downlink.
In the second communication mode, the first radio
frequency is used for the uplink, and the second radio
frequency is shared by the uplink and the downlink. In the
third communication mode, the second radio frequency is
used for the downlink, and the first radio frequency is
shared by the uplink and the downlink.</p>
    <p num="0028">If the communication volumes on the uplink (from
the mobile station to the base station) and the downlink
(from the base station to the mobile station) are
symmetric, the first mode is selected. If the
communication volumes on the uplink and the downlink
become asymmetric, the mode is switched to the second or
the third communication mode, in which either the first or
second radio frequency is used for bidirectional
communication (e.g., for both the uplink and the downlink)
in a duplex manner. With this mobile communication system,
radio resources required for radio communication is
allocated efficiently to both symmetric and asymmetric
communication.</p>
    <p num="0029">In another aspect of the invention, a mobile
communication system that can easily cope with increase of
the data transfer volume on the uplink is provided. This
mobile communication system includes a base station and a 
mobile station configured to communicate with the base
station, and it has a first communication mode, a second
communication mode, and a mode switcher that switches the
first and second communication modes in accordance with
data transfer volumes on the uplink and the downlink. In
the first communication mode, a first radio frequency is
used for an uplink and a second radio frequency is used
for a downlink. In the second communication mode, the
first radio frequency is used for the uplink, and the
second radio frequency is shared by the uplink and the
downlink.</p>
    <p num="0030">If the data transfer volume on the uplink
increases, the communication mode is switched to the
second mode, in which the up channel communication and the
down channel communication are switched in a duplex manner
at the same second frequency. Since the mode switching
causes the downlink frequency (e.g., the second frequency)
to be used in a duplex manner, the mode control operation
is simplified, without causing the structures of the base
station and the mobile station to be complicated.</p>
    <p num="0031">In still another aspect of the invention, a
mobile communication system that can easily cope with
increase of the data transfer volume on the downlink is
provided. This mobile communication system includes a base
station and a mobile station configured to communicate
with the base station using a radio frequency, and it has
a first communication mode, in which a first radio
frequency is used for an uplink and a second radio
frequency is used for a downlink, and a second
communication mode, in which the second radio frequency is
used for the downlink and the first radio frequency is
shared by the uplink and the downlink. The system also has
a mode switcher configured to switch the first and second 
communication modes in accordance with data transfer
volumes on the uplink and the downlink.</p>
    <p num="0032">In yet another aspect of the invention, a base
station configured to communicate with a mobile terminal
in a prescribed geographical is provided. The base station
communicates with the mobile terminal using at least two
of a first communication mode in which a first radio
frequency is used for an uplink and a second radio
frequency is used for a downlink; a second communication
mode in which the first radio frequency is used for the
uplink, and the second radio frequency is shared by the
uplink and the downlink; and a third communication mode in
which the first radio frequency is shared by the uplink
and the downlink and the second radio frequency is used
for the downlink. The base station comprises a signal
processing unit configured to produce a control signal for
designating one of the communication modes, and a
switching controller configured to receive the control
signal and change the communication mode based on the
control signal.</p>

      <u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0034">The details of the preferred embodiment of the
invention will now be described with reference to the
attached drawings.</p>
    <p num="0035">Fig. 8 illustrates an example of the cell
structure of the mobile communication system according to
an embodiment. The mobile communication system comprises
base stations (BS1-BS3) 10<sub>1</sub>-10<sub>3</sub> positioned in cells 100,
200, 300, respectively, and mobile stations (MS1-MS3) 201-20<sub>3</sub>
connected to the associated base stations 10<sub>1</sub>-10<sub>3</sub> via
radio communication to achieve voice communication, non-telephone
communication, and other types of communication.</p>
    <p num="0036">In this system, radio frequency f<sub>1</sub> is used on
the uplink from the mobile stations 20<sub>1</sub>-20<sub>3</sub> to the base
stations 10<sub>1</sub>-10<sub>3</sub>, and radio frequency f<sub>2</sub> is used on the
downlink from the base stations 10<sub>1</sub>-10<sub>3</sub> to the mobile
stations 20<sub>1</sub>-20<sub>3</sub>. These frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> are equally
used in all the cells.</p>
    <p num="0037">Figs. 9A-9C illustrate three types of
communication modes used in the mobile communication
system in an embodiment. In this example, one of the three
modes is selected depending on the communication volumes
on the uplink and the downlink. These three modes include
the FDD mode (Fig. 9A), the FDD/TDD mixed mode A (Fig.
9B), and the FDD/TDD mixed mode B (Fig. 9C)</p>
    <p num="0038">If the data volume on the uplink (from the
mobile station to the base station) is almost the same as
that on the downlink (from the base station to the mobile
station), the FDD mode is selected. In the FDD mode, for
example, frequency f<sub>1</sub> is used exclusively for the uplink, 
and frequency f<sub>2</sub> is used exclusively for the downlink. This
mode is similar to the conventional FDD technique.</p>
    <p num="0039">If the data volume on the downlink becomes
greater than that on the uplink, the mode is switched to
the FDD/TDD mixed mode A, in which the uplink frequency f<sub>1</sub>
is shared between the uplink and the downlink, while the
downlink frequency f<sub>2</sub> is still used exclusively for the
downlink. In other words, the downlink channel and the
uplink share the uplink frequency f<sub>1</sub> in alternate time
slots, as in the TDD technique. In the example shown in
Fig. 9B, the time slots (intervals) for the uplink and the
downlink communication are set equal, and the data
capacity ratio of the uplink to the downlink becomes 1 to
3 (1:3).</p>
    <p num="0040">If the data volume on the downlink becomes
smaller than that on the uplink, the FDD/TDD mixed mode B
is selected. In this mode, the uplink frequency f<sub>1</sub> is used
exclusively for the uplink, and the downlink frequency f<sub>2</sub>
is shared between the uplink and the downlink in alternate
time slots, as in TDD. In this case, the communication
ratio of the uplink to the downlink is 3 to 1 (3:1).</p>
    <p num="0041">By switching these three modes depending on the
situation, the system can deal with the asymmetric radio
communication.</p>
    <p num="0042">Fig. 10 illustrates the mobile communication
system according to an embodiment, which includes a mobile
station 20<sub>1</sub> and a base station 10<sub>1</sub>. The mobile station 20<sub>1</sub>
has an input unit 31, such as a microphone 31a or a
keyboard 31b, an output unit 32, such as a display 32a or
a speaker 32b, a signal processing unit 33, a switching
controller 34, a serial to parallel converter (S/P) 35,
and a parallel to serial converter (P/S) 36. The mobile
station 20<sub>1</sub> also has two transmitters 37 and 38, two
receivers 39 and 40, two switches (SW1 and SW2) 41 and 42,
a first band pass filter (BPF) 43 with a center frequency 
of f<sub>1</sub>, a second band pass filter (BPF) 44 with a center
frequency of f<sub>2</sub>, and two antennas 45 and 46. Each antenna
is used for both transmitting and receiving radio signals.</p>
    <p num="0043">The base station 10<sub>1</sub> has a signal processing
unit 50 connected to the backbone network (e.g., mobile
communication network), two transmitters 51 and 52, a
parallel to serial converter (P/S) 54, a serial to
parallel converter (S/P) 55, and two receivers 56 and 57.
The base station 10<sub>1</sub> also has two switches (SW1 and SW2)
58 and 59, a first band pass filter (BPF) 60 with a center
frequency of f<sub>1</sub>, a second band pass filter (BPF) 61 with a
center frequency of f<sub>2,</sub> and antennas 62, 63, each antenna
used for both transmitting and receiving radio signals.</p>
    <p num="0044">In operation, a digital signal input from the
input unit 31 of the mobile station 20<sub>1</sub> is converted to a
baseband signal by the signal processing unit 33, and
divided into two lines of baseband signals by the serial
to parallel converter 35. These baseband signals are
converted to radio signals by the first and second
transmitters 37 and 38. The radio signals are supplied to
the first and second band pass filters (BPS) 43 and 44 via
the first and second switches (SW1 and SW2) 41 and 42,
respectively. The first band pass filter 43 extracts the
signal component of frequency f<sub>1</sub>, and the second band pass
filter 44 extracts the signal component of frequency f<sub>2</sub>.
These radio signals of frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> are to be
transmitted to the base station 10<sub>1</sub> via the antennas 45
and 46, respectively.</p>
    <p num="0045">The radio signals transmitted from the mobile
station 20<sub>1</sub> at frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> are received by the
associated antennas 62 and 63, and supplied to the first
and second receivers 56 and 57, respectively, via the
associated band pass filters 60 and 61, and the associated 
switches 58 and 59. The radio signals are converted to
baseband signals by the receivers 56 and 57, and
synthesized by the parallel to serial converter (P/S) 54.
The composite baseband signal is converted to a digital
signal by the signal processing unit 50, and transmitted
to the backbone network.</p>
    <p num="0046">On the downlink, the digital signal supplied
from the backbone network is converted to a baseband
signal by the signal processing unit 50. The baseband
signal is divided into two lines of baseband signals by
the serial to parallel converter (S/P) 55, and then
converted to radio signals by the associated transmitters
51 and 52. These two radio signals pass through the
associated switches (SW1 and SW2) 58 and 59, and the
associated band pass filters (BPFs) 60 and 61. The first
band pass filter 60 extracts only the signal component of
frequency f<sub>1</sub>, and the second band pass filter 61 extracts
only the signal component of frequency f<sub>2</sub>. These radio
signals are transmitted to the mobile station 20<sub>1</sub> from the
associated antennas 62 and 63.</p>
    <p num="0047">The radio signals transmitted from the base
station 10<sub>1</sub> at frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> are received by the
associated antennas 45 and 46 of the mobile station 20<sub>1</sub>,
and supplied to the receivers 39 and 40 via the associated
band pass filters 43 and 44, and the switches (SW1 and
SW2) 41 and 42, respectively. The radio signals are then
converted to baseband signals by the receivers 39 and 40.
The two lines of baseband signals are synthesized by the
parallel to serial converter (P/S) 36. The composite
signal is converted to a digital signal by the signal
processing unit 33, and output to the output unit 32.</p>
    <p num="0048">The switching controller 53 of the base station
10<sub>1</sub> and the switching controller 34 of the mobile station 
20<sub>1</sub> superpose control signals on the downlink to allow the
base station 10<sub>1</sub> and the mobile station 20<sub>1</sub> to synchronize
with each other. Under the synchronization, the switching
controllers 53 and 34 switch the communication mode of the
system based on the control signal supplied from the
signal processing unit 50 of the base station 10<sub>1</sub>. The
switching controllers 53 and 34, and the signal processing
unit 50 constitute a mode switcher.</p>
    <p num="0049">In other words, based on the control signal from
the signal processing unit 50, the switching controllers
53 and 34 regulate operations of the first switches (SW1)
58 and 41, the second switches (SW2) 59 and 42, the serial
to parallel converters (S/P) 55 and 35, and the parallel
to serial converters (P/S) 54 and 36 in three different
manners illustrated in Figs. 11-13.</p>
    <p num="0050">With the data volume on the uplink almost the
same with that on the downlink, the mobile communication
system operates in the FDD mode, as illustrated in Figs.
11 A and 11B. In the FDD mode, radio frequency f<sub>1</sub> is used
exclusively for the uplink, and radio frequency f<sub>2</sub> is used
exclusively for the downlink, as illustrated in Fig. 11A.
The control signal generated by the signal processing unit
50 of the base station 10<sub>1</sub> contains commands for
regulating the first switches (SW1) 58 and 41, the second
switches (SW2) 59 and 42, the serial to parallel
converters (S/P) 55 and 35, and the parallel to serial
converters (P/S) 54 and 36, so that the mobile station 20<sub>1</sub>
transmits at frequency f<sub>1</sub> and receives at frequency f<sub>2</sub>, and
that the base station receives at frequency f<sub>1</sub> and
transmits at frequency f<sub>2</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0051">To be more precise, in the mobile station 20<sub>1</sub>,
the first switch (SW1) 41 is connected to the transmitter
A (37), and the second switch (SW2) 42 is connected to the 
receiver B (40), as illustrated in Fig. 11B. No serial to
parallel conversion is carried out by S/P converter 35,
and all the signals from the signal processing unit 33 are
supplied to the transmitter A (37). Similarly, no parallel
to serial conversion is carried out by P/S converter 36,
and all the signals received at the receiver B (40) are
supplied to the signal processing unit 33.</p>
    <p num="0052">On the other hand, in the base station 10<sub>1</sub>, the
first switch (SW1) is connected to the receiver A (56),
and the second switch (SW2) is connected to the
transmitter B (52). No serial to parallel conversion is
carried out by S/P converter 55, and all the signals from
the signal processing unit 50 are supplied to the
transmitter B (52). Similarly, no parallel to serial
conversion is carried out by P/S converter 54, and all the
signals received at the receiver A (56) are supplied to
the signal processing unit 50.</p>
    <p num="0053">If the data volume on the downlink becomes
greater than that on the uplink, the mode is changed to
the FDD/TDD mixed mode A, as illustrated in Figs. 12A and
12B. In this mode, radio frequency f<sub>1</sub> on the uplink is
shared by the up channel and the down channel in the time
division duplex (TDD) manner, as illustrated in Fig. 12A.
The control signal generated by the signal processing unit
50 of the base station 10<sub>1</sub> contains control commands for
regulating the first switches (SW1) 58 and 41, the second
switches (SW2) 59 and 42, the serial to parallel
converters (S/P) 55 and 35, and the parallel to serial
converters (P/S) 54 and 36<sub>,</sub> so that the base station 10<sub>1</sub>
transmits and the mobile station 20<sub>1</sub> receives at frequency
f<sub>2</sub>, and that the uplink frequency f<sub>1</sub> is used alternately by
the base station 20<sub>1</sub> and the mobile station 10<sub>1</sub> to transfer
data between them. </p>
    <p num="0054">To be more precise, in the mobile station 10<sub>1</sub>,
the first switch (SW1) 41 is switched alternately between
the transmitter A (37) and the receiver A (39), and the
second switch (SW2) 42 is connected to the receiver B (40),
as illustrated in Fig. 12B. No serial to parallel
conversion is carried out by S/P converter 35, and all the
signals from the signal processing unit 33 are supplied to
the transmitter A (37). Parallel to serial conversion is
carried out by P/S converter 36 so that the signal ratio
of the receiver A (39) to the receiver B (40) becomes 1 to
2 (1:2).</p>
    <p num="0055">In the base station 10<sub>1</sub>, the first switch (SW1)
58 is switched alternately between the receiver A (56) and
the transmitter A (51), and the second switch (SW2) 59 is
connected to the transmitter B (52). Serial to parallel
conversion is carried out by S/P converter 55 so that the
signal ratio of the transmitter A (51) to transmitter B
(52) becomes 1 to 2 (1:2). No parallel to serial
conversion is carried out by P/S converter 54, and the all
the signals from the receiver A (56) are supplied to the
signal processing unit 50.</p>
    <p num="0056">If the data volume on the uplink becomes greater
than that on the downlink, the mode is changed to the
FDD/TDD mixed mode B, as is illustrated in Figs. 13A and
13B. In this mode, the downlink frequency f2 is shared by
the up channel and the down channel in the time division
duplex (TDD) manner, as illustrated in Fig. 13A. The
control signal generated by the signal processing unit 50
of the base station 10<sub>1</sub> contains control commands for
regulating the first switches (SW1) 58 and 41, the second
switches (SW2) 59 and 42, the serial to parallel
converters (S/P) 55 and 35, and the parallel to serial
converters (P/S) 54 and 36, so that the base station 10<sub>1</sub> 
transmits and the mobile station 20<sub>1</sub> receives at frequency
f<sub>1</sub>, and that the downlink frequency f<sub>2</sub> is used alternately
by the base station 20<sub>1</sub> and the mobile station 10<sub>1</sub> to

    <p num="0057">To be more precise, in the mobile station 10<sub>1</sub>,
the first switch (SW1) 41 is connected to the transmitter
A (37), and the second switch (SW2) is switched
alternately between the transmitter B (38) and the
receiver B (40), as illustrated in Fig. 13B. Serial to
parallel conversion is carried out by S/P converter 35 so
that the signal ratio of the transmitter A (37) to
transmitter B (38) becomes 2 to 1 (2:1). No parallel to
serial conversion is carried out by P/S converter 36, and
the all the signals from the receiver B (40) are supplied
to the signal processing unit 33.</p>
    <p num="0058">In the base station 10<sub>1</sub>, the first switch (SW1)
58 is connected to the receiver A (56), and the second

conversion is carried out by P/S converter 54 so that the
signal ratio of the receiver A (39) to the receiver B (40)
becomes 2 to 1 (2:1).</p>
    <p num="0059">In this manner, the mobile communication system
according to the embodiment changes the communication mode
depending on the data volumes on the uplink and the
downlink. With the substantially equal data volumes
between the uplink and the downlink, radio frequencies f<sub>1</sub>
and f<sub>2</sub> are used exclusively for the uplink and the downlink,
respectively. With the uplink data volume increased over
the downlink data volume, the downlink frequency f<sub>2</sub> is 
shared between the uplink and the downlink in the TDD
manner. With the downlink data volume increased over the
uplink data volume, then the uplink frequency f<sub>1</sub> is shared
between the uplink and the downlink in the TDD manner, so
that the up channel communication and the down channel
communication are carried out alternately. With this
arrangement, the radio resources are appropriately
allocated to the links in accordance with the data volumes
on the uplink and the downlink. As a result, the radio
resources are utilized efficiently.</p>
    <p num="0060">The mode switcher, which comprises the signal
processing unit 50 of the base station 10<sub>1</sub> and the
switching controllers 53 and 34, also controls the time
slot allocation ratio between the uplink and the downlink.
In the example shown in Fig. 9B, the time slots of the
uplink frequency f<sub>1</sub> are allocated to the uplink and the
downlink alternately at the same ratio. However, this
allocation rate may be adjusted in accordance with the
data transfer volumes in the uplink and downlink. For
example, the time slots may be allocated to the uplink and
the downlink at a ratio of 1 to 2, so that the up channel
uses frequency f<sub>1</sub> one of every three time slots. In this
case, the signal processing unit 50 generates a control
command that regulates the switchers, the transmitters,
the receivers, the P/S converters, and the S/P converters
so as to operate at an appropriate timing and ratio.</p>
    <p num="0061">Although the explanation has been made using an
example in which the three communication modes are used,
only two of them may be used. For example, the FDD mode
and the FDD/TDD mixed mode A are used and the radio
communication may be switched between these two modes if
the downlink generally has a heavy traffic. Alternatively,
the FDD mode and the FDD/TDD mixed mode B are used if the 
uplink traffic is generally heavy.</p>
    <p num="0062">Next, the mode switching technique will be
explained in more detail below. The mode change described
above may be implemented in cooperation with any one or
any combination of the means described below.</p>
    <heading>(1) Remote Monitoring Controller</heading>
    <p num="0063">Fig. 14 illustrates a modification of the base
station 10<sub>1</sub>, which carries out mode switching. The signal
processing unit 50 includes a remote monitoring controller
(RMC) 50a and a control signal generator (CSG) 50b. The
remote monitoring controller 50a receives via the backbone
network a monitoring control signal from, for example, a
monitoring station that monitors the data transfer volumes
on the uplink and the downlink. The remote monitoring
controller 50a selects an appropriate mode from the FDD
mode, FDD/TDD mixed mode A, and FDD/TDD mixed mode B
illustrated in Figs. 11-13, based on the received
monitoring signal.</p>
    <p num="0064">The selected mode is supplied to the control
signal generator 50b. The control signal generator 50b
generates a control signal based on the selected mode. The
control signal is supplied to the switching controller 53,
which then switches the first and second switches (SW1 and
SW2) 58 and 59, and controls the operations of the P/S
converter 54 and the S/P converter 55, in an appropriate
manner. This control signal is supplied to the switching
controller 34 of the mobile station 20<sub>1</sub> on the downlink,
and it causes the switching controller 34 to control the
connections of the switches (SW1 and SW2) 41 and 42 and
the operations of the S/P converter 35 and the P/S
converter 36.</p>
    <heading>(2) Time Management Controller</heading>
    <p num="0065">Fig. 15 illustrates another modification of the 
base station 10<sub>1</sub>. The switching controller 53 has a time
schedule table (TST) 53a. In this modification, the
switching controller 53 functions also as a time
management controller. For example, the monitoring station
takes statistics of the time-varying data volumes on the
uplink and the downlink, and makes up a time schedule of a
day or a week for mode change in advance, based on the
statistics result. The time schedule is incorporated in
the switching controller 53. The switching controller 53
controls the connections of the switches (SW1 and SW2) 58
and 59 and the operations of the P/S converter 54 and the
s/P converter 55. Although not illustrated in Fig. 15, a
corresponding time schedule (i.e., a time schedule table)
is also incorporated in the switching controller 34 of the
mobile station 20<sub>1</sub>. Thus, the communication mode of the
mobile communication system is automatically switched in
accordance with the prescribed time schedule.</p>
    <heading>(3) Communication Observation Controller</heading>
    <p num="0066">Fig. 16 illustrates still another modification
of the base station 10<sub>1</sub>. The signal processing unit 50 has
a control signal generator (CSG) 50b and a communication
observation controller 50c. The communication observation
controller 50c includes a communication volume monitoring
(CVM) unit 50d for measuring the communication volumes on
the uplink and the downlink, and a comparator 50e for
comparing the measurements of the uplink and the downlink.
The comparison result is supplied to the control signal
generator (CSG) 50b, which generates a control signal for
causing the switching controller 53 to appropriately
switch the connection states of the switches (SW1 and SW2)
58 and 59 and the operations of the P/S converter 54 and
the S/P converter 55. Although not illustrated in Fig. 16,
the control signal is supplied to the switching controller 
34 of the mobile station 20<sub>1</sub>, and the switches 41 and 42,
the S/P converter 35, and the P/S converter 36 are
appropriately controlled. With this arrangement, mode
control centralizes in each of the base stations 10<sub>1</sub>-10<sub>3</sub>
(Fig. 8), using the measuring results obtained at the base
station.</p>
    <p num="0067">The mode switch operations may be carried out
independently among the base stations 10<sub>1</sub>-10<sub>3</sub>, or
alternatively, all of or some neighborhood base stations
may change the communication mode in synchronization with
each other in order to prevent interference in carrier
propagation. In the latter case, the transmitters 51, 52
and the receivers 56, 57 of the base station 10<sub>1</sub>, and the
receivers 39, 40 and the transmitters 37, 38 of the mobile
station 20<sub>1</sub> synchronize with each other. In addition, if
the FDD/TDD mixed mode A or B is selected, the up channel
communication and the down channel communication may be
switched using the same frequency after the base stations
of all of or some neighborhood cells are synchronized with
each other.</p>
    <p num="0068">The mode switcher of the mobile communication
system is not limited to the above-described examples. For
example, a system manager that monitors and manages the
mobile communication system may manually switch the
communication mode of the system.</p>
    <p num="0069">Fig. 17 illustrates another example of the cell
structure. In this frame structure, adjacent cells use
different combinations of radio frequencies. For example,
cell 100 uses frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub>, the adjacent cell 200
uses frequencies f<sub>2</sub> and f<sub>3</sub>, and another adjacent cell 300
uses frequencies f<sub>2</sub> are f<sub>4</sub>. This arrangement can
effectively prevent interference, which may occur in the
cell structure shown in Fig. 8, in which the same 
frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> are used in all the cells. With the
cell structure of Fig. 8, if the downlink data volume
becomes greater than the uplink data volume, and therefore,
uplink frequency f<sub>1</sub> is used in the TDD manner, then, the
base station may receive radio frequency f<sub>1</sub> from the
adjacent cell, which causes undesirable interference. By
allocating different frequencies to the adjacent cells, as
illustrated in Fig. 17, signal interference can be
prevented effectively in the mobile communication system.</p>
    <p num="0070">Preferably, the switching timing of the switches
41, 42, 58, 59 of the mobile station 10<sub>1</sub> and the base
station 20<sub>1</sub>, and the signal ratio defined by the serial to
parallel converters 35, 55 and the parallel to serial
converters 36, 54 are adjusted more finely. This
arrangement allows the system to cover possible
contingencies in the asymmetric data communication between
the uplink and the downlink, and consequently, the
resource utilization efficiency can be further improved.</p>
    <p num="0071">Basically, the mobile communication system
described in the embodiment operates in the FDD manner,
and uses the TDD method as required depending on the data
transfer volumes on the uplink and the downlink.
Consequently, the mobile communication system does not
require the clock rate and the modulation rate to be
extremely increased, unlike in the conventional asymmetric
TDD system, and the system structure, including the signal
processing units and the transmitters/receivers of the
base station and the mobile station, can be simplified.</p>
    <p num="0072">Although the invention has been described using
specific examples, the present invention is not limited to
those examples, but includes many substitutions and
modifications without departing from the scope of the
invention. For example, although in the embodiment three 
communication modes are used, two of these modes (for
example, the FDD mode and the FDD/TDD mixed mode A, or the
FDD mode and the FDD/TDD mixed mode B) may be used. In
this case, the mode switcher switches the system operation
between the selected two modes.</p>
