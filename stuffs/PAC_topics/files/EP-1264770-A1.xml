  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a unit intended
for the application of printed slips to packets in
packaging machines.</p>
    <p num="0002">In particular, and to advantage, the invention
finds application in machines for manufacturing
packets of cigarettes, the field to which reference
is made explicitly in the following specification
albeit with no limitation implied, whilst the term
"printed slip" is used to indicate a coupon, plain
or folded, or a label or revenue stamp, of the kind
typically associated with such packets.</p>
    <p num="0003">Printed slips of the type in question are in most
cases either cut from a continuous strip or drawn
from a stack of diecuts. The machines by which the
slips are applied will obviously be equipped with
different feed devices according to the manner in
which the slips are procured. In the case of folded
coupons, in particular, these can be cut from a
continuous strip folded previously along one or
more longitudinal crease lines and decoiled thus 
from a roll, or alternately, the folding operation
can be carried out at the moment when the strip is
decoiled and fed to the machine.</p>
    <p num="0004">Conventionally, a cigarette packer can be used
both for the production of articles furnished with
printed slips cut from a continuous strip, and for
the production of articles furnished with slips
procured in the form of diecuts. Obviously, given
the high operating speeds and outputs of machines
in use today, and the high profitability expected
of them, the changeover from one type of production
to another on the same packer will be economically
justifiable only when the conversion of the machine
from the one type of operation to the other can be
accomplished in a relatively short time.</p>
    <p num="0005">The prior art embraces packer machines equipped
with devices designed to feed printed slips either
from a continuous strip or from the bottom of a
vertical magazine, operating in conjunction with
respective devices by which the slips are picked up
and applied to the packets, wherein the changeover
from one type of feed system to another is effected
by replacing both the feed and the pickup devices.</p>
    <p num="0006">As a result, cigarette packers currently in use
are rendered less adaptable to different types of 
slips and to their corresponding feed systems, and
consequently less profitable.</p>
    <p num="0007">The object of the present invention is to provide
a unit for the application of printed slips in
packaging machines, from which the aforementioned
drawbacks can be eliminated.</p>
    <p num="0008">The stated object is realized, according to the
invention, in a unit for applying printed slips to
packets in packaging machines, characterized in
that it includes first means by which to feed slips
procurable as single items ordered in a stack, or
second means by which to feed slips obtainable as
cuts made from a continuous strip, and a universal
pickup and application device installed permanently
in the machine, such as will take up the slips with
equal facility from either the first or the second
feed means at a pickup station.</p>
    <p num="0009">The invention will now be described in detail, by
way of example, with the aid of the accompanying
drawings, in which:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>figure 1 shows a portion of a packer machine,

    <p num="0010">Referring to figure 1 of the drawings, 1 denotes
a portion, in its entirety, of a packaging machine,
and 2 denotes a unit, likewise in its entirety, for
the application of detachable printed slips 3 to
packets 4 of substantially parallelepiped shape,
for example of the type with a hinged lid.</p>
    <p num="0011">The portion 1 of the machine is equipped with a
conveyor denoted 5 in its entirety, by which the
packets 4 are received at an infeed section 6 and
advanced in succession along a predetermined feed
path P in a given direction F toward a station 7 at
which a slip 3 is applied to each packet 4 by the
unit 2 aforementioned, and thereafter toward an
overwrapping machine represented schematically as a
block 8, by which the packets 4 are overwrapped in
transparent plastic material (a familiar operation
not illustrated in the drawings).</p>
    <p num="0012">The application unit 2 comprises a pickup and
application device denoted 9 in its entirety, which
is positioned immediately above the application
station 7.</p>
    <p num="0013">The device 9 is of universal design, installed
permanently on the machine in a fixed position, and
can be supplied with slips 3 at a pickup station 10 
by first feed means 11 or by second feed means 12
consisting respectively in a first feed device 11
or a second feed device 12. The devices 11 and 12
in question are interchangeable accessories, shown
schematically in figure 1 in positions not as yet
fitted to the application unit 2, so as to indicate
the facility of using one or other device 11 or 12
according to the requirement.</p>
    <p num="0014">Observing figures 1 and 2, the first device 11
for feeding the printed slips 3 will be seen to
include a magazine 13 with a substantially vertical
axis 14 positionable on a vertical bulkhead 15 of
the application unit 2, and more exactly fixed to a
mounting point 16 indicated by a phantom outline in
figure 1.</p>
    <p num="0015">The magazine 13 is designed to hold a stack 17 of
slips 3 removable one by one from a bottom end 18
of the selfsame magazine when fixed to the mounting
point 16 and positioned thus with the bottom end 18
facing the pickup station 10.</p>
    <p num="0016">Observing figures 1 and 3, the second device 12
for feeding the printed slips 3 will be seen to
include a decoiling unit 19 by which a continuous
strip 20 of material is drawn from a roll 21, and a
feed unit 22 comprising a suction roller 23 located 
downstream of the decoiling unit 19, in relation to
the direction of the running strip 20, by which the
selfsame strip 20 is diverted along a substantially
horizontal direction D coinciding with a plane 24
that lies parallel with and in close proximity to a
reference plane 25 of the pickup station 10</p>
    <p num="0017">Importantly, it will be observed also that the
position of the reference plane 25 relative to the
pickup station 10 remains the same in the event of
the first feed device 11 being utilized.</p>
    <p num="0018">The second device 12 further comprises a cutter
unit 26 presenting a fixed blade 27 and a movable
blade 28, positioned in sequence along the feed
direction D followed by the advancing strip 20,
respectively below and above the plane 24 occupied
by the strip 20.</p>
    <p num="0019">The movable blade 28 of the cutter unit 26 is
pivotable about an axis 29 normal to the vertical
bulkhead 15 between a raised non operating position
indicated in figure 4, distanced from the plane 24
and affording a passage to a portion 30 of the
strip 20 indexed forward by the suction roller 23,
and a lowered operating position of interaction
with the fixed blade 27, indicated in figure 5, in
which the aforementioned portion 30 of strip 20 
constituting one slip 3 is cut and transferred into
a position occupying the same plane as the pickup
station 10.</p>
    <p num="0020">With reference to figures 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8, the
aforementioned pickup and application device 2
includes a pickup assembly 31 of the type disclosed
in US Patent 5,775,062, to which reference may be
made for a full description. Such an assembly 31
comprises at least one pickup mechanism 32 with an
aspirating sector 33 having a cylindrical outer
pickup surface 33a centred on an axis 34 normal to
the vertical bulkhead 15, which is designed to pick
up a single slip 3 from the first feed device 11 or
alternatively from the second feed device 12, at a
point coinciding with the reference plane 25 of the
pickup station 10. The pickup mechanism 32 is made
to advance at constant speed along a predetermined
path P1, through the agency of a carrier device 35
mounted to a power driven shaft 36 of which the
axis is denoted 37. The mechanism 32 comprises a
plurality of suction cups 38 occupying a part of
the aspirating sector 33 of the outer surface 33a,
aligned parallel with the aforementioned axis 34
and connected to a conventional source of negative
pressure (not indicated), and able thus to attract 
and retain a single slip 3 on the surface 33a. More
exactly, and as described in US Patent 5,775,062,
the pickup mechanism 32 is caused to rotate about
the axis 37 of the carrier device 35 in such a way
that the outer surface 33a rolls tangentially to
the reference place 25 of the pickup station 10,
engaging progressively in contact with a slip 3
positioned at the bottom end 18 of the magazine 13
or under the movable blade 28 of the cutter unit 26
when in the lowered operating position. Thus, the
suction cups 38 make contact by degrees with the
slip 3, which is transferred gradually away from
the station 10.</p>
    <p num="0021">Thereafter, the mechanism 32 is advanced by the
carrier device 35 along the aforementioned path P1,
moving clockwise as viewed in the drawing, toward a
release position 39.</p>
    <p num="0022">The unit 2 disclosed also presents an application
assembly 40 located below the pickup assembly 31,
interposed between the latter assembly 31 and the
conveyor 5. This further assembly 40 operates in
conjunction with the pickup assembly 31 and is
equipped with a drum 41 rotatable about an axis 42
parallel to the axis 37 of the pickup assembly 31
between the release position 39 and a position 43, 
coinciding with the application station 7, in which
a slip 3 is applied to the relative packet 4. The
drum 41 carries three angularly equidistant second
pickup mechanisms 44, pneumatic in operation, which
as discernible in figures 2, 3, 7 and 8 comprise a
cylindrical surface 45 concentric with the axis 42
of rotation, and two suction cups 46 positioned one
on either side of the surface 45, connected to a
source of negative pressure not illustrated in the
drawings.</p>
    <p num="0023">The second pickup mechanisms 44 are designed to
interact with the aspirating sector 33 of the first
pickup mechanism 32 at the release position 39,
where the slips 3 are transferred from the suction
cups 38 of the first mechanism 32 to the suction
cups 46 of the second mechanisms 44.</p>
    <p num="0024">During the course of the transfer, the suction
cups 38 and 46 describe a rolling movement relative
to the slip 3, devoid of sliding contact not least
by virtue of their elastic deformability, and are
also offset one from the another rather than being
mutually opposed.</p>
    <p num="0025">More particularly, the drum 41 rotates about its
axis 42 in an anticlockwise direction, as viewed in
the drawing, in such a manner as to transfer the 
slips 3 along a path P2 tangential to the path P
followed by the packets 4 on the conveyor 5 and
affix one slip 3 to a corresponding face of each
packet 4 at the application station 7, at least one
dab of adhesive having been deposited on the slip 3
by a gumming device 47 positioned along the path P2
followed by the mechanisms 44 (see figure 1).</p>
    <p num="0026">As discernible in figures 1 and 12, the packets 4
lie flat on the conveyor 5 as they proceed along
the feed path P, advancing with their longitudinal
axes 48 set transversely to the feed direction F,
whilst the printed slips 3, which in figures 9, 10
and 11 appear substantially rectangular and are
referable to a relative longitudinal axis 49, are
applied to the packets 4 each with the longitudinal
axis 49 parallel to the longitudinal axis 48 of the
packet 4.</p>
    <p num="0027">Assuming that the slips 3, whether picked up from
the magazine 13 by the first feed device 11 or cut
from a strip 20 and picked up consequently by the
second feed device 12, are directed into the pickup
station 10 with their longitudinal axes 49 disposed
parallel to the axes 49 of the packets 4 advancing
along the conveyor 5, then the subsequent transfer
of each slip 3 from the pickup station 10 to the 
application station 7 can be effected without any
need for a change of orientation.</p>
    <p num="0028">Conversely, in the event that the slips 3 enter
the pickup station 10 with their respective axes 49
disposed transversely to the longitudinal axes 48
of the packets 4, and therefore parallel to the
feed direction F followed by the packets 4 on the
conveyor 5, then the orientation must be changed
during the passage from the pickup station 10 to
the application station 7 in order to bring the
axes 49 into a position substantially of parallel
alignment with the axes 48 of the single packets 4.</p>
    <p num="0029">To this end, the drum 41 can be equipped as in
the alternative embodiment of figure 6 with three
angularly equidistant second pickup mechanisms 50,
pneumatic in operation and comprising two suction
cups 46 similarly to the first mechanisms 44, but
differing from the first in that they are mounted
to respective shafts 51 rotatable about respective
radial axes 51a through the agency of conventional
mechanical linkages (not illustrated) in such a way
as to manoeuvre the suction cups 46 from a position
of alignment on a line 60 parallel to the transfer
path P2 to a position in which the selfsame line 60
is disposed transversely to the transfer path P2, 
thereby rotating the slips 3 through 90°.</p>
    <p num="0030">This would be the procedure in case of the slip 3
illustrated in figure 10, which is folded along
crease lines extending parallel to the longitudinal
axis 49 and cut from a continuous strip 20 along
lines transverse to the selfsame axis 49.</p>
    <p num="0031">In the case of the slip 3 shown in figure 11,
which is folded along crease lines transverse to
the longitudinal axis 49 and for example cut from a
strip 20 along lines parallel to the axis 49, or
cut previously and stacked in a magazine 13, the
orientation of the axes 49 on entering the pickup
station 10 will be transverse to the feed path P1
and thus parallel to the axes 48 of the packets 4;
in this instance the unit 2 comprises first and
second guiding and locating means 52 and 53, as
illustrated in figure 8, positioned between the
pickup station 10 and the release position 39,
serving to ensure that the folded slips 3 are
transferred correctly.</p>
    <p num="0032">In particular, the first such guide means 52
comprise an arcuate element 54 associated with the
end of a bracket 55 rigidly attached to the carrier
device 35 and designed to prevent the overlapping
leaves of the folded slip 3 from opening out and 
becoming detached, whilst the second guide means 53
comprise an L-shaped plate 56 fixed at one end to
the frame 57 of the relative feed device 11 or 12.</p>
    <p num="0033">The plate 56 in question presents a free end 58
disposed parallel to the feed path P1, of which the
function is to prevent relative movement between
the overlapping leaves of the folded slip 3.</p>
    <p num="0034">It will be observed that the second vacuum pickup
mechanisms 50 might be mounted permanently to the
second pickup assembly 40 and activated only when
effectively necessary for the reasons indicated.</p>
    <p num="0035">In addition, the aspirating sector 33 of the
first pickup assembly 31 might present a plurality
of holes 59 rather than suction cups 38, as in the
example of figure 7, connected likewise to a source
of negative pressure (not illustrated).</p>
