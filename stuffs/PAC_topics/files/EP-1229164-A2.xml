    <p>The invention relates to a distributor device for

    <heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
    <p num="0001">The invention relates to a distributor device according
to the preamble of Patent Claim 1.</p>
    <heading>PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="0002">A number of distributor devices for low and medium
consistency pulp are known, these distributor devices
being intended to form a uniform pulp web.</p>
    <p num="0003">Most distributor devices for cellulose pulp use very
simple solutions which do not guarantee an even
distribution of the pulp across the entire width of the
web. Wash presses in most cases simply use pulp
troughs, of the types disclosed in US 5,667,642, SE-A-9303382-7,
SE-C-503010 and SE-C-501710 where the trough
runs across the entire width of the web which is to be
formed. Here, the drum on which the web is formed is
allowed to entrain the pulp, which is in most cases
done in a non-uniform manner and without positively
acting distributor members in the distributor device.
If wash liquid is additionally added from a gap which
extends across the entire pulp web, this has the result
that the wash effect is uncontrolled. The non-uniform
pulp web formed then has non-uniform packing across its
width, and as the water is introduced into a gap the
water tends to pass through the pulp bed where it has
the lowest degree of packing.</p>
    <p num="0004">SE-A-9102370 discloses another device with a rotating
cross-slit rotor arranged in the inlet. Here, the
cross-slit rotor does not afford any positive
distribution effects. </p>
    <p num="0005">US 4,085,003 discloses a variant with a uniform
throttle valve along the entire distributor device.
This valve cannot guarantee an even distribution across
the width of the entire web.</p>
    <p num="0006">SE-C-448009 discloses a distributor device in which the
pulp is conveyed into an inlet at the end of a
cylindrical distributor housing. A feed screw with
continuously increasing core diameter, as seen from the
inlet, then feeds the pulp out through a gap which
extends across the entire web which is to be formed.
This solution functions very well with an outlet gap
which is arranged in the upper half of the distributor
housing, i.e. within positions of the outlet gap
between 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock on the distributor
housing. The feed screw, which has a continuously
increasing core diameter as seen from the inlet,
contributes to the pulp maintaining uniform pressure
towards the outlet slit, after which the pulp is tapped
off from the outlet slit, at the same time as the feed
screw keeps the outlet free.</p>
    <p num="0007">SE-C-500546 discloses another solution in which the
pulp is fed into the middle of a distribution box and
is then forced to flow across the upper edge of an
upwardly convex crescent-shaped distribution plate. The
shape of the plate is intended to prevent most pulp
being distributed on the web at the inlet, where the
pressure is at its greatest. However, in practical
application, it has been found that the pulp tends to
be poorly distributed at the web edges. In addition,
the same crescent shape does not give the same effect
at different consistencies, since lower consistencies
mean that the pulp flows more easily out to the edges
of the crescent and does not build up the same height
at the inlet.</p>
    <p num="0008">The abovementioned solutions are an indication of the 
large number of proposals which have been considered
and have been applied in practice in distributor
devices for cellulose pulp from a low consistency of 2
to 5 % and up to a medium consistency in the range of
about 12 to 14%. Most of these solutions have not taken
fully into consideration the importance of ensuring
optimum uniform distribution of the pulp across the
whole width of the pulp web. Only SE-C-448009 discloses
a solution where a forced physical distribution of the
pulp is obtained. As soon as a lower degree of packing
of the pulp occurs in the pulp web, this has the effect
that the flow of wash liquid for treating the pulp web
is concentrated in these areas where there is a low
degree of packing, which results in non-uniform
treatment and an uneven quality of the treated pulp.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0009">The object of the invention is to obtain an optimum
uniformly formed pulp web when feeding cellulose pulp
in the consistency range of 2 to 14%. A bed which is
packed uniformly across the entire width of the pulp
web means that subsequent treatment, preferably
washing/displacement wash, of the pulp web takes place
uniformly, so that an even quality of pulp is obtained.</p>
    <p num="0010">This object is achieved with the features which are set
out in the characterizing clause of Patent Claim 1.</p>
    <p num="0011">Another object is to obtain a distributor device with a
high level of operability, i.e. minimal operational
faults, and which is easy to start up with less need or
no need for cleaning, dilution, or emptying of the
distributor device. The invention has its main
application in wash presses for cellulose pulp of the
type which is disclosed in SE-C-512753, where the
distributor device is arranged at the very top of a
dewatering drum, and where the outlet forming the pulp
web from the distributor device is directed downwards 
from the distributor device. The concept illustrated in
SE-C-512753 initially utilizes gravitational forces for
maximum dewatering effect when the pulp is softest
(lowest concentration), at the same time as the
available wash zone extends optimally across the
greatest possible extent of the drum, typically over
270 degrees.</p>
    <p num="0012">The invention ensures that the pulp at a consistency of
2 to 12% does not flow out in an uncontrolled manner to
the pulp web around the pulp inlet from the distributor
device, at which inlet the pressure is at its highest.
This effect is most marked in the preferred embodiment
where the outlet holes are arranged in the lower part
of the jacket surface of the distributor housing. The
interaction with the feed screw which, in a preferred
embodiment, has its thread crests sweeping closely
across the outlet holes, guarantees that the outlet
holes are kept free without any risk of becoming
clogged.</p>
    <p num="0013">Further characteristics, aspects and advantages of the
invention will become clear from the attached patent
claims and from the following detailed description of a
number of embodiments.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0015">Figure 1 shows a wash press 1 in which cellulose pulp
of low consistency in the range of 2 to 12% is fed to
the inlets 6a, 6b of the wash press.</p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">Wash press construction - general</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0016">The wash press is of a type which is disclosed in SE-C-512753
in which the pulp is distributed via two inlets
on respective dewatering drums 2a, 2b. By means of an
initial distribution at the highest point of the drum,
at 12 o'clock, an optimum initial dewatering is
obtained by using gravitational forces, and at an
initial stage when the cellulose pulp has its lowest
consistency.</p>
    <p num="0017">The pulp web 21 is distributed on each drum 2a, 2b and
runs between drum and trough sweep over an angle range
greater than 240 degrees, and at most 270 degrees,
which gives the possibility of an extremely long
treatment zone over each drum.</p>
    <p num="0018">The pulp webs 21 finally meet in a press nip 22 formed
between the drums where a last dewatering effect is
obtained. Normally a consistency of 30% or more can be
obtained after the press nip, and the washed and
dewatered pulp is collected by a feed screw 13.</p>
    <p num="0019">This innovative construction principle of the wash
press permits excellent treatment of the pulp at a
given drum size. The concept permits a high wash
capacity for the small available surface in the pulp
mill, for which reason it is well suited for upgrading
existing plants. </p>
    <p num="0020">The wash press forms the pulp web 21 between the
perforated and dewatered outer surface of the drum 2a,
2b and the surrounding trough sweep, of which a first
section consists of pivotable trough sweeps 10a, 10b
and a final sweep section consists of a raisable and
lowerable trough base 11. The first sections can have
weakly converging trough sweeps with one or more wash
liquid distributors 12 arranged transverse to the pulp
web.</p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">The distributor device according to the invention</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0021">Each distributor housing 3a, 3b for each drum comprises
a feed screw 4a, 4b arranged in the cylindrical
distributor housing with its cylinder axis arranged
horizontally and transverse to the pulp web 21.</p>
    <p num="0022">Figure 2 shows one distributor housing seen from above
in Figure 1. The feed screw 4a, 4b is provided with a
screw thread 15 with a substantially constant pitch,
and a screw core 14 with a continuously increasing core
diameter as seen from the inlet 6a, 6b, corresponding
to that shown in SE-C-448009. The distributor housing
can, as is shown in SE-C-448009, have an inlet at one
end of the distributor housing, but in Figure 2 the
inlet is arranged at the middle of the distributor
housing, and the screw thread 15 of the feed screw is
mirror-inverted as seen from the centre of the inlet
for conveying the pulp out towards the end walls of the
distributor housing.</p>
    <p num="0023">In this way it is possible to obtain a uniform pressing
force on the pulp remaining in the distributor housing,
where the remaining annular space for the pulp
decreases continuously in the feed direction of the
screw. A compensation is thus obtained for the pulp
which is fed out nearest the pulp inlet 6a, 6b. </p>
    <p num="0024">An alternative to a continuously increasing diameter of
the screw core 14 can be a continuously decreasing
pitch of the screw thread 15.</p>
    <p num="0025">The screw is mounted 20 at each end and is driven by a
motor 5, where the feed screw is arranged with its axis
of rotation parallel to the cylinder axis of the
distributor housing and is arranged to feed pulp from
the inlet 6a, 6b and along the entire length of the
distributor housing in the direction of its cylinder
axis.</p>
    <p num="0026">The figure also shows a shorter counter thread at the
end of the distributor housing, where a counter pumping
effect is obtained which is intended to counter the
formation of plugs. This counter thread can be
completely or partially omitted depending on the
tendency of the pulp to form plugs and/or possible
interaction with cleaning nozzles which are activated
for a short time during stoppage or plugging
tendencies. The counter thread can also be placed in an
area of the housing outside the width of the web
formed.</p>
    <p num="0027">Figure 3 shows how the outlets from the distributor
housing are arranged in the manner according to the
invention. Instead of a gap extending across the entire
housing, as is shown in SE-S-448009, the outlet
consists of holes 7 arranged along the generatrix of
the distributor housing, in the jacket surface of said
distributor housing 3a, 3b, and with a defined hole
diameter D, and where the holes are arranged at a
distance X from each other.</p>
    <p num="0028">The holes do not need to be so close when the pulp is
relatively easy-flowing under the conditions which
prevail under the action of the feed screw. The
distance X between the holes expediently exceeds the
hole diameter. </p>
    <p num="0029">Tests have shown that a good distribution function is
obtained with holes having a diameter of 40 mm, which
holes are separated by a distance of 75 mm. The hole
size and the spacing can vary, however, around these
dimensions without unacceptably affecting the
distribution function. The hole diameter can therefore
vary within the range of 20 to 60 mm, and the distance
between the holes can vary within the range of 40 to 90
mm, while the distance between the holes is at least
150% of the hole diameter.</p>
    <p num="0030">In certain applications with pulp in the lower range of
consistency, i.e. 2 to 5%, and/or in the case of a high
initial feed pressure of the pulp, the holes can also
be given a continuously increasing hole diameter as
seen in the direction of feed of the feed screw 4a, 4b
and from the inlet of the distributor housing. Such a
design can give a certain throttle effect for the pulp
which flows out in the holes 7 arranged nearest to the
inlet 6a, 6b. In combination with an increasing core
diameter of the feed screw (alternatively an increasing
pitch of the thread), it is thus possible to obtain a
uniform outflow across the entire width of the
distributor housing.</p>
    <p num="0031">As will be seen from Figure 1, the outlets are
arranged, for maximum initial dewatering effect, at the
top of the wash press, with the outlets 7 arranged in
the lower part of the distributor housing, directed
substantially straight downwards from the distributor
housing. The holes are intended to prevent pulp from
falling freely down towards the pulp web, and the holes
form a pressure drop which gives the pulp the
possibility of being distributed across the entire
distributor housing before being fed out from the
housing. The holes are preferably arranged in the
lowest part of the jacket surface of the distributor
housing directed substantially straight down from the 
distributor housing around a position corresponding to
6 o'clock, and within an area of rotation in the range
of ± 45 degrees from this position.</p>
    <p num="0032">Figure 4 shows the interaction between the thread 15 of
the feed screw 4a, 4b and the outlet holes 7 in the
inner jacket surface of the distributor housing 3a, 3b.
The thread 15 of the feed screw 4a, 4b sweeps with its
crests across the holes 7 at a predefined distance Y
from the holes 7 in the inner jacket surface of the
distributor housing. This interaction maintains
continuous exposure of the holes. This is very
advantageous when restarting after shutdown, as plug
formations may have developed in and around the holes
7.</p>
    <p num="0033">The distance Y can be relatively large, up to 20 mm for
consistencies in the upper range of 7 to 12%, without
this exposure effect disappearing entirely. However,
the distance Y can be optimized as a function of the
actual consistency, where the optimum distance
decreases as consistency increases.</p>
    <p num="0034">The distance Y preferably lies in the range of 5 to 20
mm and is more preferably 10 ± 2 mm.</p>
    <p num="0035">The invention can be modified within the scope of the
attached patent claims. For example, the holes can be
arranged offset a slight distance either side of the
generatrix of the jacket surface.</p>
    <p num="0036">The outlet holes 7 from the distributor device can also
be provided as tubular sleeve couplings nearest the
distributor housing, with transition to an elliptic
cross section at the outlets nearest the pulp web, and
where the major axis of all elliptic cross sections is
parallel.</p>
    <p num="0037">The outlet holes nearest the distributor housing can 
also be slightly elliptic, the mean value of the minor
axis and major axis corresponding to the hole diameter
specified in this application. Each distributor device
forming a pulp web can also contain two or more
distributor housings with two or more separate inlets
for each distributor housing.</p>
