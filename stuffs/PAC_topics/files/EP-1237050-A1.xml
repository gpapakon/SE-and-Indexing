      <u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <heading>1. Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a developer regulating
member for regulating a developer and to a developing
apparatus including the same. More particularly, it relates
to a developer regulating member and to a developing apparatus
suitable for use in an electrophotographic type image forming
apparatus, for example, a copying machine, a printer or a
facsimile machine.</p>
    <heading>2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">Hitherto, in such a type of image forming apparatus,
an electrostatic latent image formed on an image bearing
member has been visualized as a toner image by a developing
apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0003">As such a developing apparatus, for example, a dry
one-component contact developing apparatus has been proposed
and put to practical use. In this case, mostly, an
electrostatic latent image is developed by pressing or
contacting a rotating electrostatic latent image bearing
member with a similarly rotating toner carrying member
(developer carrying member) at a suitable relative
peripheral velocity difference. In addition, the apparatus
has many advantages. For example, no magnetic material is
required so that the apparatus can be easily simplified and 
miniaturized. Furthermore, use of non-magnetic toner makes
it possible to apply the apparatus to a full color image
forming apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0004">As the toner carrying member, a developing roller having
elasticity and conductivity can be used. That is, since
development is conducted by pressing or contacting it with
the electrostatic latent image bearing member, the
developing roller is made of an elastic material in order
to prevent the electrostatic latent image bearing member
from being damaged especially when it is a rigid member.</p>
    <p num="0005">Also, the developing roller may be used by providing
a conductive layer on a surface thereof or in the vicinity
of the surface and applying a developing bias.</p>
    <p num="0006">Further, for the purpose of imparting charges to the
toner and forming a uniform thin layer of toner, a developing
blade as a development regulating member may be abutted to
the toner carrying member. In this case, it is possible to
use an elastic blade made of rubber or a metallic thin plate
having spring elasticity as the developing blade.</p>
    <p num="0007">Fig. 8 shows a conventional developing apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0008">A developing roller 81, which is a toner carrying member,
is an elastic roller having conductivity, which has a base
layer of silicone rubber having coated thereon acrylic
urethane based rubber as a surface layer. It is rotatively
driven in the direction as indicated by an arrow A.</p>
    <p num="0009">A developing blade 82 is supported by a blade supporting
sheet metal 83, and the vicinity of the leading end on the 
free end side of the developing blade contacts face to face
with the peripheral surface of the developing roller 81.</p>
    <p num="0010">Further, an elastic roller 84 is abutted to the
developing roller 81 and is rotatively driven in the direction
indicated by an arrow B. The elastic roller 84 is a sponge
roller and is intended to supply toner to the developing
roller 81 and scrape away the toner remaining on the developing
roller undeveloped. The elastic roller 84 is arranged on
the upstream side of the developing blade 82 in the rotational
direction of the developing roller 81.</p>
    <p num="0011">Toner 85 is a non-magnetic one-component developer.
For the purpose of improving charging property and transfer
property of toner, a suitable amount of hydrophobic silica
is externally added.</p>
    <p num="0012">In the developing apparatus of the above-mentioned
structure, a satisfactory thin layer of the non-magnetic
toner 85 can be formed on the developing roller 81 and an
electrostatic latent image on the bearing member can be
satisfactorily developed.</p>
    <p num="0013">However, in the conventional technology as described
above, it is desired to use toner having a smaller particle
size or having an ensphered configuration for further
improvement of high quality image. Repeating development
operation by using such toner caused a problem in that an
image failure of number of fine streaks is generated when
a thin plate of metal such as SUS or phosphor bronze is used
as a developing blade. </p>

      <u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0014">The present invention has been made in view of the above,
and an object of the present invention is to provide a
developer regulating member and a developing apparatus for
forming a uniform layer of developer on a developer carrying
member.</p>
    <p num="0015">Another object of the present invention is to provide

in which the occurrence of a streak-like image failure in
images is prevented.</p>
    <p num="0016">Another object of the present invention is to provide

which can form satisfactory images even when toner having
a reduced particle size or toner having an ensphered

      <u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0019">Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present
invention will be described in detail by way of examples.
However, the size, material and shape as well as relative
disposition of components described in the embodiment should
be varied as appropriate depending on the structure of the 
apparatus to which the present invention is applied and
various conditions, and the present invention should not
be limited to the following embodiments.</p>
    <p num="0020">Fig. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view showing an
image forming apparatus 10 to which the present invention
is applied. Fig. 2 is a schematic cross-sectional view
showing a developing apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0021">First image forming operation will be explained by using
an image forming means.</p>
    <p num="0022">In Fig. 1, a photosensitive drum 11 as an electrostatic
latent image bearing member rotates in the direction
indicated by an arrow A. First, the photosensitive drum 11
is uniformly electrified by a charging apparatus 12.
Thereafter, it is exposed to laser light 13 from a laser
optical apparatus that is an exposure means to thereby form
an electrostatic latent image on the surface thereof.</p>
    <p num="0023">The electrostatic latent image is developed by a
developing apparatus 14 arranged so as to be contacted with
the photosensitive drum 11 and pressed against it to a
predetermined depth to be visualized as a toner image.</p>
    <p num="0024">The visualized toner image on the photosensitive drum
11 is transferred to a recording medium 16 as a transferring
material by a transfer roller 15. The transfer residual
toner that has not been transferred and remained on the
photosensitive drum 11 is scraped away by a cleaning blade
17, which is a cleaning member, and contained in a waste
toner container 18. The cleaned photosensitive drum 11 is 
repeatedly subjected to the above operation to perform image
formation.</p>
    <p num="0025">On the other hand, the recording medium 16 on which
the toner image has been transferred is permanently fixed
by a fixing apparatus 19 and discharged to the outside of
the apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0026">The developing apparatus 14 will be further described
with reference to Fig. 2.</p>
    <p num="0027">In Fig. 2, reference numeral 21 designates a developing
container containing negatively charged non-magnetic toner
22 as a non-magnetic one-component developer. The
developing apparatus 14 is provided with a developing roller
23 as a developer carrying member positioned at an opening
portion longitudinally extending in the developing apparatus
21 and arranged so as to oppose the photosensitive drum 11
so that the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive
drum 11 can be developed and visualized.</p>
    <p num="0028">The photosensitive drum 11 is a rigid member that
includes an aluminum cylinder as a base and a photosensitive
layer coated therearound to a predetermined thickness. Upon
forming an image, the photosensitive drum 11 is uniformly
electrifled to a charge potential of Vd = -700 V by the charging
apparatus and a portion exposed with laser based on an image
signal is electrified to a charge potential of Vl = -150
V. To the Vl portion, direct current voltage of Vdc = -400
V is applied as a developing bias to a core metal of the
developing roller 23 and the electrostatic latent image is 
subjected to reversal developing with the negatively charged
toner.</p>
    <p num="0029">The developing roller 23, which has elasticity, is
arranged transversely such that a substantially right half
circumference thereof is plunged into the developing
container 21 and a substantially left half circumference
thereof is exposed from the developing container 21. The
surface exposed from the developing device 21 is opposed
against the photosensitive drum 11 positioned leftward of
the developing apparatus 14 so as to be contacted with and
pressed against it to a predetermined depth. In this
embodiment, the developing roller 23 is contacted with the
photosensitive drum 11 and pressed against it to a depth
of 50 µm.</p>
    <p num="0030">The developing roller 23 is rotatively driven in the
direction indicated by an arrow B. Its surface has
appropriate unevenness in order to increase the possibility
of rubbing and friction with the toner 22 and well perform
transfer of the toner 22. In this embodiment, the developing
roller 23 has a double layer structure including a base layer
made of silicone rubber having coated on a surface thereof
with acrylic urethane based rubber. It has a surface
roughness of Rz (ten point average roughness) = 10 µm and
a resistance of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> Ω.</p>
    <p num="0031">Here, the method of measuring resistance will be
described. The developing roller 23 is abutted to an aluminum
sleeve having an identical diameter with that of the 
photosensitive drum 11 at an abutting load of 500 gf. The
aluminum sleeve is rotated at an identical peripheral
velocity with that of the photosensitive drum 11. In this
embodiment, the photosensitive drum 11 is rotated at a
peripheral velocity of 90 mm/sec and has a diameter of 30
mm while the developing roller 23 rotates at a peripheral
velocity faster than that of the photosensitive drum 11,
i.e., 120 mm/sec and has a diameter of 20 mm. Then, a direct
current voltage of -400 V, which is identical with the
developing bias in this embodiment, is applied to the
developing roller 23. On this occasion, current is
calculated by providing a resistor of 10 kΩ on the ground
side and measuring the voltage across it, thereby calculating
the resistance of the developing roller 23.</p>
    <p num="0032">Below the developing roller 23, an elastic roller 24
is abutted and rotatably supported. It is preferred that
the elastic roller 24 is of a sponge structure or of a fur
brush structure made of a core metal having flocked fabric
of fiber such as rayon or nylon in consideration of supply
of toner to the developing roller 23 and scraping away of
undeveloped toner therefrom. In this embodiment, the
elastic roller 24 is a urethane sponge roller, which is
rotatively driven in the same direction as the developing
roller 23. The core metal, which is a rotation axis of the
elastic roller, is at an identical potential with that of
the developing roller 23. Therefore, when an electrostatic
latent image on the photosensitive drum 11 is developed, 
an identical voltage as the developing bias will be applied
to it.</p>
    <p num="0033">In this embodiment, for the negatively charged
non-magnetic toner 22 as a one-component developer,
reduction in a particle size has been achieved in order to
obtain high image quality, and substantially spherical toner
is used in order to increase transfer efficiency. More
specifically, toner having shape factors SF-1 of 100 to 180
and SF-2 of 100 to 140 is used.</p>
    <p num="0034">The shape factors SF-1 and SF-2 are defined as the values
obtained by the following formulas. More specifically, 100
toner images are randomly sampled with the use of Hitachi
FE-SEM (S-800), and the obtained image data is introduced,
for analysis, into an image analyzer (Luzex3: product of
Nikoret Co.) through an interface.
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center">SF-1={(MXLNG)<st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup>/AREA}×(π/4)×100</st32:df><st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center">SF-2={(PERI)<st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup>/AREA}×(π/4)×100</st32:df>
(wherein MXLNG: absolute maximum length, AREA: projected
area of toner, and PERI: peripheral length).</p>
    <p num="0035">The surface factor SF-1 of toner represents degree of
sphericity, and the greater the SF-1 of an object is relative
to 100, the less spherical, or more undefined, the shape
of the object is. The surface factor SF-2 represents degree 
of unevenness of a surface, and the greater the SF-2 of an
object is relative to 100, more uneven the surface of the
object is.</p>
    <p num="0036">As to a method of manufacturing the toner, no particular
method is sticked to, provided that the toner can keep the
shape factors within the aforementioned ranges. For example,
it is possible to perform plastic ensphering treatment of
the surface of conventional pulverized toner by means of
thermal or mechanical stress, or it is possible to use a
method for directly producing toner with the use of the
suspension polymerization method, a dispersion
polymerization method for directly producing toner with the
use of hydrous organic solvent in which monomer is soluble,
but polymer is insoluble, an emulsion polymerization method,
for example, a soap-free polymerization method for directly
producing toner in the presence of water soluble, polar,
polymerization initiator, or the like.</p>
    <p num="0037">In this embodiment, a suspension polymerization method
under the normal pressure or increased pressure is used.
According to this method, it is possible to relatively easily
control the shape factors SF-1 and SF-2 of the toner within
ranges of 100-180 and 100-140, respectively, and also it
is possible to obtain toner having a particle size within
a range of 4 to 8 µm and having a sharp particle size
distribution. Also, negatively charged toner having a
weight average particle size of about 7 µm and containing
25% or less of toner partides having a weight average particle 
size of 4 µm or less is produced from a combination of styrene
and n-butyl acrylate, as a monomer, a metallic salicylate
compound as a charge controlling agent, a saturated polyester
as polar resin, and also a coloring agent.</p>
    <p num="0038">To measure the weight average particle size of toner,
Coulter counter TAII type or Coulter Multilyzer (produced
by Coulter Corp.) is used. As to the electrolytic solution,
an aqueous 1% NaCl solution is prepared by using first grade
sodium chloride. In 100 to 150 ml of the aqueous electrolytic
solution, 0.1 to 5 ml of a surfactant, preferably
alkylbenzenesulfonic acid salt as a dispersing agent is added
and then 2 to 20 mg of a sample for measurement is added-The
electrolytic solution in which the sample has been
dispersed is subjected to dispersion treatment for about
1 to 3 minutes by using a supersonic disperser. The toner
in the electrolytic solution subjected to the dispersion
treatment is measured by using an aperture of 100 µm in the
a for ementioned measuring apparatus. More specifically, the
volume and number of toner particles of 2 µm or more are
measured to calculate volume distribution and number
distribution, and a weight average particle size D4 is
obtained from the volume distribution.</p>
    <p num="0039">Thereafter, hydrophobic silica as a flowability
improving agent is externally added by 1.5 wt% to the solution.
of course the addition amount is not limited to this. Coating
the surface of toner particles with the external additive
improves negative charge performance, and provision of micro 
interstices between the toner particles achieves improvement
of the flowability.</p>
    <p num="0040">Above the developing roller 23, a developing blade 25
as a developer regulating member having elasticity is
provided so as to be supported by a supporting sheet metal
28 and abuts at its free end side in the vicinity of its
leading end face to face the peripheral surface of the
developing roller 23. The direction of abutment of the
developing blade 25 to the developing roller 23 is in a counter
direction in which the leading end on the free end side is
positioned in the upstream side of the developing roller
23 in the rotational direction with respect to the abutment
portion.</p>
    <p num="0041">The developing blade 25 may be supported on the
supporting sheet metal 28 by fastening with a machine screw
or welding, and the supporting method is not particularly
limited. The developing blade 25 and the supporting sheet
metal 28 are at an identical potential to the developing
roller 23. Therefore, when the electrostatic latent image
on the photosensitive drum 11 is developed, a voltage
identical to the developing bias will be applied.</p>
    <p num="0042">The developing blade 25 has a phosphor bronze metallic
thin plate 26 as a base which is laminated on its entire
surface of abutment with the developing roller 23, that is,
from the leading end on the side supported by the supporting
sheet metal 28 to the free end side which contacts face to
face the peripheral surface of the developing roller 23, 
with polyamide-containing rubber (hereinafter referred to
as polyamide elastomer) 27 as an elastic member.</p>
    <p num="0043">In this embodiment, the developing blade 25 is urged
against the developing roller 23 with a pressure of 25 to
35 g/cm. Also, in consideration of the results described
later on, the thickness of the phosphor bronze metallic thin
plate 26 is set to 120 µm and the thickness of the polyamide
elastomer 27 is set to 80 µm. That is, the thickness of the
elastic member 27 is made thinner than the thickness of the
base 26.</p>
    <p num="0044">The polyamide elastomer is composed of polyamide and
polyether bonded through an ester bond or amide bond.</p>
    <p num="0045">There is no particular lamination on the polyamide
component but nylon-6, nylon-6,6, nylon-6,12, nylon-11,
nylon-12, nylon-12,12, or copolyamides obtained by
polycondensation of monomers thereof, preferably those in
which the terminal amino group of polyamide is carboxylated
with a dibasic acid or the like are used. As the dibasic
acid, saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as oxalic
acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid,
and dodecanedioic acid, unsaturated aliphatic dicarboxylic
acids such as maleic acid, aromatic dicarboxylic acids such
as phthalic acid and terephthalic acid, and polydicarboxylic
acids composed of the above-mentioned dibasic acid and diol
such as ethylene glycol, butanediol, hexanediol, or
octanediol may be used. As the polyether component,
polyethers such as homopolymerized or copolymerized 
polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and
polytetramethylene glycol and polyether diamines in which
both ends have been aminated may be used.</p>
    <p num="0046">The polyamide elastomer used in this embodiment is
obtained by reacting nylon-12 as the polyamide component,
dodecanedioic acid as the dibasic acid, and
polytetramethylene glycol as the polyether component, drying
the product for a predetermined time, and then laminating
it on a phosphor bronze metallic thin plate.</p>
    <p num="0047">Using the above-described image forming apparatus 10
and developing apparatus 14, print out tests of 10,000 sheets
were conducted under normal temperature and normal humidity
(25°C, 60% RH), low temperature and low humidity (15°C, 10%
RH), and high temperature and high humidity (30°C, 80% RH)
environments. As a result, an image of high quality was
obtained with no adhesion of a fused product on the surface
of the developing blade abutting the developing roller and
hence no generation of streak-like images, no generation
of fog due to insufficient triboelectric ability to toner,
and a stable image density with a constant amount of toner
thin layer on the developing roller in the respective
environments.</p>
    <p num="0048">Hereinafter, the contents of the developer regulating
member of the present invention will be described in more
detail.</p>
    <heading>[Experiment 1]</heading>
    <p num="0049">When print out tests were conducted by using a 
conventional developing apparatus, the state of generation
of streak-like images worsened in the order of low temperature
and low humidity (15°C, 10% RH), normal temperature and normal
humidity (25°C, 60% RH) and high temperature and high humidity
(30°C, 80% RH) environments.</p>
    <p num="0050">Observation indicated that a streak-like coating
failure occurred on the developing roller corresponding to
the streak-like image and the fused product was attached
to the developing blade corresponding to the coating failure.
Accordingly, it revealed that, because of the fused product
on the developing blade, toner coating of the developing
roller was disturbed so that a streak-like image failure
occurred. Furthermore, the component of the fused product
was found to be toner and hydrophobic silica.</p>
    <p num="0051">Accordingly, the present inventors considered the
fusion relates to the charge of toner as the developer and
is caused by an electric cause, and fabricated a test apparatus
as shown in Fig. 3.</p>
    <p num="0052">A developing device 30 is substantially the same as
the conventional developing apparatus and is driven by a
driving apparatus (not shown) to have toner as the developer
carried on a developing roller 31. A developing blade 32
is a phosphor bronze metallic thin plate and abuts the
developing roller 31 in a counter direction. A urethane
sponge-made elastic roller 33 abuts the developing roller
31 with being pressed to a predetermined depth and rotates
in the same direction as the developing roller 31. A core 
metal 31A, which is a rotation axis of the developing roller
31, a core metal 33A, which is a rotation axis of the elastic
roller 33, the developing blade 32, and a supporting sheet
metal 34 supporting it are conducting so as to be at an
identical potential and grounded as shown in Fig. 3. Further,
a resistor of 10 kΩ is provided between the developing blade
32 and the ground and the current flowing between the
developing roller 31 and the developing blade 32 is calculated
by measuring the voltages across the resistor.</p>
    <p num="0053">At the same time, the charged amount of toner under
each environment is measured.</p>
    <p num="0054">The method of measuring the charged amount of toner
is performed by using EFV200/300 (produced by Powdertech
Co.) as a carrier and introducing 10.0 g of the carrier and
0.2 g of toner in a 50 ml capacity polyethylene container,
followed by shaking it by the hand 90 times.</p>
    <p num="0055">Then, about 1 g of the aforementioned mixture is placed
in a metallic measuring container 42 having a 500 mesh screen
43 on the bottom as shown in Fig. 4 and a metallic lid is
placed on it. The total weight of the measuring container
42 in this state is defined as W1 (g).</p>
    <p num="0056">Next, the measuring container 42 is placed in an absorber
(having an insulating member corresponding to the portion
where it contacts the measuring container 42) and the air
is sucked through a sucking port 47 at a pressure of 2,450
Pa. In this state, the sucking is continued for 2 minutes,
and the toner is sucked and removed. The potential of a 
potentiometer 49 at this time is defined V (volt). Here,
reference numeral 48 designates a capacitor, whose
capacitance is defined C (mF). The total weight of the
measuring container 42 of the absorber measured is defined
W2 (g).</p>
    <p num="0057">The charged amount of toner T (mC/kg) is obtained
according to the formula
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center">Charged amount T (mC/kg) = C×V/(W1-W2).</st32:df></p>

    <p num="0059">The measured current values and charged amounts of toner
are greater in the order of low temperature and low humidity
(15°C, 10% RH), normal temperature and normal humidity (25°C,
60% RH) and high temperature and high humidity (30°C, 80%
RH) environments, in which order the state of occurrence
of the fused product on the developing blade is worsened.
The current flows from the developing blade 32 to the
developing roller 31.</p>
    <p num="0060">Then, in order to examine the influence of the current
flowing from the developing blade 32 to the developing roller 
31 on the occurrence of the fused product on the developing
blade 32, the resistance of the developing blade 32 was varied.</p>
    <p num="0061">For the measurement of current, the aforementioned test
apparatus was used. Also, the developing blade 32 having
the varied resistance was used in the conventional developing
apparatus and a sheet feeding test of 2,000 sheets was
conducted under low temperature and low humidity (15°C, 10%
RH) environment and the state of occurrence of the fused
product on the developing blade 32 was observed.</p>
    <p num="0062">The resistance of the developing blade 32 was varied
by providing a resistance layer on a metallic thin plate
at the abutment surface between the developing blade 32 and
the developing roller 31 and varying the resistance of the
resistance layer. The resistance layer was adjusted so as
to have a predetermined resistance by dispersing carbon
particles, which are conductive agent, in a phenol resin
in a varied carbon amount.</p>
    <p num="0063">The test results are shown in Table 2. <tables><table><tgroup cols="3"><tbody><row><entry align="center">Resistance (Ω)</entry><entry align="center">Current (µA)</entry><entry align="center">Occurrence of fusion</entry></row><row><entry align="center">0 (Phosphor bronze)</entry><entry align="center">6</entry><entry align="center">Occurred</entry></row><row><entry align="center">10<sup>2</sup></entry><entry align="center">0.1</entry><entry align="center">Slightly occurred</entry></row><row><entry align="center">10<sup>4</sup></entry><entry align="center">0</entry><entry align="center">None</entry></row><row><entry align="center">10<sup>6</sup></entry><entry align="center">0</entry><entry align="center">None</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p>
    <p num="0064">At a resistance of 10<sup>3</sup> Ω or less, a current flow was
detected in the developing blade and fusion occurred at the
abutment surface between the developing blade 32 and the
developing roller 31.</p>
    <p num="0065">The above results indicate that occurrence of fusion
on the developing blade is due to the current that flows
between the developing roller and the developing blade, and
the toner having negative charge attaches to the developing
blade because of its polarity and further fuses to the
developing blade by friction with the developing roller to
cause an image failure.</p>
    <p num="0066">Then, an elastic blade was constructed by using a
polyamide elastomer having a resistance of about 10<sup>9</sup> Ω and
containing a polyamide component having a satisfactory
triboelectric ability to toner having negative polarity and
a polyether component having elasticity.</p>
    <p num="0067">On this occasion, as shown in Fig. 5, a polyamide
elastomer 52 was molded to a thickness of 1 mm on a 100 µm
thick phosphor bronze metallic thin plate 51 having spring
characteristics. More specifically, by using nylon-12 as
the polyamide component obtained by reaction with 
dodecanedioic acid as the dibasic acid and
polytetramethylene glycol as the polyether component, it
was synthesized and after drying for a predetermined time,
it was integrally molded by injection molding using a mold
equipped with the metallic thin plate 51 at a melting
temperature of 200°C and a mold temperature of 30°C.</p>
    <p num="0068">As a result of the sheet feeding test of 10,000 sheets
by using this developing blade under low temperature and
low humidity (15°C, 10% RH) environment, images of good
quality with no fog were obtained with occurrence of no fusion
on the developing blade and with high triboelectric charge
imparting property due to high triboelectric charging
ability of the developing blade itself.</p>
    <heading>[Experiment 2]</heading>
    <p num="0069">However, the results of the sheet feeding tests of 10,000
sheets by using the aforementioned developing blade
including the 100 µm thick phosphor bronze metallic thin
plate having molded thereon polyamide elastomer to a
thickness of 1 mm under low temperature and low humidity
(15°C, 10% RH), normal temperature and normal humidity (25°C,
60% RH) and high temperature and high humidity (30°C, 80%
RH) environments indicated that no attachment of a fused
product occurred in each environment but that in some cases
image density varied from environment to environment.</p>
    <p num="0070">The reason for different image density from environment
to environment was due to the fact that the thickness of
the toner thin layer formed under regulation by the developing 
blade on the developing roller as the toner carrying member
was different from environment to environment. More
specifically, comparison of the weight of toner per unit
area on the developing roller among the environments resulted
as shown in Table 3.

    <p num="0071">To investigate the cause of this, experiments were
conducted repeatedly and the following was found.
<sl><li>(1) When a metallic thin plate made of phosphor bronze or
the like is used as a developing blade, no phenomenon that
the weight of toner per unit area on the developing roller
may differ from environment to environment is observed; and</li><li>(2) In the case of toner with a reduced particle size and
ensphered configuration, the phenomenon that the weight of
toner per unit area on the developing roller differs from
environment to environment is significant.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0072">These results indicate that in the construction in which
the developing roller having elasticity and the developing
blade having rubber elasticity, for example polyamide
elastomer abut to each other at the abutment portion between
the developing blade and the developing roller, when it is 
attempted to regulate toner having a reduced particle size
and ensphered configuration, more specifically, toner having
a weight average particle size of about 7 µm and shape factors
SF-1 of 100 to 180 and SF-2 of 100 to 140 to thereby form
a toner thin layer on the developing roller, the toner on
the developing roller cannot be regulated well by the
developing blade because both the elastic members are
susceptible to deformation and toner having a reduced
particle size and ensphered configuration is used.</p>
    <p num="0073">It revealed that such a construction is susceptible
to influences of changes in toner characteristics from
environment to environment, for example, flowability.</p>
    <p num="0074">In the case where either one of them is a rigid member,
for example, where the developing blade made of a metallic
thin plate is used for the developing roller having elasticity,
the developing blade provided with an elastic member at the
abutment portion with respect to a metallic developing sleeve
can form a stable toner thin layer on the toner carrying
member.</p>
    <p num="0075">To solve this problem, the thickness t of the polyamide
elastomer molded on the metallic thin plate was varied and
the weight of toner per unit area on the developing roller
was measured under each environment.</p>
    <p num="0076">On this occasion, phosphor bronze was used for the
metallic thin plate, which had a thickness of 100 µm. The
abutting pressure between each developing blade and the
developing roller at normal temperature and normal humidity 
was set to 25 g/cm uniformly.</p>
    <p num="0077">The results obtained are shown in Table 4.

    <p num="0078">When the thickness t is 500 µm or more, a difference
in the weight of toner between the low temperature and low
humidity environment in which the weight of toner per unit
area on the developing roller is the largest and the high
temperature and high humidity environment in which the weight
of toner per unit area on the developing roller is the smallest
is 0.3 or more. In contrast, when the thickness t is t =
300 µm or less, such a difference is 0.1 or less. In particular,
when t = 200 µm or less, a difference in the weight of toner
depending on the environment can be said to be substantially
none.</p>
    <p num="0079">The reason for this is that by reducing the thickness
of polyamide elastomer, which is an elastic member, it becomes
difficult to deform as the elastic member and similarly to
the case where a developing blade made of a metallic thin 
plate is used with respect to a developing roller having
elasticity, the toner on the developing roller can be well
regulated by the developing blade even when toner having
a reduced particle size and ensphered configuration is used.</p>
    <p num="0080">Further, experiments were also conducted by using the
aforementioned developing blade with polyamide elastomer
of a thickness t = 2 µm. On this occasion, insulating property
was damaged due to fish eye or bubbles generated at the time
of molding polyamide elastomer, so that the function as a
resistance layer was not achieved. Therefore, fusion
occurred at the defective portion.</p>
    <p num="0081">Accordingly, the range of appropriate thickness of the
elastic body is 5 µm &lt; t &lt; 300µm, preferably 5 µm &lt; t &lt; 200
µm. The shape of the developing blade may be such that an
elastic member 62 is provided over the entire surface from
the leading end of a metallic thin plate 61 on the side
supported by a supporting sheet metal 63 to the free end
side that contacts face to face the peripheral surface of
the developing roller 23.</p>
    <p num="0082">In addition, it is preferred that the toner includes
particles having a weight average particle size of 4 µm or
less in a number percentage of 30% or less. When the number
percentage of particles having a weight average particle
size of 4 µm or less is more than 30%, the toner charge amount
increases so that fusion tends to occur very easily and the
weight average particle size becomes relatively small, so
that it becomes difficult to regulate toner and form a thin 
layer.</p>
    <p num="0083">Based on the results described above, print-out tests
of 10,000 sheets were conducted by abutting a developing
blade, in which polyamide elastomer of a thickness t = 80
µm is integrally molded over the entire surface of a 120
µm thick metallic thin plate, from the leading end of the
metallic thin plate on the side supported by a supporting
sheet metal to the free end side that contacts face to face
the peripheral surface of a developing roller, the developing
roller at an abutting pressure of 30 g/cm and using toner
of which number percentage of toner particles having a weight
average particle size of 4 µm or less is 30% under low
temperature and low humidity, normal temperature and normal
humidity, and high temperature and high humidity
environments. As a result, a stable, uniform toner thin
layer could be formed without generating streak-like image
due to fused product from the beginning to the end. Thus,
stable, satisfactory image quality of which the image density
showed no variation from the environment to the environment
could be obtained.</p>
    <p num="0084">Fig. 7 is a schematic cross-sectional view showing an
example of a process cartridge to which the developer
regulating member and developing apparatus of the present
invention are applied.</p>
    <p num="0085">A process cartridge 70 is detachably attachable to the
body of an image forming apparatus and includes a developing
apparatus 74 having a developing roller 71 as a developer 
carrying member, a developer regulating member 72 provided
so as to face to face abut the peripheral surface of the
developing roller 71, an elastic roller 73, and the like,
a photosensitive drum 75 as an image bearing member, a charging
means 76, and a cleaning means 77, and further is integrally
fabricated into a cartridge by use of developing frame members
78 and 79 made of plastic.</p>
    <p num="0086">That is, the process cartridge 70 of this embodiment
includes the aforementioned developing apparatus 74 and the
process constituent part operating on the photosensitive
drum 75 as an integral unit. Therefore, all of the
aforementioned constituent parts are similarly applied in
the process cartridge 70 and the process cartridge 70 is
provided in the image forming apparatus in a detachably
attachable manner.</p>
    <p num="0087">As described above, occurrence of fused product can
be prevented by the developer regulating member to which
the present invention is applied, so that the conventional
problem of the occurrence of an image failure of a number
of fine streaks can be prevented.</p>
    <p num="0088">Therefore, under each environment, a stable developer
thin layer can be formed so that it is possible to provide
an apparatus that can provide high quality images with stable
image density. </p>
    <p num="0089">A developer regulating member provided in a developing
apparatus according to the present invention includes a
metallic thin plate. The metallic thin plate is provided
with polyamide elastomer having a thickness of 5 to 300 µm
at an abutment portion thereof with a developing roller.
With the above structure, occurrence of a fused product is
prevented, and a stable developer thin layer is formed-Accordingly,
occurrence of a number of fine streaks on formed
images is prevented, and thus, images of high quality can
be obtained.</p>
