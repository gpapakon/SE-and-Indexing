  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The invention relates to a transmission device of variable power.
More particularly, the invention pertains to a transmission device having a
very wide range of power variation.</p>
    <p num="0002">Within the framework of wide-bandwidth wireless networks, it is
known practice to use ever higher frequencies in order to allow the
transmission of high bit rate applications such as video. These networks are
also intended to allow data exchanges between at least one base station and
a plurality of subscribers. These networks are commonly referred to as point-multipoint
networks.</p>
    <p num="0003">The point-multipoint type radio transmission systems are known to
the person skilled in the art by the acronyms MMDS (standing for Microwave
Multipoint Distribution System), LMDS (standing for Local Multipoint
Distribution System) and MVDS (standing for Multipoint Video Distribution
System). These systems used for the broadcasting of programmes permit a
return path to the subscriber terminals which allows the subscriber to interact
with the programme received. At present, the MPT-1560-RA standard
provides for the use of frequencies situated between 40.5 and 42.5 GHz.</p>
    <p num="0004">Figure 1 illustrates an LMDS type system. A broadcasting station
1 furnished with a transmission/reception antenna 2 broadcasts information
destined for a plurality of subscribers 3. Each subscriber 3 has an external
unit 4, consisting of an antenna and means for transposing the signal
received or the signal to be transmitted to an intermediate frequency, and an
internal unit 5 which comprises means of channel selection in transmission
and in reception as well as various means of coding/decoding for exchanging
data with at least one user apparatus 6, for example a television set, a
telephone or a personal computer.</p>
    <p num="0005">Transmissions in millimetre bands are strongly dependent on time
and on the distance D separating the subscriber 3 from the broadcasting
station 1. Figure 2 represents the attenuation to a 40 GHz transmission as a
function of distance. Curve 7 represents the attenuation in good weather and
curve 8 represents the attenuation during rain. As may be observed by the
person skilled in the art, the attenuation varies by around 50 dB as the
distance varies from 50 m to 2 km. </p>
    <p num="0006">Now, a base station is used for several subscribers and the
subscribers must transmit with the least power so as not to saturate the
reception of the base station and jam the other subscribers. It is therefore
necessary to have an adjustment of the transmission power at the level of
each subscriber. A dialogue between the broadcasting station and the device
placed at the subscriber's home makes it possible to tune the transmission
power.</p>
    <p num="0007">Figure 3 represents an exemplary embodiment of the transmitter
part of the device placed at the subscriber's home, according to the state of
the art. The internal unit 5 comprises means of modulation 10 which receive
a signal to be modulated. A mixer 11 is connected to the modulation means
10 so as to transpose the modulated signal into an intermediate frequency
band, a voltage-controlled oscillator 12 delivering the transposition signal.
The output of the mixer 11 is coupled to an amplification facility which
comprises one or more amplifiers 13 and a variable-gain attenuation circuit
14. A supervisory circuit 15 sends the various control signals to the
modulation means 10 to the controlled oscillator 12 and to the attenuation
circuit 14. A coaxial cable is connected at the output of the amplification
facility so as to transport the signal to the external unit 4. The external unit 4
comprises a first filter 16 connected to the coaxial cable and to a mixer 17. A
local oscillator 18 delivers a transposition frequency to the mixer. A second
filter 19 eliminates the image frequencies originating from the mixer 17. An
amplifier of SSPA type (standing for Solid State Power Amplifier) amplifies
the signal before delivering it to an antenna 21.</p>
    <p num="0008">In the circuit of Figure 3, the tuning of the transmission gain is
carried out in the internal unit 5 with the aid of the attenuation circuit 14. One
problem is that the tuning of the power with the aid of the attenuator 14 alters
the signal-to-noise ratio. It is not possible to have more than 35 dB of power
variation if one wishes to comply with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 25 dB.</p>
    <p num="0009">The invention proposes a transmission path structure which
makes it possible to increase the range of variation of the transmission
power without degrading the signal-to-noise ratio. The attenuation is carried
out in part in the internal unit and in part in the external unit by switching an
amplifier.</p>
    <p num="0010">According to a first aspect, the invention is a transmission device
comprising: an internal unit which modulates data to be transmitted and 
transposes them into an intermediate frequency band and which comprises
means of variable attenuation; an external unit which transposes at least one
intermediate band signal into a transmission frequency band, the said
external unit comprising at least one amplifier linked to an antenna; and a
linking cable which links the external unit and the internal unit. The external
unit comprises a switching circuit for short-circuiting or otherwise the
amplifier.</p>
    <p num="0011">According to a second aspect, the invention is a
transmission/reception device comprising: an internal unit which, on the one
hand, modulates data to be transmitted and transposes them into an
intermediate frequency band and which comprises means of variable
attenuation, and, on the other hand, transposes and demodulates data
received; an external unit which transposes at least one intermediate band
signal into a transmission frequency band and at least one signal received in
a reception band into the intermediate band, the said external unit
comprising at least one amplifier linked to an antenna for the transmission of
data; a linking cable which links the external unit and the internal unit. The
external unit comprises a switching circuit for short-circuiting or otherwise the
amplifier.</p>
    <p num="0012">According to a particular embodiment, the internal unit comprises
means for delivering a switching signal to the external unit and the external
unit comprises means for receiving the switching signal and controlling the
switching circuit. This embodiment permits the control of switching in the
external unit by the internal unit.</p>
    <p num="0013">Preferably, the means of variable attenuation make it possible to
have a greater range of variation of attenuation than the amplification
achieved by the short-circuitable amplifier. Thus, it is possible to switch the
external unit between two bursts without impeding transmission.</p>
    <p num="0014">The invention will be better understood, and other features and
advantages will become apparent on reading the description which follows,
the description making reference to the appended drawings among which:
<sl><li>Figure 1 represents a point-multipoint type transmission system,</li><li>Figure 2 represents curves of signal attenuation versus distance,</li><li>Figure 3 represents the circuits serving for the transmission of
data of a subscriber terminal of the system of Figure 1, according to the state
of the art, </li><li>Figures 4 and 5 represent the circuits serving for transmission of
data of a subscriber terminal of the system of Figure 1, according to two
embodiments of the invention, and</li><li>Figure 6 represents an example of integrating the transmission
circuits and reception circuits of a subscriber terminal of the system of
Figure 1, according to the invention.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0015">Figures 1 to 3 described above will not be detailed subsequently.
To improve the understanding of the person skilled in the art, the same
references are used for similar elements catering for the same function.</p>
    <p num="0016">Figure 4 represents an exemplary embodiment of the transmitter
part of the device placed at the subscriber's home, according to the
invention. The internal unit 5 comprises modulation means 10 which receive
a signal to be modulated. The signal to be modulated originates from a
device (not represented) which wishes to send data. A mixer 11 is connected
to the modulation means 10 so as to transpose the modulated signal into an
intermediate frequency band, a voltage-controlled oscillator 12 delivering the
transposition signal. The frequency delivered by the oscillator 12 is
determined by a supervisory circuit 15 as a function of the channel used in
the intermediate frequency band. The intermediate frequency band lies for
example between 0.4 and 0.7 GHz and is for example divided into channels
of 2 MHz. The output of the mixer 11 is coupled to an amplification facility
which comprises one or more amplifiers 13 and a variable-gain attenuation
circuit 14. The supervisory circuit 15 sends the various control signals to the
modulation means 10 to the controlled oscillator 12 and to the attenuation
circuit 14. The supervisory circuit is for example a microcontroller type circuit.
A coaxial cable is connected at the output of the amplification facility so as to
transport the signal to the external unit 4.</p>
    <p num="0017">The external unit 4 comprises a first filter 16 connected to the
coaxial cable and to a mixer 17. A local oscillator 18 delivers a transposition
frequency to the mixer, for example of 41.8 GHz, so as to obtain a
transmission band lying between 42.2 and 42.5 GHz. A second filter 19
eliminates the image frequencies originating from the mixer 17. An SSPA
(standing for Solid State Power Amplifier) type amplifier 20 amplifies the
signal before delivering it to an antenna 21. A switching circuit 25 is
connected between the amplifier 20 and the antenna 21 in such a way that 
as a function of a command the switching circuit effects a connection
between the antenna 21 and the output of the amplifier 20 or between the
antenna 21 and the input of the amplifier 20.</p>
    <p num="0018">The switching circuit 20 makes it possible to short-circuit or
otherwise the amplifier 20 so that it is possible to exploit or otherwise the
amplification, for example of 20 dB afforded by this amplifier. Amplifying or
otherwise the signal before transmitting it via the antenna 21 does not affect
the signal-to-noise ratio. In this first example, the switching circuit is for
example a manual switch whose position is determined as a function of the
distance between the broadcasting station 1 and the subscriber at whose
home the device is placed.</p>
    <p num="0019">The variable-gain attenuation circuit 14 makes it possible to have
a range of variation of for example 35 dB in the transmission power and the
amplifier 20 makes it possible to shift this range of variation by 20 dB. The
system has an overall range of variation of 55 dB decomposed into two subranges
of 35 dB which overlap over 15 dB. Referring to Figure 2, it may be
appreciated that the system operates very well in a fixed position with a
manual switch which is correctly positioned during installation.</p>
    <p num="0020">On the other hand if during installation the switch is poorly
positioned, a considerable climatic variation may impair proper operation.
Likewise, if the environment between the subscriber and the broadcasting
station changes appreciably, and if the subscriber is placed at a critical
distance, it is possible to have to change the positioning of the switch of the
external unit which is not necessarily accessible. Such a device becomes
unusable as soon as one wishes to use it in a mobile manner, for example in
an outside-broadcasting van.</p>
    <p num="0021">A second embodiment makes it possible to remedy all these
drawbacks by controlling the switching circuit with the aid of the supervisory
circuit of the internal unit 5. The second embodiment is represented in
Figure 5. In this Figure 5, the internal unit 5 comprises a switched oscillator
30 which delivers or otherwise a sinusoidal signal of predefined frequency,
for example 1 MHz on the coaxial cable. The oscillator being switched or
otherwise as a function of a signal originating from the supervisory circuit 15.
The presence or the absence of the sinusoidal signal indicates to the
external unit whether the amplifier 20 is or is not to be short-circuited. The
supervisory circuit 15 determines as a function of the requirement whether or
not it is necessary to short-circuit the amplifier 20. </p>
    <p num="0022">The external unit 4 is modified so as to be able to receive the
sinusoidal signal and transform it into a command for the switching circuit 25.
The switching circuit 25 is, for example, a PIN-diode switch which receives a
control signal.</p>
    <p num="0023">The external unit 4 comprises a third filter 26, of band-pass type,
centred on the frequency of 1 MHz and connected to the coaxial cable. This
filter makes it possible to isolate the sinusoidal signal which serves as
command. A rectifying circuit 27, for example a simple diode, is connected at
the output of the third filter 26. A fourth filter 28, of low-pass type, is
connected to the output of the rectifying circuit 27 so as to recover the DC
component of the rectified signal. A shaping circuit 29 is connected to the
output of the fourth filter 28. The shaping circuit 29 is, for example, a
comparator which performs the comparison of the voltage which exits the
fourth filter with a predefined threshold. The output signal from the shaping
circuit 29 is the control signal for the switching circuit 25.</p>
    <p num="0024">With such a system, the supervisory circuit 15 of the internal unit
has a range of variation of 55 dB. However, in order to preclude any
transmission problem, the switching of the amplifier 20 is carried out,
preferably, between two bursts of data.</p>
    <p num="0025">Other control possibilities can be envisaged. It is, for example,
possible to use a dedicated conductor for control but this has the effect of
being more expensive in terms of electrical wire.</p>
    <p num="0026">Other possibilities of implementation can be envisaged. By way of
example, Figure 6 represents an embodiment in which one and the same
antenna is used for transmission and reception.</p>
    <p num="0027">In addition to the elements described above, the internal unit 5
comprises separation filters 100 which are band-pass filters intended for
separating the signals sent to the external unit 4 and the signals received
from the external unit 4. The separation filters cater for the frequency
multiplexing on the coaxial cable for the internal unit. A first of the separation
filters 100 is connected between the amplifier 13 and the coaxial cable so as
to allow through the band lying between 0.4 and 0.7 GHz. A second
separation filter 100 is connected between the switched oscillator 30 and the
coaxial cable so as to allow through a narrow band centred on 1 MHz. A third
separation filter 100 is connected to the coaxial cable so as to receive and
allow through an intermediate frequency band for reception lying between
0.95 and 1.95 GHz. </p>
    <p num="0028">An amplifier 101 is connected to the third separation filter 100. A
mixer 102 carries out a transposition of the amplified signal into a baseband,
a voltage-controlled oscillator 103 delivering the transposition signal. The
frequency delivered by the oscillator 12 is determined by a supervisory circuit
15 as a function of the channel used in the intermediate frequency band for
reception. The intermediate frequency band for reception is for example
divided into channels of 33 MHz. A filter 104 connected to the output of the
mixer 102 eliminates the image frequencies. A demodulation circuit 105
transforms the signal leaving the filter 104 into a data stream.</p>
    <p num="0029">The external unit 4 comprises the elements described above for
the transmission facility and for the control of the switching circuit 25. An
extra filter 110 is added between the antenna 21 and the switching circuit 25
so as to reduce the coupling between transmission and reception. An extra
low-noise amplifier 111 can be added into the transmission facility if it is
necessary to have an amplification when the amplifier 20 is short-circuited.
The amplifier 111 may be placed at various points in the transmission facility.</p>
    <p num="0030">The external unit 4 also includes a reception facility. The reception
facility comprises a first filter 112 connected to the antenna 21. The first filter
112 is of band-pass type with strong rejection so as to allow through for
example the band lying between 40.5 and 41.5 GHz. A low-noise amplifier
113 amplifies the filtered signal. A local oscillator 114 delivers a signal at a
transposition frequency, for example equal to 40.2 GHz. A mixer 115
performs the transposition of the amplified signal with the aid of the signal
delivered by the local oscillator 114 so that the useful signal is situated in the
intermediate frequency band lying for example between 0.95 and 1.95 GHz.
A second filter 116 is placed between the output of the mixer and the coaxial
cable so as to remove the image frequencies.</p>
    <p num="0031">Numerous other possibilities of implementation are possible. In
particular, the frequencies indicated are done so purely by way of indication.
The person skilled in the art may also use other architectures for the
transmission and reception facilities, in particular architectures with common
oscillator between transmission and reception.</p>
