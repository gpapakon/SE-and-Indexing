  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a mobile radio
communication apparatus capable to a plurality of radio
communication systems.</p>
    <p num="0002">Currently, along with the tremendous
popularization of radio communication systems,
a plurality of radio communication systems with
different standards are being in use. Generally,
mobile radio communication apparatuses are prepared for
the respective mobile radio communication systems.
Recent mobile radio communication apparatuses are
required to be able to cope with not only conventional
speech communications but also various application
services such as e-mail, data communication, and Web
(world wide web) browsing. Hence, a strong demand has
arisen for a so-called single multimode terminal
apparatus which can cope with a plurality of radio
communication systems and various application services.</p>
    <p num="0003">As a technique for implementing a multimode
terminal apparatus, a SDR(Software Defined Radio) has
been proposed. The SDR realizes at least some of
signal processing operations necessary for
transmission/reception by software processing using
a programmable device such as a DSP (Digital Signal
Processor). A SDR unit can cope with various radio
communication systems or various application services
by exchanging software. For example, speech 
communication can be shifted to data communication.
Alternatively, a radio communication system can be
handed off from the W-CDMA scheme to the cdma 2000
scheme. The basic idea of such the SDR is presented
by, e.g., Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication
No. 9-331579. However, how to implement the apparatus
in consideration of various situations is not
sufficiently disclosed in this prior art.</p>
    <p num="0004">For example, for a radio communication system,
the digital information transmission rate is being
increased. Accordingly, the standard is also
frequently changed. Every time the standard is
changed, the SDR unit must be designed and developed.
A section that handles a baseband signal in the SDR
unit, i.e., a so-called modem section processes a large
amount of data. In addition, required specifications
including a processing delay are strict. For these
reasons, the design of a modem section is changed every
time the standard of a radio communication system is
changed. The above-described programmable device can
flexibly cope with such a change in design by changing
software. However, a programmable device such as a DSP
may be unable to sufficiently cope with high-speed
processing of a broadband radio communication signal.</p>
    <p num="0005">The SDR unit occupies many resources of a terminal
apparatus to cope with various radio communication
systems and application services by switching software.
To cope with a new radio communication system or to add
an application service function, a free resource must
be prepared. A resource management that optimally
distributes one resource to a radio communication
system or communication service is also required.
Especially, a mobile radio communication apparatus for
mobile communication is required to be compact and to
save power consumption. Since the resource amount is
restricted, resource management is important.
A resource means a processor such as a CPU or DSP, 
hardware such as a memory or a RAM (Random Access
Memory), the processing capability of a processor, or
the like.</p>
    <p num="0006">With a general design concept of a mobile radio
communication apparatus, resources are permanently
assigned to a plurality of signal processing
operations. When this concept is applied to the SDR
unit, the resource utilization efficiency greatly
decreases because the wireless unit must cope with a
plurality of radio communication systems or a plurality
of application services. Resource management for
a computer is mainly specialized to memory areas.
Resource management based on a hardware space or
resource management according to a wireless quality is
not taken into consideration.</p>
    <p num="0007">In the SDR unit, a software module is downloaded
through a communication channel and stored in a storage
device, as described in, e.g., Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI
Publication No. 9-331579. When software module
download is repeated to make the SDR unit to cope with
a new communication service, the amount of modules
stored in the storage device increases. The capacity
of the storage device in the SDR unit is finite.
Practically, at the time of download, unnecessary
modules must be deleted from already stored modules.
To cope with a new version of a module, updating a
module stored in the storage device must also taken
into consideration. In deleting updating a module, it
is inefficient to refer to the name or version of each
module in the storage device to determine a module to
be deleted or updated. A mechanism which efficiently
manages modules is demanded to be implemented.</p>
    <p num="0008">In various applications described above, which can
be processed by the SDR unit, generally, a list of Web
pages to be browsed by the user of the SDR unit or
a list of telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of
specific communication partners of the user is 
displayed on a menu. However, in the SDR unit capable
of coping with a plurality of radio communication
systems, generally, when an adapted radio communication
system is changed, such list files cannot be used.
Each radio communication system provides unique
application services established by a communication
service company that operates the system. This system
also provides a browser and mail system having unique
specifications.</p>
    <p num="0009">The specifications of application services change
depending on the radio communication system. Hence,
a list file of Web pages or telephone numbers and mail
addresses must be prepared for each radio communication
system. This is because an application service unique
to a radio communication system uses a file format
unique to the application service. For this reason, in
the SDR unit, a list file of Web pages or telephone
numbers and mail addresses described in a file format
corresponding to a certain radio communication system
cannot be used for another radio communication system.
When the radio communication system to be used is
changed, the user of the SDR unit must newly create
a list file for an application service of the radio
communication system. In addition, the user must
independently manage list files for a plurality of
potential radio communication systems.</p>
    <p num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to
provide a mobile radio communication apparatus which
properly and efficiently manages the resource of
a signal processing device.</p>

    <p num="0014">Referring to FIG. 1A, a mobile radio communication
apparatus according to this embodiment receives an RF
(Radio Frequency) signal from a base station (not
shown) through an antenna 1 and transmits the RF signal
to the base station through the antenna 1. A reception
signal from the antenna 1 is converted into a digital
reception IF (Intermediate Frequency) signal by a
wireless transmitter-receiver device 2 and supplied to
a signal processing device 3. A digital transmission
IF signal generated by the signal processing device 3
is converted into a transmission RF signal by the
wireless transmitter-receiver device 2 and supplied to
the antenna 1.</p>
    <p num="0015">The signal processing device 3 includes hardware
resources such as a processor, memory, and logic
circuit, which are formed into an LSI (Large-Scale
Integrated) circuit, and mainly executes processing of
a modem unit 3A and protocol unit 3B necessary for
transmission/reception, as shown in FIG. 1B.
Processing in the modem unit 3A (also called a baseband
unit) is signal processing in a region (baseband
region) close to the wireless transmitter-receiver
device 2. A specification of the modem unit 3A and
protocol 3B is defined, for example, by TS25 series of
3<sup>rd</sup> Generation Partnership Project (3GGP™) as for
W-CDMA (Wideband code-division multiple access) system
and by TS05 series of 3GGP™ as for GSM (Global system 
for mobile communication).</p>
    <p num="0016">More specifically, processing in the modem unit 3A
includes processing of demodulating a sampled digital
IF (Intermediate Frequency) signal output from the
wireless transmitter-receiver device 2 to generate
a reception baseband signal and processing of
modulating transmission data to generate a transmission
baseband signal. Processing in the protocol unit 3B
(also called an L2/L3 protocol unit) is protocol
processing determined in accordance with a radio
communication system in which the mobile radio
communication apparatus is used.</p>
    <p num="0017">The resource of the signal processing device 3 is
controlled by a resource controller 4. This control
makes it possible to immediately cope with a change in
function or specifications of the mobile radio
communication apparatus along with a change in use
condition whereby hand-over control corresponding to
movement between different radio communication systems
can easily be realized. More specifically, when the
resource controller 4 executes software change control
or logic circuit arranging method change control, or
both the control operations for the resource of the
signal processing device 3, the function of the mobile
radio communication apparatus is changed to a desired
function. As described above, when the resource
controller 4 adaptively controls the resource of the
signal processing device 3, the resource in a
restricted amount can be effectively used.</p>
    <p num="0018">Of the resource of the signal processing device 3,
a region for which software processing suffices is
realized by a general-purpose processor and memory.
A region for which a high processing speed is required
is realized by a hardware circuit such as a DSP
(Digital Signal Processor) or PLD (Programmable Logic
Device). A DSP executes desired signal processing in
accordance with a program read out from a storage 
device 5 under the control of the resource controller
4. A PLD executes desired processing by describing
a circuit arrangement in accordance with a program read
out from the storage device 5 under the control of the
resource controller 4.</p>
    <p num="0019">The storage device 5 holds software (a program and
modules as components of the program) used by the
signal processing device 3, processing data such as
reception data or transmission data, and databases such
as a telephone directory and address book. The storage
device 5 reads/writes a necessary program or data under
the control of the resource controller 4 or a system
controller 6 which controls the entire structure in the
mobile radio communication apparatus. A program read
out from the storage device 5 is described in the
signal processing device 3. As the storage device 5,
a compact hard disk drive device or a semiconductor
memory such as an FRAM (Ferroelectric Random Access
Memory) is used.</p>
    <p num="0020">An input/output unit 7 connected to the system
controller 6 includes various input/output devices
which interface to the user of the mobile radio
communication apparatus, such as a microphone for
speech input, a speaker for speech output, a keyboard,
and a display. The keyboard is used for dial
key/function key operation, text input, and editing
operation. On the display, incoming call information,
contents, menus, and the like are displayed. The
input/output unit 7 also has an MPEG interface for
moving image compression/expansion processing and a USB
interface for serial input/output to/from an external
device. These components of the input/output unit 7
are connected by an internal bus. The internal bus is
connected to the system controller 6.</p>
    <p num="0021">FIG. 2 shows a detailed arrangement of the
wireless transmitter-receiver device 2 shown in FIG. 1.
The reception system will be described. An RF 
reception signal from the antenna 1 is guided to a
low-noise amplifier 11 by a transmission/reception
changeover switch (or duplexer) 10. The RF signal
amplified to a predetermined level by the LNA 11 is
input to a mixer 13 through a BPF (bandpass filter) 12,
mixed with a first local signal LO11 for reception from
a frequency synthesizer 20, and thus down-converted.
The output signal from the mixer 13 is input to a mixer
16 through an IF amplifier 14 and bandpass filter 15,
mixed with a second local signal LO12 for reception
from the synthesizer 20, and thus down-converted to
a predetermined intermediate frequency. The output
signal from the mixer 16 is input to an A/D converter
18 through a low-pass filter 17 and converted into
a digital IF signal 19. The IF signal 19 is input to
the signal processing device 3.</p>
    <p num="0022">In the transmission system, a digital IF signal
output from the signal processing device 3 is converted
into an analog signal by a D/A converter 22.
The signal is input to a mixer 24 through a low-pass
filter 23, mixed with a first local signal LO21 for
transmission from the synthesizer 20, and thus
up-converted. The output signal from the mixer 24 is
input to a mixer 27 through a bandpass filter 25 and IF
amplifier 26, mixed with a second local signal LO22 for
transmission from the synthesizer 20, and thus
up-converted to a predetermined RF frequency. The RF
output signal from the mixer 27 is amplified by a power
amplifier 29 through a bandpass filter 28. Then, the
signal is guided to the antenna 1 through the switch 10
and radiated from the antenna 1 as a radio wave.</p>
    <p num="0023">The signal processing device 3 shown in FIG. 1
includes a general-purpose processor (CPU) 31, signal
processing unit (SPU) 32, memory 33, and input/output
interface 34, as shown in, e.g., FIG. 3A. The CPU 31
executes processing in accordance with a program given
in advance, or transmits a predetermined instruction 
and data to the SPU 32 to cause it to execute advanced
signal processing. Conversely, the CPU 31 can change
processing contents in accordance with an instruction
or trigger from the SPU 32. When the resource
controller 4 installs programs in the CPU 31 and SPU
32, the signal processing functions of the CPU 31 and
SPU 32 are defined. Furthermore, processing operations
to be distributed to the CPU 31 and SPU 32 are
determined by the resource controller 4. Referring to
FIG. 3A, the resource controller 4 is implemented by
the program that runs on the CPU 31. However, the
resource controller 4 may be implemented by a sequencer
on a DSP or logic circuit.</p>
    <p num="0024">The SPU 32 is a programmable dedicated processor
specialized to signal processing. More specifically,
at least one of a DSP and PLD is used. The SPU 32
executes signal processing using the memory 33 as a
work memory. The SPU 32 receives a signal to be
processed or outputs a processed signal from or to the
wireless transmitter-receiver device 2 and system
controller 6 through the external interface 34.
Detailed examples of contents of processing executed by
the SPU 32 are "correlation operation", "complex
operation", "maximum value detection", "memory address
conversion", "sequencer", "high-speed input/output
processing", "cumulative addition", and "function
operation".</p>
    <p num="0025">A case wherein a wireless signal processing
apparatus according to this embodiment is applied to a
CDMA (Code-Division Multiple Access) system will be
described in detail. A resource (despread circuit
resource) formed from, e.g., a plurality of logic
circuits to execute despread processing in the CDMA
system for the SPU 32 or for both the SPU 32 and CPU 31
in the signal processing device 3 is prepared. The
resource is controlled by the resource controller 4.
The CDMA system requires a function of a RAKE receiver 
which operates at a finger timing corresponding to
multipath transmission and a function of periodically
searching for a finger timing. Finger timing search is
performed in consideration of a mobile communication
environment where the multipath timing varies. These
functions are realized by a despread circuit including
a correlation circuit. Conventionally, separate
despread circuits are permanently assigned to the
functions, respectively.</p>
    <p num="0026">According to this embodiment, with resource
management by the resource controller 4, the despread
circuit resource used for RAKE reception can easily
be used for search processing at a predetermined period
or as needed in accordance with the communication
quality or the like. In this way, high-quality
communication is ensured using a smaller circuit scale.
In the CDMA receiver which receives a plurality of
code channels, the despread circuit resource is
assigned to each channel by resource management by
the resource controller 4 in accordance with
connection/disconnection of a code channel. Thus, RAKE
reception of a plurality of channels can be realized
using a finite despread circuit resource, and the
circuit scale can be made small.</p>
    <p num="0027">As shown in FIG. 3B, the SPU 32 includes, e.g.,
a plurality of DSPs 37A and 37B and a PLD 38.
These components are connected by an internal bus 39.
Both the DSPs 37A and 37B and the PLD 38 can execute
the processing of the despread circuit resource.
In this arrangement, the processing capability or MIPS
value of each of the DSPs 37A and 37B and PLD 38
corresponds to part of the resource of the signal
processing device 3. In the example of the CDMA
system, when it is assumed that the processing
capability of one despread circuit is 10 [MIPS], a DSP
having a processing capability of 100 [MIPS] can be
handled as a despread resource equivalent to 10 
despread circuits.</p>
    <p num="0028">To realize the functions (e.g., RAKE reception,
multipath search, neighboring cell search, and
multi-channel reception) of the mobile radio
communication apparatus applied to the CDMA system, the
resource controller 4 assigns the total resource of the
signal processing device 3 such that the resources of
the DSPs 37A and 37B are assigned to all functions
required at that time. For example, when a resource
corresponding to 15 despread circuits in total is
required, the resource controller 4 causes the PLD 38
to bear a processing capability of 100 [MIPS]
equivalent to the capability of 10 despread circuits
and causes the DSP 37A or 37B to bear a processing
capability of 50 [MIPS] equivalent to the capability of
the remaining five despread circuits.</p>
    <p num="0029">As described above, in the mobile radio
communication apparatus according to this embodiment,
a function can be reconstructed with a high degree of
freedom. For this reason, the cost and development
period necessary for addition of a function can be
reduced. The resource distribution of the signal
processing device 3 is not limited to use in a single
radio communication system. For example, a CDMA system
and TDMA (Time-Division Multiple Access) system, a TDMA
system and FDMA (Frequency-Division Multiple Access)
system, or an FDMA system and CDMA system have common
processing elements. The resource distribution of the
signal processing device 3 can be executed in
accordance with the same procedure as described above
for processing that is common and does not conflict in
time between such different radio communication
systems.</p>
    <p num="0030">The signal function of the modem unit 3A shown in
FIG. 1B, which is included in the signal processing
device 3, can be freely reconstructed. This is useful
when the mobile radio communication apparatus is used 
while moving between the service areas of different
radio communication systems. That is, the mobile radio
communication apparatus can optimally select a usable
radio communication system in accordance with the radio
wave reception state or the degree of radio channel
congestion at the movement destination and execute
communication under the selected system. With this
arrangement, roaming or hand-over is facilitated.</p>
    <p num="0031">As shown in FIG. 4, the general-purpose processor
(CPU) 31 functions as a program sequencer (PS) 41 which
manages program execution and an arithmetic and logic
unit (ALU) 42. The signal processing unit (SPU) 32
shown in FIG. 3A executes signal processing in
accordance with the start or end of self-processing or
a programmed sequence and supplies a trigger signal or
interrupt signal to the CPU 31. The trigger signal or
interrupt signal supplied to the CPU 31 is detected by
the PS 41. The CPU 31 can recognize the state of the
SPU 32, e.g., "end of signal processing" and change the
contents of processing of the ALU 42 on the basis of
the recognition result. As described above, when the
CPU 31 and SPU 32 are made to cooperate and selectively
execute processing, complex arithmetic operation can be
executed at a high speed.</p>
    <p num="0032">As shown in FIG. 5, the SPU 32 has an arithmetic
and logic unit (ALU) 51, instruction memory 52,
data memory 53, and input/output interface 54.
The ALU 51 executes advanced signal processing such as
"correlation operation", "complex operation", "array
conversion", "maximum value detection", "memory address
conversion", "sequencer", and "high-speed input/output"
in accordance with input data from an external device,
data in the memory 33, and a processing instruction or
data from the CPU 31. A processing result from the ALU
51 is written in the data memory 53, a memory or
register in the CPU 31, memory 33, or input/output
interface 34. Advanced signal processing that is heavy 
for the CPU 31 is executed by the SPU 32 serving as a
dedicated processor. This reduces the load on the CPU
31 and increases the processing speed.</p>
    <p num="0033">FIG. 6 shows an address conversion circuit for the
SPU 32. The address conversion circuit is formed from
two address decoders 61 and 62 in a memory 60.
Predetermined conversion patterns are written in the
address decoders 61 and 62, respectively. One of the
address decoders 61 and 62 is selected in accordance
with an instruction from the SPU 32, and the decoding
contents are switched. A register group 63 in the
memory 60 comprises memory cells in the memory such as
a RAM (Random Access Memory). The decoding contents of
a write address decoder prepared in a normal RAM and
those of a read address decoder are identical. Hence,
to realize, by a normal RAM, bit array conversion
processing such as bit interleaving included in
processing by the SPU 32, an address must be calculated
for every read.</p>
    <p num="0034">According to FIG. 6, when the address decoders 61
and 62 are used as a write address decoder and read
address decoder, respectively, such address calculation
can be omitted. For this reason, conversion processing
such as interleaving whose processing amount is
enormous can be executed at a high speed. The address
decoders 61 and 62 may be formed from devices such as
rewritable RAMs, and an address conversion table may be
written in each device. Since this arrangement can
cope with a plurality of conversion patterns, flexible
processing coping with various patterns can be realized
by a simple arrangement.</p>
    <p num="0035">As shown in FIG. 3A, data transmission/reception
between the CPU 31 and the SPU 32 can also be directly
executed through a register array 36 in the CPU 31.
The register array 36 is directly accessed from the
SPU 32. That is, the SPU 32 can directly write
a self-data output in the register array 36 or directly 
read out data from the register array 36. The CPU 31
can receive contents of the register array 36 or write
data in the register array 36. When the register array
36 is used for data transmission/reception between the
CPU 31 and the SPU 32, the CPU 31 only need to access
the register array 36 independently of the operation
state of the SPU 32 in transmitting/receiving data.
Hence, data transfer processing in the CPU 31 can be
executed at a high speed, and processing of the signal
processing device 3 can be executed at a high speed.</p>
    <p num="0036">Operation performed when the signal processing
device 3 shown in FIG. 3 receives, by the input/output
interface 34, a digitized reception IF signal from the
wireless transmitter-receiver device 2 and processes
the signal will be described. When a reception signal
is to be processed by only the CPU, most of the
arithmetic capability of the CPU is consumed by only
the input/output processing. Only the remaining
capability of the CPU can be assigned to other
processing. According to the signal processing device
3 shown in FIG. 3A, when input/output processing is
executed by the SPU 32 without using the CPU 31, the
processing capability of the CPU 31 can be assigned to
processing other than the input/output processing.</p>
    <p num="0037">The reception IF signal received by the
input/output interface 34 is sequentially received by
the SPU 32. If fixed processing is necessary, the
SPU 32 executes predetermined signal processing.
The processing result from the SPU 32 is written in
the register array 36. The CPU 31 executes necessary
processing using data written in the memory 33 or
register array 36. As described above, when
input/output processing and signal processing are
assigned to the SPU 32, the load on the CPU 31 can be
reduced. In other words, the processing load on the
signal processing device 3 is distributed to the CPU 31
and SPU 32, thereby realizing high-speed signal 
processing in the entire signal processing device 3.
To further distribute the load, a plurality of CPUs may
be prepared, and processing to be executed by the
CPU 31 shown in FIG. 3A may be distributed to the CPUs.</p>
    <p num="0038">Other embodiments of the present invention will be
described below. In the following embodiments, the
basic arrangement of a mobile radio communication
apparatus is the same as in the first embodiment.
Variations of components or operation form of the

    <p num="0039">A signal processing device 3 shown in FIG. 7 has
a circuit arrangement description memory 71, program
sequencer 72, programmable hardware device 73, and
memory 74. The programmable hardware device 73 is
hardware capable of redefining a circuit arrangement
such as a PLD or FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).
The programmable hardware device 73 is a set of various
logic circuits which perform basic arithmetic operation
of signal processing. The programmable hardware device
73 may be a device which can programmably change the
combination of various logic circuits by a switch to
realize a predetermined processing function.</p>
    <p num="0040">In a general processor such as a CPU or DSP, the
circuit arrangement of an internal ALU portion is
fixed. To realize processing contents by an
instruction set given to a processor, a dedicated
circuit corresponding to each instruction set is formed
as an ALU. In this embodiment, however, processing
that is normally executed by an ALU is realized by the
programmable hardware device 73 capable of redefining
the circuit arrangement.</p>
    <p num="0041">The circuit arrangement description memory 71
stores, as programs, circuit arrangement descriptions
necessary for the programmable hardware device 73 to
realize desired processing. More specifically, the
circuit arrangement description memory 71 stores not 
only circuit arrangement descriptions necessary for
hardware to realize basic processing such as "four
arithmetical operations", "data transfer", or "bit
shift", which is included in a normal ALU, but also
circuit arrangement descriptions necessary for
hardware to realize processing such as "correlation
arithmetic operation", "complex multiplication
processing", "maximum value detection processing", or
"absolute value arithmetic operation", which is
executed by a normal processor in a plurality of steps,
and a circuit arrangement description that indicates a
combination of basic arithmetic processing operations.
Every time a new signal processing function of the
signal processing device 3 is added, the circuit
arrangement description of the programmable hardware
device 73 is changed to realize the signal processing
function using the circuit arrangement description
memory 71.</p>
    <p num="0042">A number of programs used to execute such a
circuit arrangement description on the memory 71 are
stored in a program area 74A of the memory 74. A
necessary program is read out from the block area 74A
and supplied to the circuit arrangement description
memory 71 under the control of the program sequencer
72. With this operation, the circuit arrangement of
the programmable hardware device 73 is redefined.</p>
    <p num="0043">According to this embodiment, processing of the
signal processing device 3 is realized by the
programmable hardware device 73 capable of redefining
the circuit arrangement. Hence, processing, which is
executed by a normal processor for executing software
processing in several ten to several hundred steps, can
be executed in several cycles at a high speed. In
addition, the mobile radio communication apparatus can
flexibly cope with definition of various signal
processing functions. </p>
    <heading>(Third Embodiment)</heading>
    <p num="0044">In a signal processing device 3 shown in FIG. 8, a
CPU 75 is added to the arrangement shown in FIG. 7. A
circuit arrangement description memory 71, program
sequencer 72, programmable hardware device 73, and
memory 74 are the same as those described with
reference to FIG. 7. In this case, the program
sequencer 72 also has a function of selecting a device
in correspondence with processing contents to cause the
programmable hardware device 73 to execute
predetermined complex signal processing and to cause
the CPU 75 to execute normal signal processing and a
function of simultaneously operating the programmable
hardware device 73 and CPU 75 to execute parallel
processing.</p>
    <p num="0045">Especially, in signal processing in a modem unit
3A shown in FIG. 1B, the program sequencer 72 executes
a resource management program from a resource
controller 4 whereby processing operations to be
distributed to the programmable hardware device 73 and
CPU 75 are determined in accordance with a signal
processing function that the signal processing device 3
should have. In accordance with this determination, a
circuit arrangement description selected from the
circuit arrangement description memory 71 is supplied
to the programmable hardware device 73.
Simultaneously, an execution designation about
processing to be distributed to the CPU 75 is supplied
from the program sequencer 72 to the CPU 75.</p>
    <p num="0046">Under the above control by the program sequencer
72, signal processing that is complex and heavy for the
CPU 75 is executed by the programmable hardware device
73 serving as a processor dedicated to signal
processing. The remaining processing operations are
executed by the CPU 75. Hence, high-speed processing
becomes possible. In addition, the mobile radio
communication apparatus can easily cope with a signal 
processing function to be held by the signal processing
device 3 or a change in design. Furthermore, the time
required for development of a new mobile radio
communication apparatus can be shortened.</p>
    <heading>(Fourth Embodiment)</heading>
    <p num="0047">A signal processing device 3 shown in FIG. 9 is
different from the arrangement shown in FIG. 7 in that
the device has two programmable hardware devices 73A
and 73B. A program sequencer 72 has an additional
function of executing control to distribute processing
operations to the programmable hardware devices 73A and
73B. With this arrangement, the processing function of
the signal processing device 3 can be changed with a
higher degree of freedom. In addition, more complex
signal processing can be executed. The arrangement of
this embodiment may be extended to prepare three or
more programmable hardware devices.</p>
    <p num="0048">FIG. 10 shows details of the signal processing
device 3 shown in FIG. 9. A program memory 80 and data
memory 81 corresponds to program areas 74A and 74B in
a memory 74. A control circuit 92 corresponds to
the program sequencer 72. A circuit arrangement
description memory 83 corresponds to a circuit
arrangement description memory 71. An SPU 84
corresponds to a programmable hardware device 73.
An instruction or data from an external device, i.e.,
a resource controller 4 or system controller 6 in
FIG. 1A is received by the signal processing device 3
through an input register group 85, transferred to and
temporarily held by a register group 86, supplied to
an output register group 87, and transferred to the
SPU 84.</p>
    <p num="0049">Assume that, e.g., the following processing

    <p num="0050">These processing programs (i), (ii), and (iii)
represent addition, multiplication, and complex
multiplication, respectively. X and Y of (X,Y)
represent the elements of the real and imaginary parts
of a complex number, respectively. * represents a
complex multiplication.</p>
    <p num="0051">A circuit arrangement description to realize each
arithmetic operation is recorded in the circuit
arrangement description memory 83. A control circuit
82 accesses the circuit arrangement description memory
83 in accordance with the contents of the programs
stored in the program memory 80, thereby rewriting the
circuit arrangement description of the SPU 84 serving
as a programmable hardware device. In the
above-described examples of processing programs, an
addition circuit, multiplication circuit, and complex
multiplication circuit are formed in the SPU 84.
Signal processing to be executed by the SPU 84 is
not limited to addition/subtraction/multiplication.
Any other processing such as correlation arithmetic
operation or maximum/minimum value determination can be
executed if it can be described by a circuit
arrangement. As processing becomes complex, the
processing efficiency is improved by changing the
hardware configuration dedicated to the processing.
Hence, the processing speed can be further increased.</p>
    <heading>(Fifth Embodiment)</heading>
    <p num="0052">As shown in FIG. 11, a signal processing device 3
according to the fifth embodiment of the present
invention has, as a hardware resource, an area 3A where
signal processing function redefinition is impossible,
an area 3B where it is possible, and a switch unit (SW)
110. Logic circuits that are frequently used, such as
CRC attach blocks 101, CRC check blocks 102, Viterbi
decoder 103, turbo decoder 104, correlator 105,
accumulator 106, demodulators 107, and de-interleaver
108 are mounted in the unredefinable area 3A. 
The redefinable area 3B is formed from a plurality of
PLDs 109, i.e., components of an FPGA. The switch unit
110 switches connection between the areas 3A and 3B and
connection between the respective blocks in the area 3B
under the control of a resource controller 4.</p>
    <p num="0053">FIGS. 12 and 13 show connection states
corresponding to a single radio communication system,
which are realized by switching the switch unit 110 of
the signal processing device 3 shown in FIG. 11.
A reception signal input to the signal processing
device 3 is input to the correlator 105 and demodulator
107. The output signal from the correlator 105 is
input to the accumulator 106. The output signal from
the accumulator 106 is input to the demodulator 107.
The output signal from the demodulator 107 becomes the
output signal from the signal processing device 3
through the de-interleaver 108, Viterbi decoder 103,
and CRC check block 102. In FIG. 13, an equalizer 111
whose function is assigned to the PLD 109 is added to
the arrangement shown in FIG. 12. The input signal is
input to the demodulator 107 through the equalizer 111.</p>
    <p num="0054">FIG. 14 shows a connection example in the signal
processing device 3, which can cope with two
radio communication systems A and B. The demodulators
107 are shared by both the systems A and B. In either
the system A or B, the output signal from the
demodulator 107 is input to the de-interleaver 108.
The output signal from the de-interleaver 108 is input
to the Viterbi decoder 103 in the system A or to the
turbo decoder 104 in the system B. The output signal
from the Viterbi decoder 103 or turbo decoder 104
becomes the output signal from the signal processing
device 3 through the CRC check block 102.</p>
    <p num="0055">The resource size of the signal processing device
3 and, more particularly, the size of the areas 3A and
3B changes depending on the mobile radio communication
apparatus. In a mobile radio communication apparatus 
having some application service functions installed,
many signal processing functions are already defined
in the resource of the signal processing device 3.
The residual resource amount of the signal processing
device 3 changes every moment in accordance with the
use situation of the mobile radio communication
apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0056">The resource controller 4 has a resource
administration table 130, a resource manager 131,
an update system 132 that updates the resource of
the signal processing device 3, a buffer 133 that
temporarily stores various data, and a resource monitor
system 134 that monitors the use situation of the
resource of the signal processing device 3, as shown in
FIG. 15.</p>
    <p num="0057">The resource manager 131 updates the resource
administration table 130 serving as a resource use
situation list on the basis of a monitor result from
the resource monitor system 134. The resource manager
131 grasps the residual resource amount in the
redefinable area 3B of the signal processing device 3
by looking up the resource administration table 130 or
on the basis of the monitor result from the resource
monitor system 134. The resource manager 131 grasps
a resource amount required in the redefinable area 3B
to define a new signal processing function that should
be additionally defined to the resource of the signal
processing device 3, on the basis of arrangement
description information for realizing the function.
In the resource manager 131, a new signal processing
function is additionally defined in the redefinable
area 3B for the resource of the signal processing
device 3 using the resource update device 132 in
accordance with the required resource amount and
residual resource amount.</p>
    <p num="0058">According to this embodiment, even in an
environment wherein the resource of the signal 
processing device 3 of each mobile radio communication
apparatus is different from the resource use situation,
a new signal processing function can be efficiently
added in accordance with the resource use situation
that changes every moment. That is, optimum resource
distribution can be done by adding a new signal
processing function using information of the situation
of resource already used by the mobile radio
communication apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0059">FIG. 16 shows the arrangement of a radio
communication system including a mobile radio
communication apparatus 10 according to this embodiment
as a terminal. In this radio communication system,
an arrangement description information providing
apparatus 140 is present in a base station. The
arrangement description information providing apparatus
140 provides to the mobile radio communication
apparatus 10 information (to be referred to as
arrangement description information hereinafter) that
describes the arrangement of a signal processing
function to be additionally defined to the resource of
the signal processing device 3 in the mobile radio
communication apparatus 10.</p>
    <p num="0060">To provide arrangement description information to
the mobile radio communication apparatus 10 by radio
communication in this example, the arrangement
description information providing apparatus 140 has
an antenna 141, a wireless transmission/reception
device 142, and a buffer 143 for storing arrangement
description information. Communication between the
mobile radio communication apparatus 10 and the
arrangement description information providing apparatus
140 may be wired communication. For example, a service
center which updates the function of the mobile radio
communication apparatus 10 uses the arrangement
description information providing apparatus 140 as
an apparatus for updating the function. </p>
    <p num="0061">The mobile radio communication apparatus 10 has
an antenna 1, wireless transmitter-receiver device 2,
signal processing device 3, resource controller 4,
storage device 5, system controller 6, and input/output
unit 7, as shown in FIG. 1A. The resource controller 4
has the resource administration table 130, resource
manager 131, resource update system 132, buffer 133,
and resource monitor system 134 for monitoring the use
situation of the resource of the signal processing
device 3, as shown in FIG. 15.</p>
    <p num="0062">In the arrangement description information
providing apparatus 140, arrangement description
information corresponding to a signal processing
function to be newly added to the radio communication
apparatus 10 is read out from the buffer 143.
The readout arrangement description information is
transmitted to the mobile radio communication apparatus
10 by the wireless transmission/reception device 142.
The arrangement description information transmitted
to the mobile radio communication apparatus 10 is
received by the wireless transmitter-receiver device 2.
On the basis of the received arrangement description
information, the resource controller 4 grasps the
resource amount necessary for the signal processing
device 3 to realize the desired signal processing
function. On the basis of the resource use situation
monitored by the resource monitor system 134, the
resource controller 4 grasps the residual resource
amount that is not used in the signal processing
device 3. The resource controller 4 optimally
distributes the resource to the signal processing
function to be additionally defined to the resource of
the signal processing device 3 in accordance with the
required resource amount and residual resource amount.</p>
    <p num="0063">FIG. 17 shows another arrangement of the radio
communication system including the mobile radio
communication apparatus 10 according to this 
embodiment. The arrangement description information
providing apparatus 140 has a resource controller 144
in addition to the antenna 141, wireless
transmission/reception device 142, and buffer 143
described with reference to FIG. 16. To additionally
define a new signal processing function to the resource
of the signal processing device 3 in the mobile radio
communication apparatus 10, information representing
the use situation of the resource of the signal
processing device 3, which is monitored by the resource
monitor system 134, is transmitted to the arrangement
description information providing apparatus 140 through
the antenna 1 by the wireless transmitter-receiver
device 2.</p>
    <p num="0064">In the arrangement description information
providing apparatus 140, arrangement description
information representing the signal processing function
to be newly additionally defined in the signal
processing device 3 is read out from the buffer 143.
On the basis of the arrangement description
information, the resource controller 144 grasps the
resource amount necessary to additionally define the
new signal processing function to the resource of the
signal processing device 3. In addition, on the basis
of the resource use situation monitored by the resource
monitor system 134, the resource controller 144 grasps
the residual resource amount of the signal processing
device 3. The resource controller 144 obtains, by
arithmetic operation, optimum resource distribution for
the signal processing function to be additionally
defined to the resource of the signal processing
device 3, and outputs resource distribution designation
information. The resource distribution designation
information is transmitted to the mobile radio
communication apparatus 10 through the antenna 141 by
the wireless transmission/reception device 142.</p>
    <p num="0065">The resource distribution information transmitted 
to the mobile radio communication apparatus 10 is
received by the wireless transmitter-receiver device 2
through the antenna 1 and transferred to the resource
controller 4. The resource controller 4 optimally
distributes the resource to the signal processing
function to be additionally defined to the resource of
the signal processing device 3 in accordance with the
resource distribution information. As described above,
arithmetic operation for resource distribution is
executed in the arrangement description information
providing apparatus 140. That is, arithmetic operation
necessary to add a new signal processing function to
the resource of the signal processing device 3 in the
mobile radio communication apparatus 10 is executed
outside the mobile radio communication apparatus 10.
Since the amount of arithmetic operation executed by
the resource controller 4 in the mobile radio
communication apparatus 10 decreases, the mobile radio
communication apparatus 10 can be made inexpensive.
That is, since processing required for resource
distribution of the signal processing device 3 in
the terminal is assisted by the base station, the
processing load on the terminal, which is required for
resource distribution, can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="0066">The operation of this embodiment will be described
with reference to FIGS. 18 to 20. Referring to
FIG. 18, first, the mobile radio communication
apparatus 10 receives arrangement description
information transmitted from the arrangement
description information providing apparatus 140 (step
S101). In the mobile radio communication apparatus 10,
the resource controller 4 obtains the resource amount
required to additionally define a signal processing
function to the signal processing device 3 using
the received arrangement description information
(step S102). The necessary resource amount is compared
with the resource amount (initial resource amount) of 
the signal processing device 3 at the time of delivery
of the mobile radio communication apparatus 10
(step S103). If the necessary resource amount is
larger than the initial resource amount, the
arrangement description information providing apparatus
140 is notified that the signal processing function
cannot be additionally defined (step S104).</p>
    <p num="0067">When the necessary resource amount is smaller than
the initial resource amount, the resource controller 4
grasps the current resource use situation, e.g., the
residual resource amount of the signal processing
device 3 by the resource monitor system 134 (step
S105). The residual resource amount is compared with
the necessary resource amount to determine whether a
new signal processing function can be additionally
defined in the signal processing device 3 (step S106).
If YES in step S106, the new signal processing function
is defined to the resource of the signal processing
device 3 by the resource update system 132 (step S107).
In step S107, resource assignment of a signal
processing function already defined in the signal
processing device 3 is changed as needed. If NO in
step S106, the arrangement description information
providing apparatus 140 is notified of it (step S140).
Processing in step S103 may be omitted.</p>
    <p num="0068">Referring to FIG. 19, processing in steps S201 to
S204 is the same as that in steps S101 to S104 of
FIG. 18. In step S205, the current resource use
situation, e.g., the residual resource amount of
the signal processing device 3 is grasped by looking up
the resource administration table 130. In step S206,
it is determined whether a new signal processing
function can be additionally defined in the signal
processing device 3. If YES in step S206, the new
signal processing function is defined to the resource
of the signal processing device 3 by the resource
update system 132 (step S207). Accordingly, 
the resource administration table 130 is updated
(step S208).</p>
    <p num="0069">Referring to FIG. 20, processing in steps S301 to
S305 and processing in steps S307 and S308 are the same
as that in steps S201 to S204 and that in steps S206
and S207 of FIG. 19. In FIG. 20, after processing in
step S305 and before a new signal processing function
is additionally defined to the resource of the signal
processing device 3 in step S307, the resource
administration table 130 is updated in step S306.</p>
    <p num="0070">As described above, the resource size of the
signal processing device 3 generally changes depending
on each mobile radio communication apparatus.
Accordingly, the structure and size of the
unredefinable area 3A and redefinable area 3B shown in
FIG. 11 also change depending on each mobile radio
communication apparatus. Hence, to efficiently
distribute the resource to the signal processing
function of the signal processing device 3, details of
the resource of the signal processing device 3, e.g.,
the numbers of the CRC attach blocks 101 and CRC check
blocks 102 in FIG. 11 and the like must be grasped.</p>
    <p num="0071">In the radio communication system shown in
FIG. 17, the resource controller 144 is arranged in the
arrangement description information providing apparatus
140, i.e., an apparatus other than the mobile radio
communication apparatus 10 having the signal processing
device 3. If the resource controller 144 is to execute
arithmetic operation necessary to additionally define a
new signal processing function to the resource of the
signal processing device 3, the resource controller 144
must be able to grasp details of the resource of the
signal processing device 3.</p>
    <p num="0072">Using, as an example, the radio communication
system shown in FIG. 17 in which the arrangement
description information providing apparatus 140 is
arranged on the base station and the mobile radio 
communication apparatus 10 serves as a terminal, a
method of grasping at the base station details of the
resource (to be referred to as a terminal resource
hereinafter) of the signal processing device 3 in the
mobile radio communication apparatus 10 will be
described.</p>
    <p num="0073">As shown in FIG. 21, a layer structure (L1/L2:
layer 1/layer 2) in a conventional base station has
a data link control (DLC) and physical layer (PHY).
The DLC has a media access control (MAC), error control
block (EC), and radio resource controller (RRC).
At the base station, the error control block (EC)
receives data sent from an upper layer and executes
signal processing to impart resilience against any
error generated in the wireless transmitter-receiver
device. The signal output from the error control block
(EC) is sent to the media access control (MAC).
The signal output from the MAC is sent to the physical
layer (PHY). In the PHY, signal processing for
modulation is executed to generate an RF signal to be
used for wireless transmission. The EC, MAC, and PHY
are controlled by the radio resource controller (RRC).
Conversely, when the base station is to receive
a transmission signal from a terminal, processing is
executed in an order reverse to the above-described
signal flow.</p>
    <p num="0074">FIG. 22 shows a layer structure in the base
station of the radio communication system according to
this embodiment. Referring to FIG. 22, a controller
that controls a terminal resource is newly added to the
L1/L2 structure shown in FIG. 21. More specifically, a
TRC (Terminal Resource Control) is added as a component
of the DLC (Data Link Control). The TRC independently
communicates with the RRC (Radio Resource Control) to
acquire the machine number or model information of the
terminal. That is, the TRC acquires the machine number
or model information of the terminal by monitoring 
communication between the terminal and the base
station.</p>
    <p num="0075">As a method of grasping the resource of the
terminal from the machine number or model information,
a table is used. FIG. 23 shows an example of such
a table. In this table, a resource list indicating
details of the terminal resource is referred to.
In the resource list, functional block names and the
quantities of the blocks are described, as shown in
FIG. 24. In addition, remarks representing that, e.g.,
simultaneous use is impossible are described.
As described above, the resource is divided into the
unredefinable area 3A and redefinable area 3B.</p>
    <p num="0076">The TRC grasps the resource amount necessary to
define a desired signal processing function to the
terminal resource using the information of the source
list as shown in FIG. 24, obtains optimum resource
distribution by arithmetic operation, and outputs
resource distribution designation information.
The resource distribution designation information is
transmitted from the base station to the terminal.
The table shown in FIG. 23 is updated every time a new
terminal is released.</p>
    <p num="0077">FIG. 25 shows the layer structures of the base
station (BS) and terminal (MT) according to this
embodiment. The base station BS has the TRC, and the
terminal MT has a resource controller (RC). The TRC
has the resource list of each terminal. The terminal
resource changes depending on the terminal. The RC has
a resource administration table that indicates the use
situation of each terminal resource. The ratio of the
unredefinable area to the redefinable area of the
terminal resource changes depending on the terminal.
The terminal resource use situation is monitored by the
resource monitor system.</p>
    <p num="0078">The TRC arranged in the base station BS
communicates with the RC arranged in the terminal MT to 
acquire information of use situation of the terminal
resource from the terminal. To grasp the use situation
of the terminal resource, the TRC transmits, e.g.,
a message as shown in FIG. 26 to the RRC. Upon
receiving this message, the RRC in the base station BS
requests the RC arranged in the terminal MT to declare
the use situation of the terminal resource to the base
station. Upon receiving this request, the RC in the
terminal MT updates the terminal resource use situation
table and transmits the table to the base station BS.
The TRC in the base station BS has the resource list of
the terminal MT. The TRC grasps the type and quantity
of the resource of the terminal MT by the list. Hence,
the resource use situation table sent from the terminal
MT to the base station BS is simplified to a table
that describes only numerical values in accordance with
a predetermined order, as shown in FIG. 27. Upon
receiving the resource use situation table, the RRC
transmits a message shown in FIG. 28 to the TRC
arranged in the base station.</p>
    <p num="0079">With the above procedure, the TRC can grasp the
use situation of the terminal resource. The resource
of the terminal is grasped on the basis of information
such as a machine number or terminal model, and the
terminal resource use situation is acquired from the
terminal. On the basis of these pieces of information,
the TRC obtains, by arithmetic operation, optimum
resource distribution necessary for a function to be
newly added, and outputs resource distribution
designation information. This resource distribution
designation information is transmitted from the base
station to the terminal.</p>
    <p num="0080">In a terminal capable of changing signal
processing functions, the resource use amount gradually
changes. That is, some of functions set in the
terminal once may become unnecessary. Hence, when the
resource administration table is updated at the time of 
adding a function, resource management based on latest
information can be done.</p>
    <p num="0081">To send a notification representing that addition
of a signal processing function is impossible to the
terminal, in, e.g., the radio communication system
shown in FIG. 16, a mechanism for transmitting a
notification representing that additional definition of
a function is impossible from the mobile radio
communication apparatus 10 to the arrangement
description information providing apparatus 140 is
added. In additionally defining signal processing
functions, the resource amount may be too small to
additionally define all the signal processing
functions. In this case, the base station can grasp
that additional definition of a new signal processing
function is impossible on the terminal side. Upon
grasping this information, the base station transmits
arrangement description information to additionally
define minimum signal processing functions
corresponding to the residual resource amount on the
terminal side. When minimum signal processing
functions are additionally defined, the service as the
radio communication system can improve.</p>

    <p num="0082">FIG. 29 shows a mobile radio communication
apparatus according to the sixth embodiment of the
present invention. Like the above embodiments, this
mobile radio communication apparatus has an antenna 1,
wireless transmitter-receiver device 2, signal
processing device 3, resource controller 4, and storage
device 5. A system controller 6 and input/output
unit 7 shown in FIG. 1A are not illustrated in FIG. 29.</p>
    <p num="0083">The signal processing device 3 is formed from
a processor such as a CPU or DSP that executes signal
processing by software or a programmable hardware
device such as a PLD. A case wherein the signal
processing device 3 is formed from a processor will be 
exemplified. The processor has a storage area such as
a RAM area where an execution program is loaded.
The processor executes signal processing by loading
a module group that forms a program for signal
processing in the storage area. A module here means
a compiled execution format file. Each signal
processing function is formed as software or a module.</p>
    <p num="0084">The storage device 5 stores a program and data
files. Especially, as a program, a module group with
specifications assumed in the signal processing
device 3 is stored. With this arrangement, a module
group necessary for the mobile radio communication
apparatus to shift to another mode, e.g., a mode for
receiving another channel can be read out from the
storage device 5 and transferred to the signal
processing device 3.</p>
    <p num="0085">FIG. 30 shows examples of the contents in the
storage area of the signal processing device 3 and in
the'storage device 5. The signal processing device 3
has a DSP 210 as a processor. A speech transmitter
module 211 and speech receiver module 212 are loaded in
the storage area. The storage device 5 stores a data
transmitter module 221, equalizer module 222, Viterbi
decoder module 223, and CRC module 224.</p>
    <p num="0086">The resource controller 4 has a resource
administration table 200, resource manager 201,
resource rewrite processor 202, and download buffer
203. Information of the storage position of a module
executable in the signal processing device 3 is stored
in the resource administration table 200. The resource
manager 201 controls (a) the order of exchanging
modules in resource, (b) determination whether the
modules are to be exchanged, and (c) timing of
exchange. The resource rewrite processor 202 rewrites
the module in the processor of the signal processing
device 3, in accordance with a designation from the
resource manager 201. The download buffer 203 
temporarily stores an externally downloaded module.</p>
    <p num="0087">The basic operation of the mobile radio
communication apparatus according to this embodiment is
the same as in the above-described embodiments.
Operation unique to this embodiment will be described
below. Assume that the wireless transmission path
between the mobile radio communication apparatus and
a base station (not shown) degrades due to shadowing,
i.e., putting the mobile radio communication apparatus
in a shadow, and a desired communication quality cannot
be obtained. The communication quality is detected by,
e.g., a field measuring function of the wireless
transmitter-receiver device 2.</p>
    <p num="0088">If the desired communication quality is not
obtained, the resource controller 4 determines that an
equalizer module need be newly added to the resource of
the signal processing device 3 to improve the
communication quality. In the resource controller 4,
The resource manager 201 executes control to add an
equalizer module to the resource on the basis of the
determination if the signal processing device 3 has
a sufficient residual resource amount. The resource
manager 201 recognizes whether an equalizer module is
present in the storage device 5 by looking up the
resource administration table 200. When the equalizer
module 222 is present in the storage device 5, as shown
in FIG. 30, the resource controller 4 loads the
equalizer in the signal processing device 3 as the
execution file of the processor serving as the signal
processing device 3. If no equalizer module is present
in the storage device 5, the resource controller 4
issues a download request to acquire the module and
stores it in the download buffer 203.</p>
    <p num="0089">When the module necessary for the signal
processing device 3 in the mobile radio communication
apparatus is not stored in the storage device 5, the
download request is output to, e.g., a base station 
which has, as a service area, an area where the mobile
radio communication apparatus is currently located.
The base station transfers the received download
request to a network (not shown). The network
transmits, through the base station, the requested
module to the mobile radio communication apparatus that
has issued the download request.</p>
    <p num="0090">In this way, when the program held in the storage
area of the processor serving as the signal processing
device 3 is exchanged, a necessary signal processing
function is defined in the signal processing device 3.
As a program, a necessary module is fetched, as needed.
With this arrangement, any wasteful use of resource by
a normally unnecessary module resident in the storage
area of the processor, i.e., unnecessary occupation of
the memory resource can be suppressed. Hence, the
mobile radio communication apparatus can cope with
roaming or hand-off between different radio
communication systems while effectively using the
resource with a finite capacity.</p>
    <p num="0091">A more detailed example of operation of the mobile
radio communication apparatus according to this
embodiment will be described next. First, a case
wherein the type of communication is switched, e.g.,
a state wherein the mobile radio communication
apparatus is used for speech communication is changed
to a state wherein the mobile radio communication
apparatus is used for data communication such as Web
browsing will be described.</p>
    <p num="0092">When the type of communication is to be switched
from, e.g., speech communication to data communication,
a module for speech communication, e.g., speech CODEC
module becomes unnecessary. Instead, a module with
TCP/IP newly becomes necessary. The resource manager
201 checks whether a TCP/IP module is present in the
storage device 5 by looking up the resource
administration table 200. If a TCP/IP module is 
present in the storage device 5, the module is loaded
to the storage area of the processor as an execution
file of the processor serving as the signal processing
device 3. The unnecessary speech communication module
such as a speech CODEC module is cleared from the
storage area of the processor.</p>
    <p num="0093">If no TCP/IP module is present in the storage
device 5, the resource manager 201 acquires the module
by download described above. The acquired TCP/IP
module is stored in the storage device 5 and then
written in the resource administration table 200. The
resource manager 201 checks again whether a TCP/IP
module is present in the storage device 5 by looking up
the resource administration table 200. If a TCP/IP
module is present in the storage device 5, the module
is loaded to the storage area of the processor as an
execution file. This processing enables subsequent
data communication.</p>
    <p num="0094">This operation will be described with reference to
FIGS. 31 and 32. As shown in FIG. 31, the speech
transmitter module 211 and speech receiver module 212
are loaded to the storage area of the signal processing
device 3, like FIG. 30. The storage device 5 stores
the data transmitter module 221, data receiver module
225, speech transmitter module 226, and speech receiver
module 227.</p>
    <p num="0095">In step S401, the DSP 210 executes signal
processing for speech communication using the speech
transmitter module 211 and speech receiver module 212.
In this state, assume that the user of the mobile radio
communication apparatus operates the input/output
unit 7 shown in FIG. 1A to input a designation of
a shift to data communication. The resource controller
4 receives this designation and outputs a resource
update request (step S402). The resource manager 201
checks whether a data communication module is present
in the storage device 5 by looking up the resource 
administration table 200 (step S403). If no data
communication module is present in the storage device
5, a download request is output. If a data
communication module is present, the DSP 210 is
notified of the start of rewrite (step S404). The DSP
210 stops executing a module currently present in the
storage area.</p>
    <p num="0096">Next, the resource controller 4 deletes the speech
transmitter module and speech receiver module, which
are currently present in the storage area of the DSP
210, using the rewrite processor 202. The resource
controller 4 also loads the data transmitter module and
data receiver module from the storage device 5 and
writes them in the storage area of the DSP 210
(step S405). When rewrite processing by the rewrite
processor 202 is ended, the resource controller 4
notifies the DSP 210 of the end of rewrite (step S406).
Upon receiving the rewrite end notification, the DSP
210 executes the data transmitter module and data
receiver module in the storage area to execute signal
processing for data communication (step S407).</p>
    <p num="0097">In this way, the modules in the storage area of
the DSP 210 (the resource of the DSP 210) are exchanged
under the control of the resource controller 4. With
this arrangement, the signal processing function of the
DSP 210 can be changed from the speech communication
function to the data communication function whereby the
signal processing function can be exchanged efficiently
using the capacity-restricted storage area of the DSP
210. Hence, occupation of the memory resource by an
unnecessary module can be suppressed.</p>
    <p num="0098">According to an example shown in FIG. 33, not a
DSP but a programmable hardware device capable of a
programmable rewrite, e.g., a PLD 230 is used as the
signal processing device 3. The PLD 230 is operated by
a module group 231 (e.g., modules A, B, C, and D).
The storage device 5 stores a module group 240 (e.g., 
modules A, B, C, D, E, F,...) which are assumed to be
used in the PLD 230. A module here means a module of
a circuit arrangement program (circuit arrangement
description) which makes, e.g., the layout/wiring
diagram of the PLD.</p>
    <p num="0099">Operation will be described with reference to
FIG. 34. First, the PLD 230 is executing signal
processing using the modules A, B, C, and D that form
a circuit arrangement for signal processing for speech
communication (step S501). In this state, assume that
the user who wants data communication operates
the input/output unit 7 show in FIG. 1A to input
a designation of a shift to data communication.
Upon receiving this designation, the resource
controller 4 outputs a resource update request
(step S502). The modules B, C, and D are assumed to be
modules used to form a circuit arrangement related to
signal processing necessary for both speech
communication and data communication.</p>
    <p num="0100">That the modules B, C, D, and E are necessary for
data communication is stored in advance. The resource
controller 4 checks the current module arrangement in
the PLD 230 to know that the module A must be replaced
with the module E. The resource manager 201 in the
resource controller 4 looks up the resource
administration table 200 (step S503) to check whether
the module E required to form a circuit arrangement for
signal processing for data communication is present in
the storage device 5 (step S504).</p>
    <p num="0101">If the module E is in the storage device 5, the
resource manager 201 designates the rewrite processor
202 to rewrite the module A in the module group 231
held by the PLD 230 to the module E. Upon receiving
this rewrite designation, the rewrite processor 202
notifies the PLD 230 of the start of a module rewrite
(step S505). Then, the PLD 230 stops executing
processing using the circuit arrangement of the 
currently held modules. Next, the rewrite processor
202 discards the module A held by the PLD 230, and
instead, reads out the module E from the storage
device 5 and replaces the module A with the module E
(step S506).</p>
    <p num="0102">When module rewrite processing for the PLD 230 by
the rewrite processor 202 is ended, the resource
controller 4 notifies the PLD 230 of the end of
the rewrite (step S507). Upon receiving the rewrite
end notification, the PLD 230 forms a circuit
arrangement using the newly held module group 231
(modules B, C, D, and E) and executes signal processing
for data communication using the circuit arrangement
(step S508).</p>
    <p num="0103">If it is determined in step S504 that the module E
is not present in the storage device 5, the resource
controller 4 outputs a download request (step S509).
In accordance with this request, the module E is
downloaded and temporarily held by the download
buffer 203. After that, the PLD 230 is notified of the
start of a rewrite in step S505 (step S505). In step
S506, the module E held by the download buffer 203 is
read out by the rewrite processor 202 and written in
the PLD 230. While download is progressing or
immediately after download is ended, the downloaded
module E can be written in the PLD 230. Hence, speech
communication can be changed to data communication in
a short time. The module acquired by download is not
only temporarily stored in the download buffer 203 but
also stored in the storage device 5 as needed and used
later.</p>
    <heading>(Seventh Embodiment)</heading>
    <p num="0104">In the sixth embodiment, in switching a signal
processing function of a signal processing device 3, of
a plurality of necessary modules, a module required to
realize a new signal processing function is replaced
with an unnecessary module. Instead, module groups 
each including a set of modules required for an
application purpose may be prepared, and a whole module
group may be replaced to switch a signal processing
function. With this arrangement, the signal processing
function of the signal processing device 3 can be
switched at a high speed.</p>
    <p num="0105">FIG. 35 shows a mobile radio communication
apparatus according to the seventh embodiment, which
replaces module groups. This mobile radio
communication apparatus can be adapted to a plurality
of different radio communication systems. Hence,
a storage device 5 stores module groups 241 and 242 for
executing communication signal processing in different
radio communication systems. These module groups 241
and 242 can be updated by exchanging the storage
device 5. A DSP 210 of the signal processing device 3
operates by loading a module group 213.</p>
    <p num="0106">Assume that the mobile radio communication
apparatus is currently communicating with a base
station under a radio communication system X. In this
state, assume that communication with the base station
under a radio communication system Y need be performed
for, e.g., hand-over. In this case, a resource manager
201 determines that the mobile radio communication
apparatus must communicate with the radio communication
system Y and controls the order of exchanging
resources, determination whether a resource is to be
exchanged, and timing of exchange. The resource
manager 201 designates a rewrite processor 202 to
release a module that is not used in the system X and
write a module for the system Y. Upon receiving this
designation, the rewrite processor 202 executes module
rewrite processing from the storage device 5 to
the DSP 210.</p>
    <p num="0107">The radio communication system X is currently
being used. For this reason, of the module groups for
the system X, which are written in the storage area of 
the DSP 210, modules which are being used must be
maintained. A module that is not used is checked
and released from the storage area of the DSP 210.
A module for the system Y is written in a storage area
serving as a resultant residual resource. With this
operation, the mobile radio communication apparatus can
communicate under both the radio communication systems
X and Y.</p>
    <p num="0108">Operation performed when in a state wherein the
DSP 210 is executing signal processing using modules
X1, X2, X3, and X4 for communication under the system
X, the module X1 is released and a module Y1 is loaded
to execute communication under the system Y will be
described with reference to FIG. 36.</p>
    <p num="0109">First, in step S601, the modules X1, X2, X3, and
X4 for communication under the system X has been
written in the storage area of the DSP 210. The DSP
210 is executing signal processing using the modules
X1, X2, X3, and X4. In this state, when, e.g.,
hand-over occurs, the resource controller 4 generates a
module update request (step S602). Upon receiving the
module update request, the resource manager 201 checks
whether a module group for the communication system Y
is present in the storage device 5 and also checks the
arrangement of the module group for the communication
system X by looking up a resource administration
table 200 (step S603).</p>
    <p num="0110">The resource manager 201 determines a module
necessary for communication under the radio
communication system Y, which module in the module
group for the radio communication system X should be
exchanged, and the order of exchanging the resource.
As a result, the resource manager 201 determines that
the module X1 is unnecessary, the module Y1 is
necessary, and the module Y1 should be written after
the module X1 is deleted. The resource manager 201
designates the rewrite processor 202 to rewrite the 
module X1 in the module group 213 held by the DSP 210
to the module Y1. Upon receiving this designation, the
rewrite processor 202 notifies the DSP 210 of the start
of a module rewrite (step S604). The DSP 210 stops
executing processing by the currently held modules.</p>
    <p num="0111">Next, the rewrite processor 202 discards the
module X1 in the module group 213 held by the DSP 210.
Instead, the rewrite processor 202 reads out the module
Y1 from the storage device 5 and replaces the module X1
with the module Y1 (step S605). When the rewrite
processing is ended, the resource controller 4 notifies
the DSP 210 of the end of the rewrite (step S606).
Upon receiving this notification, the DSP 210 executes
signal processing for data communication using the held
module group 213 (modules X2, X3, X4, and Y1) (step
S607).</p>
    <p num="0112">In this way, when modules in the DSP 210 are
exchanged under the management by the resource
controller 4, communication that has been executed
under only the communication system X can be executed
under the communication systems X and Y by effectively
using the module storage area (memory resource with
a finite capacity) of the DSP 210. Hence, hand-over
can easily be realized.</p>
    <p num="0113">Another operation example of this embodiment will
be described with reference to FIG. 37. Assume that
a mobile radio communication apparatus is communicating
under a radio communication system U. When the mobile
radio communication apparatus is going to do hand-over
to execute communication under another radio
communication system V at the boundary between cells
(i.e., service areas), modules are partially exchanged
such that the resource of the DSP 210 serving as
a signal processing device used in the radio
communication system U is gradually used in the radio
communication system V. With this arrangement, soft
hand-over can be done between different radio 
communication systems.</p>
    <p num="0114">More specifically, modules loaded to the DSP 210
and occupied in the system U are gradually occupied in
the system V. As for a module for the system V, if the
module is stored in the storage device 5 in advance,
the stored module is used. Otherwise, the module is
acquired by download.</p>
    <p num="0115">Referring to FIG. 37, in a state wherein
communication is being executed under the radio
communication system U (step S701), assume that
hand-off occurs and a module update request is
generated (step S702). In step S701, modules U1, U2,
U3, and U4 have been written in the storage area of the
DSP 210 as the module group 213, and the DSP 210 is
executing signal processing using these modules.</p>
    <p num="0116">The resource manager 201 determines the order of
exchanging the resource, whether a module is to be
exchanged, and the timing of exchange by looking up the
resource administration table 200 which stores the
storage location of a module executable in the DSP 210.
The resource manager 201 notifies the rewrite processor
202 and DSP 210 of the start of a rewrite on the basis
of the determination (steps S703 and S704). The DSP
210 stops executing processing by the currently held
module group 213. At this time, the module group 213
already written in the DSP 210 comprises the modules
U1, U2, U3, and U4 all of which are used for signal
processing for communication under the system U and
includes no modules for signal processing for
communication under the system V.</p>
    <p num="0117">The rewrite processor 202 releases the storage
area of the module U1 first to gradually rewrite the
module group 213 written in the DSP 210 under the
control of the rewrite processor 202. The rewrite
processor 202 writes a module V1 read out from the
storage device 5 in the released area (step S706).
Next, the rewrite processor 202 releases the storage 
area of the module U2 and writes a module V2 read out
from the storage device 5 in the released area
(step S707). In a similar manner, the rewrite
processor 202 releases the storage area of the module
U3 and writes a module V3 read out from the storage
device 5 in the released area (step S708). Next, the
rewrite processor 202 releases the storage area of the
module U4 and writes a module V4 read out from the
storage device 5 in the released area (step S709).</p>
    <p num="0118">In this way, the module rewrite for the storage
area of the DSP 210 is gradually executed by the
rewrite processor 202 under the control by the resource
manager 201. When all necessary modules are rewritten,
the resource manager 201 notifies the DSP 210 of the
end of the rewrite (step S710). Upon receiving this
notification, the DSP 210 executes data communication
processing using the currently held module group 213
(modules V1, V2, V3, and V4) (step S711).</p>
    <p num="0119">In this way, the module group 213 in the DSP 210
is gradually exchanged in correspondence with a
requested signal processing function under the
management of the resource controller 4. Hence, soft
hand-over between different radio communication systems
can be executed while effectively utilizing the module
storage area (memory resource with a finite capacity)
of the DSP 210, i.e., while suppressing occupation of
resource by an unnecessary resource.</p>

    <p num="0131">Assume that the user of the mobile radio
communication apparatus inputs to specify the use of
a desired radio communication system, e.g., system A by
operating keys of the display device 321. System A use
specifying information generated by this operation is
received by the resource controller 4. The resource
controller 4 recognizes the storage state of each
processing module required under the specified system A
and the assignment states to the resource of the signal
processing device 3 by looking up the module
administration table 300. If the necessary processing
module is not present, a download request of the absent
processing module is generated.</p>
    <p num="0132">The download request generated by the resource
controller 4 is transmitted from a wireless
transmitter-receiver device 2 to a base station
through, e.g., a control channel prepared as a channel
common to the respective radio communication systems.
In the base station, the processing module indicated by
the received download request is read out from a server
in the base station or a server provided on a network
to which the base station is connected, and transmits
the processing module to the mobile radio communication
apparatus as a request source.</p>
    <p num="0133">The processing module transmitted from the base
station to the mobile radio communication apparatus is
received by the wireless transmitter-receiver device 2
and transferred to the resource controller 4. The thus
received, i.e., downloaded processing module is 
temporarily held by the download buffer 303 and then
transferred to and stored in the storage device 5 by
the resource controller 4.</p>
    <p num="0134">Next, in the resource controller 4, a processing
module assignment request is output from the module
manager 301 to the module rewrite processor 302.
In accordance with the processing module assignment
request, the module rewrite processor 302 reads out
a necessary processing module from the storage device 5
and writes the processing module in the program
memory 311 of the signal processing device 3. In the
signal processing device 3, the DSP 310 executes the
processing module written in the program memory 311,
thereby realizing signal processing defined by the
processing module. Hence, the user of the mobile radio
communication apparatus can use the new function
by the processing module written in the program
memory 311.</p>
    <p num="0135">In controlling to read out a necessary processing
module from the storage device 5 and write the
processing module in the program memory 311, the module
manager 301 effectively uses the finite memory capacity
of the program memory 311 in the following way.
The order of exchanging processing modules in the
program memory 311, whether a processing module is to
be exchanged, and the exchange timing are controlled by
looking up the contents of the module use log table
3003 recorded in the module administration table 300.
The module manager 301 also controls to delete an
unnecessary processing module in various processing
modules held by the storage device 5 or upgrade a held
processing module. As a result of the control, if
a processing module required for the next processing
operation in the signal processing device 3 is not
present in the program memory 311, the module manager
301 generates a processing module assignment request.
The processing module assignment request is supplied to 
the module rewrite processor 302. The processor 302
writes the necessary processing module in the program
memory 311. In the signal processing device 3, the
processing module written in the program memory 311 is
executed by the DSP 310. Thus, a function realized by
the processing module written in the program memory 311
is realized by the mobile radio communication
apparatus. That is, the new function by the processing
module newly written in the program memory 311 is added
to the mobile radio communication apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0136">A plurality of processing modules can be written
in the program memory 311 of the signal processing
device 3. In the signal processing device 3, an
arbitrary processing module is executed by the DSP 310
while a plurality of processing modules are held by
the program memory 311. The capacity of the program
memory 311 and that of the storage device 5 are finite.
Since the order of exchanging processing modules in the
signal processing device 3, determination whether a
processing module is to be exchanged, and the timing of
exchange are controlled by the module manager 301, any
shortage of the capacity of the program memory 311 can
be suppressed.</p>
    <p num="0137">If every new processing module downloaded to the
mobile radio communication apparatus is stored in the
storage device 5, the free storage area of the storage
device 5 may be too small soon. When the storage
device 5 has no free storage area, a free storage area
must be ensured by deleting another processing module
stored in the storage device 5. In this case, it is
preferable to preferentially delete a processing module
unnecessary for the mobile radio communication
apparatus, i.e., a processing module which will be used
at a low probability in the mobile radio communication
apparatus for the next processing. For this purpose,
the use frequency of each processing module that was
used in the past is always monitored by the module 
manager 301, and a monitoring result is recorded in the
module use log table 3003 in the module administration
table 300. The module manager 301 deletes a processing
module with the minimum use frequency on the module use
log table 3003. With this operation, the free storage
area of the storage device 5 is ensured. A new
downloaded processing module is stored in the storage
device 5.</p>
    <p num="0138">FIG. 41A shows the list of items described in the
module use log table 3003 in the module administration
table 300. Items of the module use log are "module
name", "module size", "use frequency", "storage state",
and "assignment state". "Module name" is the name of a
processing module. "Module size" is the capacity of
the storage device 5, which is necessary to store the
processing module. "Use frequency" is the number of
times of use of the processing module in the mobile
radio communication apparatus. "Storage state" is
information representing the storage state of the
processing module in the storage area. More
specifically, if the processing module is stored, an
address of the program memory 311 is described. If the
processing module is not stored, the "storage state" is
"NO". "Assignment state" is information representing
whether the processing module is assigned to the
program memory 311. If the processing module is
assigned, the "assignment state" is "ON". If the
processing module is not assigned, the "assignment
state" is "OFF". A processing module whose resource
assignment state is "OFF" is stored in the storage
device 5 but not assigned to the program memory 311.
A processing module to be deleted is selected from
processing modules whose resource assignment states are
"OFF". When all processing modules are assigned to the
program memory 311, a processing module which to be
deleted is deleted after assignment to the program
memory 311 is canceled. </p>
    <p num="0139">FIG. 41B shows a detailed example of contents of
the module use log table 3003. In this example, "QPSK
modulation", "correlator", "convolution coding", "PN
coding", and "Walsh coding" are exemplified as module
names. Module sizes are 10,200, 15,300, 12,900,
25,000, and 18,000 bytes. Use frequencies are 320,
230, 202, 23, and 98 times. Storage positions are
0x100, 0x400, 0x5000, 0x3000, and NO (0x represents
hexadecimal notation). Assignment states are ON, ON,
OFF, OFF, and OFF.</p>
    <p num="0140">A processing procedure of deleting an unnecessary
processing module in the storage device 5 using use
frequency information recorded in the module use log
table 3003 shown in FIG. 41B will be described with
reference to FIG. 42. This processing procedure is
executed by the module manager 301. When module delete
starts (step S701), "use frequency" in items recorded
in the module use log table 3003 is looked up (step
S702). With this looking up, a processing module with
the minimum "use frequency" is detected from the
processing modules with assignment state "OFF".
A designation to delete that processing module from
the storage device 5 is supplied to the resource
controller 4. The resource controller 4 deletes
the processing module for which delete is designated
from the storage device 5 (step S703). The module
manager 301 deletes the log information of the deleted
processing module from the module use log table 3003
(step S704). The operation in steps S702 to S704 is
repeated until it is determined in step S705 that
a necessary free capacity is ensured.</p>
    <p num="0141">For example, according to the example of contents
of the module use log table 3003 shown in FIG. 41B, of
"convolution coding", "PN coding", and "Walsh coding"
which are processing modules with assignment state
"OFF", "Walsh coding" has the minimum "use frequency".
Hence, the processing module of "Walsh coding" is 
deleted. The log information of the processing module
of "Walsh coding" is deleted from the module use log
table 3003. When a necessary capacity is ensured in
the storage device 5, delete of processing modules is
ended (step S706). As a result, the contents of the
module use log table 3003 shown in FIG. 41B are updated
to those shown in FIG. 41C.</p>
    <p num="0142">With this procedure, the module manager 301
deletes processing modules. Processing modules with
high use frequencies, i.e., processing modules which
will probably be used for the next processing are
stored in the storage device 5. Since a processing
module which will probably be used need not often be
downloaded, the processing load on the mobile radio
communication apparatus is reduced.</p>
    <p num="0143">A case wherein the module use log table shown in
FIGS. 43A to 43C is used will be described next.
As shown in FIG. 43A that shows the list of items
described in the module use log table 3003, the items
of the module use log are the same as in FIG. 41A
except that "use frequency" is replaced with "latest
use date/time". More specifically, "latest use
date/time" is a latest time stamp when a processing
module read out from the storage device 5 is written in
the program memory 311. As shown in FIG. 43B, the
example of contents of the module use log table 3003
shown in FIG. 43B is the same as in FIG. 41B except
that 2005/04/14, 2005/12/21, 2003/05/04, 2005/02/03,
and 2005/08/14 are written as "latest use date/time".</p>
    <p num="0144">A processing procedure of deleting an unnecessary
processing module in the storage device 5 using latest
use date/time information recorded in the module use
log table 3003 shown in FIG. 43B will be described with
reference to FIG. 44. This processing procedure is
executed by the module manager 301. When module delete
starts (step S801), "latest use date/time" in items
recorded in the module use log table 3003 is looked up 
(step S802). With this looking up, a processing module
with the oldest "latest use date/time" is detected from
the processing modules with assignment state "OFF".
A designation to delete that processing module from
the storage device 5 is supplied to the resource

processing module for which delete is designated from
the storage device 5 (step S803). The module manager
301 deletes the log information of the deleted

(step S804). The operation in steps S802 to S804 is
repeated until it is determined in step S805 that
a necessary free capacity is ensured in the storage
device 5.</p>
    <p num="0145">For example, according to the example of contents
of the module use log table 3003 shown in FIG. 43B, of
"convolution coding", "PN coding", and "Walsh coding"
which are processing modules with assignment state

date/time". Hence, the processing module of
"convolution coding" is deleted from the storage
device 5. In addition, the log information of the
processing module of "convolution coding" is deleted
from the module use log table 3003. When a necessary
capacity is ensured in the storage device 5, delete of
processing modules is ended (step S806). As a result,
the contents of the module use log table 3003 shown in
FIG. 43B are updated to those shown in FIG. 43C.</p>
    <p num="0146">With this procedure, the module manager 301
deletes processing modules. Processing modules with
new latest use date/time, i.e., processing modules
which will probably be used for the next processing are
stored in the storage device 5. Since a processing
module which will probably be used need not often be
downloaded, the processing load on the mobile radio
communication apparatus is reduced. Additionally, when
the mobile radio communication apparatus is used by 
a user who frequently changes the use form, processing
modules can be efficiently added or deleted in
accordance with the use form.</p>
    <p num="0147">A case wherein the module use log table shown in
FIGS. 45A to 45C is used will be described next.
As shown in FIG. 45A that shows the list of items
described in the module use log table 3003, the items
of the module use log are the same as in FIGS. 41A
and 43A except that "use frequency" or "latest use

    <p num="0148">A processing procedure of deleting an unnecessary
processing module in the storage device 5 using module
size information recorded in the module use log
table 3003 shown in FIG. 45B will be described with
reference to FIG. 46. This processing procedure is
executed by the module manager 301. When module delete
starts (step S901), "module size" in items recorded in
the module use log table 3003 is looked up (step S902).
With this looking up, a processing module with the
largest "module size" is detected from the processing
modules with assignment state "OFF". A designation to
delete that processing module from the storage device 5
is supplied to the resource controller 4. The resource
controller 4 deletes the processing module for which
delete is designated from the storage device 5 (step
S903). The module manager 301 deletes the log
information of the deleted processing module from the
module use log table 3003 (step S904). The operation
in steps S902 to S904 is repeated until it is
determined in step S905 that a necessary free capacity
is ensured.</p>
    <p num="0149">For example, according to the example of contents
of the module use log table 3003 shown in FIG. 45B, of
"convolution coding", "PN coding", and "Walsh coding"
which are processing modules with assignment state

Hence, the processing module of "Walsh coding" is 
deleted from the storage device 5. In addition, the
log information of the processing module of "Walsh
coding" is deleted from the module use log table 3003.
When a necessary capacity is ensured in the storage
device 5, delete of processing modules is ended
(step S906). As a result, the contents of the module
use log table 3003 shown in FIG. 45B are updated to
those shown in FIG. 45C.</p>
    <p num="0150">When the module manager 301 deletes processing
modules in accordance with the above procedure,
processing modules each having assignment state "OFF"
and large module size are sequentially deleted from the
storage device 5. Hence, a necessary free storage area
is ensured on the storage device 5. When a processing
module having the largest size is deleted, an area
equal to or more than the necessary storage area is
ensured on the storage device 5 by one cycle of delete
operation at a high probability. Hence, a minimum
number of times of processing module delete operations
suffice, and the processing load necessary for delete
is reduced.</p>
    <p num="0151">An arrangement in which a function of checking

    <p num="0152">As shown in FIG. 47A that shows the list of items
described in the module use log table 3003, the items
of the module use log are the same as in FIGS. 41A and
43A except that "use frequency" or "latest use

revision information of a processing module.
For example, as shown in FIG. 47B, versions of "QPSK

and 1.8.</p>
    <p num="0153">A processing procedure of updating a module in 
the storage device 5 to a new version using version
information shown in FIG. 47B will be described with
reference to FIG. 48. When module update processing
starts, and a module update request, i.e., a new
processing module use request is input to the module
manager 301 (steps S1001 and S1002), the module manager
301 looks up the contents of the module use log
table 3003 in the module administration table 300
(step S1003) to check whether the necessary processing
module is present in the storage device 5 (step S1004).</p>
    <p num="0154">If the necessary processing module is not present
in the storage device 5, a processing module of
a necessary version is downloaded from a radio channel
(step S1005) and stored in the storage device 5
(step S1006). The processing module of new version is
newly stored in the storage device 5. Next, the module
rewrite processor 302 writes necessary processing
modules in the program memory 311, including the new
processing module in the storage device 5 (step S1010).</p>
    <p num="0155">If it is determined as a result of check in step
S1004 that the necessary processing module is present
in the storage device 5, the module manager 301
compares the version of the processing module in the
storage device 5 with the version of the actually
necessary processing module by looking up the module
use log table 3003 (step S1007). As a comparison
result, if the version of the processing module in the
storage device 5 equals the version of the necessary
processing module, the necessary processing module is
loaded from the storage device 5 and written in the
program memory 311 (step S1010).</p>
    <p num="0156">If it is determined as a result of check in step
S1007 that the version of the processing module stored
in the storage device 5 is older, the processing module
of the necessary version is downloaded from a radio
channel (step S1008) and replaced with the processing
module of the old version in the storage device 5 
(step S1009). The processing module in the storage
device 5 is updated to the processing module of new
version. Next, the module rewrite processor 302 writes
the necessary processing modules present in the storage
device 5 in the program memory 311 (step S1010).
When processing in step S1010 is executed, processing
module version update processing is ended (step S1011).</p>
    <p num="0157">In accordance with the example of contents of the
module use log table 3003 shown in, e.g., FIG. 47B,
consider a case wherein a convolution coding processing
module which is not assigned to the program memory 311
is used. Assume that the necessary version of the
convolution coding processing module is 4.0. The
module manager 301 knows that the convolution coding
processing module is stored in the storage device 5 by
looking up the module use log table 3003. According to
the module use log table 3003, the version of the
convolution coding processing module stored in the
storage device 5 is 3.1, i.e., older than the necessary
version 4.0. The module manager 301 requests the
wireless transmitter-receiver device 2 to download the
convolution coding processing module of version 4.0.
The convolution coding processing module of version 4.0
downloaded through the wireless transmitter-receiver
device 2 is replaced with the old processing module and
stored in the storage device 5. At the same time,
the module use log table 3003 is updated. After that,
the new processing module is assigned to the program
memory 311. In this way, every time a processing
module is used, the version of the necessary processing
module and that of a processing module stored in the
storage device 5 are compared. If the version of the
processing module in the storage device 5 is older, the
version is updated.</p>
    <p num="0158">An example in which the user who uses the mobile
radio communication apparatus selects a processing
module to be deleted to ensure the free capacity of the

next. To allow the user to select a processing module

selected processing module by himself/herself, the
display device 321 and input device 322 arranged in the
input/output unit 7 are used. As the input device 322,
a key input device such as a keyboard, cursor keys, or
cross key, a touch panel installed on the display
surface of the display device 321, or a pointing device
is used. When the user sets a mode to ensure a free
storage area in the storage device 5, the module names,
module sizes, and current assignment states of
processing modules currently held are displayed on the
display device 321. The user can select and designate
a processing module to be deleted by seeing the
display. For this purpose, the module manager 301 has
at least a function of managing the module use log
table 3003 in the module administration table 300 and a
function of extracting information of the module name,
module size, and current assignment state of each
processing module currently held by the storage
device 5. The resource controller 4 has a function of
displaying the pieces of information extracted by the
module manager 301 on the display device 321 and a
function of deleting a processing module to be deleted,
which is designated by user's operation on the input
device 322 in accordance with the display.</p>
    <p num="0159">The module manager 301 has (a) a function of
monitoring the presence/absence of a shortage of

modules in the program memory 311, determination
whether a processing module is to be exchanged, and
the exchange timing by looking up the module use log
table 3003, and (c) a function of controlling delete
and update of a processing module in the storage 
device 5. When a processing module assignment request
is output from the module manager 301 to the module
rewrite processor 302, the processor 302 writes, in the
program memory 311, a processing module obtained by
download through a radio channel or load from the
storage device 5. When the signal processing procedure
(processing module) which is thus written in the
program memory 311 is executed by the DSP 310,
a function realized by the written processing module is
realized in the mobile radio communication apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0160">Each module name in the module use log table 3003
has information of the file capacity of a corresponding

exchanged, rewriting information of the assignment
state of the processing module in the module use log
table 3003 and grasping the current state by using the
information of the file capacity. In accordance with
this function, when a mode is set to manage the free
capacity of the storage device 5, the module manager
301 acquires information to be displayed on the display
device 321 by looking up the module use log table 3003.
The resource controller 4 displays the information
acquired by the module manager 301 on the display
device 321 in a predetermined format.</p>
    <p num="0161">An input operation result by the user from the
input device 322 is recognized by the resource

selected module name from the storage device 5.</p>
    <p num="0162">The user can exchange a processing module by
inputting a designation for selecting a desired radio
communication system through the input device 322.
When the user specifies use of a radio communication 
system, e.g., the system A through the input device

resource controller 4. The module manager 301 knows
the information of a processing module necessary in the
specified system A from the module administration
table 300 by looking up the module administration
table 300, including the contents of the module use log
table 3003. The module manager 301 knows the storage
state of each processing module currently in use or the
assignment state to the resource (program memory 311)
of the signal processing device 3 from the information
in the module administration table 300. If the absence
of a processing module is recognized, the module
manager 301 generates a download request about the
absent processing module. The download request is sent
from the resource controller 4 to the base station
through the wireless transmitter-receiver device 2.
In the base station, the processing module indicated by
the received download request is read out from the
server and transmitted to the mobile radio
communication apparatus as a request source.</p>
    <p num="0163">The processing module transmitted from the base
station to the mobile radio communication apparatus is
received by the wireless transmitter-receiver device 2
and transferred to the resource controller 4. The thus
received, i.e., downloaded processing module is
temporarily held by the download buffer 303 by the
resource controller 4. At this time, the free capacity
of the storage device 5 is checked by the resource
controller 4. As a check result, if a capacity enough
to store the processing module held by the download
buffer 303 is present, the processing module is read
out from the download buffer 303 and stored in the
storage device 5. Accordingly, the module manager 301
updates the contents of the module use log table 3003.</p>
    <p num="0164">If it is found by check that the storage device 5
has no sufficient free capacity, the module manager 301 
deletes other processing modules stored in the storage
device 5 to ensure a storage area. After that, the
processing module read out from the download buffer 303
is held by the storage device 5. That is, if the free
capacity of the storage device 5 is too small, or if a
free capacity ensuring request is generated, the module
manager 301 extracts information of all processing
modules held by the storage device 5 by looking up the
contents of the module use log table 3003. On the
basis of the information, the module manager 301
controls the display device 321 to display the list of
the module names, module sizes, and states (current use
states) of the processing modules. On the basis of
this display, the user can know the module names and
capacities of the processing modules currently held by
the storage device 5 and whether each processing module
is being used. From this display, the user searches
for processing modules that are not being used, i.e.,
that have assignment state "OFF". When processing
modules with assignment state "OFF" are found, the user
selects a desired module using the input device 322 and
designates to delete the selected processing module.
In accordance with this designation, the resource
controller 4 deletes the corresponding processing
module in the storage device 5. In addition, the
module manager 301 deletes information related to
the deleted processing module from the module use log
table 3003.</p>
    <p num="0165">The flow of the above processing will be described
with reference to FIG. 49. When the user specifies
an unnecessary processing module delete mode by
operating, e.g., the input device 322, the module
manager 301 executes processing shown in FIG. 49.
When module delete starts (step S1101), the module
manager 301 looks up the module use log table 3003
(step S1102) to extract necessary information from
pieces of information recorded in the table 3003 and 
display the extracted information on the display device
321 (step S1103). The user selects and specifies
a processing module to be deleted from the display
contents by operating the input device 322 (step

module is being used in the mobile radio communication
apparatus. For a processing module that is not in use,
"-" is displayed.</p>
    <p num="0167">A processing module to be deleted is specified by
inputting a number representing the name of the module
to be deleted on the lowermost column of the display
window shown in FIG. 50C using the input device 322.
After that, when confirmation designating operation is
executed, the module rewrite processor 302 controlled
by the resource controller 4 deletes the specified
processing module from the storage device 5. As a
processing module to be deleted, one of processing
modules with assignment state "OFF" is preferably
designated. If there is no processing module with
assignment state "OFF", a module is appropriately
selected from processing modules with assignment state
"ON". The processing module is released and then
deleted.</p>
    <p num="0168">When the specified processing module is deleted in
this above way, the module manager 301 updates the
contents of the module use log table 3003 (step S1106). 
Operations in steps S1102 to S1106 are repeated until
it is determined in step S1107 that a necessary free
capacity is ensured in the storage device 5. When the
necessary free capacity is ensured, processing module
delete is ended (step S1108).</p>
    <p num="0169">In this manner, pieces of information related to
processing modules stored in the storage device 5 are
displayed on the display device 321. When the user of
the mobile radio communication apparatus selects
a processing module to be deleted by himself/herself by
looking up the displayed information, the signal
processing function of the signal processing device 3
can be selected. Hence, the mobile radio communication
apparatus can be customized to a function adapted to
the user's use form.</p>
    <p num="0170">In the above description, a processing module
necessary in the mobile radio communication apparatus
is supplied by download from a radio channel, i.e.,
from the network side through the base station.
Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 40A, the large-capacity
external storage device 9 may be connected to the
mobile radio communication apparatus through the
interface 8 to load a necessary processing module from
the external storage device 9 to the storage device 5
in the mobile radio communication apparatus. With this
arrangement, when an absent processing module or
a processing module of a new version is necessary,
the mobile radio communication apparatus can download
it from a route other than a radio channel.
In addition, when processing modules stored in the
storage device 5 are transferred to and held by the
external storage device 9, important processing modules
can be backed up. As the external storage device 9,
for example, a semiconductor memory card, hard disk
drive, MO (magnetooptical disk drive), CD-ROM drive,
CD-R/RW drive, or DVD drive can be used.</p>
    <p num="0171">In the above description, a processing module in 
the storage device 5 is deleted using one of
a plurality of items (e.g., use frequency, latest use
date/time, and module size) recorded in the module use
log table 3003 as a reference. Alternatively, the user
of the mobile radio communication apparatus may select
an arbitrary item to be used as a reference for
processing module delete from the plurality of recorded
items by himself/herself. In this case, processing
modules can be managed by the user himself/herself in
accordance with various use forms.</p>
    <heading>(11th Embodiment)</heading>
    <p num="0172">FIG. 51 shows a mobile radio communication
apparatus according to the 11th embodiment of the
present invention. In the following embodiment,
for the simplicity, assume that, e.g., two radio
communication systems (systems A and B) provide
services, and the mobile radio communication apparatus
can use an arbitrary one of the systems A and B.
The systems A and B are radio communication systems
provided by telecommunications carriers A and B.
The mobile radio communication apparatus shown in
FIG. 51 can use one telephone directory as telephone
directory files having formats dedicated to application
software unique to each of the systems A and B.</p>
    <p num="0173">A signal processing device 3 has a DSP 410 and
execution file storage section 411 which stores
modulation/demodulation execution files (processing
modules) that can be directly executed by the DSP 410.
A resource controller 4 has a CPU 401 and RAM 402
which records the current management situation of
the resource of the signal processing device 3.
An input/output unit 7 includes a display for
displaying various pieces of information for the user
and an input device such as a keyboard or cursor keys
which are used by the user for operation/input.</p>
    <p num="0174">A storage device 5 stores an execution file 501
and unique telephone number file 503 for a speech 
communication management system A, an execution
file 502 and unique telephone number file 504 for
a speech communication management system B, a common
telephone number file 510, a translator A 511, and
translator B 512.</p>
    <p num="0175">The unique telephone number file 503 for the
speech communication management system A is described
in a file format usable only in the speech
communication management system A. Similarly, the
unique telephone number file 504 for the speech
communication management system B is described in a
file format usable only in the speech communication
management system B. Hence, each of the unique
telephone number files 503 and 504 cannot be used in
another speech communication management system.</p>
    <p num="0176">The common telephone number file 510 is a
telephone directory file (telephone number list file)
described in a common file format, e.g., a text file
format, unlike the unique telephone number files 503
and 504 for the systems A and B. Use of the
application software in the mobile radio communication
apparatus is not allowed even using the file 510.</p>
    <p num="0177">The execution files 501 and 502 for the speech
communication management systems A and B are
application software for management related to speech
communication and have the following functions. The
execution files 501 and 502 display or search for and
display telephone number lists registered in the unique
telephone number files 503 and 504 serving as telephone
directories for the speech communication management
systems A and B by looking up the files 503 and 504,
respectively. When a desired telephone number is
selected and specified from the displayed telephone
numbers by user operation, the execution file 501 or
502 dials the telephone number. The execution files
501 and 502 can also add a telephone number that the
user wants to add to the telephone directory or delete 
an unnecessary telephone number. These application
software programs have a function of, when the radio
communication system is switched, or the unique
telephone number file 503 or 504 is changed,
controlling to convert the file using the translator
and update the contents.</p>
    <p num="0178">The translator A 511 and translator B 512 are
software programs for converting a file format.
The translator A 511 and translator B 512 are used to
convert the common telephone number file 510 serving as
a common list file into a list file unique to
an application used in a radio communication system
defined by a modulation/demodulation execution file or
vice versa. More specifically, the translator A 511
has a function of converting the list file unique to
the application software for the system A into the
common telephone number file 510, and the common list
file into the list file unique to the application
software for the system A. The translator B 512 has
a function of converting the list file unique to the
application software for the system B into the common
telephone number file 510, and the common list file
into the list file unique to the application software
for the system B.</p>
    <p num="0179">An example of operation of this embodiment
will be described. Assume that the mobile radio
communication apparatus is operating as a terminal
accommodated in the system A. In this state, the
modulation/demodulation execution file (processing
module) executed by the DSP 410 corresponds to the
system A. The file is stored in the execution file
storage section 411. At this time, that the DSP 410 is
executing the modulation/demodulation execution file
(processing module) corresponding to the system A is
recorded in the RAM 402 by the CPU 401. The user uses
the speech communication management system A dedicated
to the system A through the input/output unit 7. 
Hence, the execution file 501 for the speech
communication management system A, which is stored in
the storage device 5, is loaded into the resource
controller 4 and executed by the CPU 401.</p>
    <p num="0180">Assume that the user inputs a request for
displaying a menu list "telephone directory A" serving
as a list of telephone numbers of frequent data
communication partners (i.e., a telephone number list
based on the unique telephone number file 503 for the
speech communication management system A) on the
display through the input/output unit 7. At this time,
the CPU 401 in the resource controller 4 reads out the
contents of the unique telephone number file 503 for
the speech communication management system A, which are
loaded from the storage device 5 into the resource
controller 4, and displays the readout contents on the
display device in the input/output unit 7.</p>
    <p num="0181">After a call is made by referring to the display
of the telephone number file on the display device or
when a call is received, the user can add telephone
number information to be newly added to the menu list.
The new telephone number information to be added is
first written in the unique telephone number file 503
for the speech communication management system A, which
is loaded into the resource controller 4. Next, when
the user has completed use of the speech communication
management system A, the CPU 401 which is executing the
execution file 501 for the speech communication
management system A stores the rewritten unique
telephone number file 503 for the speech communication
management system A in the storage device 5.</p>
    <p num="0182">According to this embodiment, the telephone number
information in the rewritten unique telephone number
file 503 for the speech communication management system
A is managed after converted into the format of the
common telephone number file 510 by the translator A
511 stored in the storage device. Hence, the 
modulation/demodulation execution file which is being
executed by the DSP 410 is converted from a file format
corresponding to the system A into a file format
corresponding to the system B. For this reason, the
telephone number information can be used even when
another speech communication management system is used.</p>
    <p num="0183">More specifically, when the user has completed use
of the speech communication management system A
(application software, i.e., the execution file 501 for
the speech communication management system A) or when
the modulation/demodulation execution file which is
being executed by the DSP 410 is converted from the
file format corresponding to the system A to the file
format corresponding to the system B and the RAM 402 is
rewritten, the CPU 401 executes the translator A 511.
The unique telephone number file 503 for the speech
communication management system A is converted into the
common file format by the translator A 511. The common
telephone number file 510 is overwritten by the
converted file.</p>
    <p num="0184">The flow of this processing will be described
below with reference to FIG. 52. In the initial state,
assume that the user who is carrying the mobile radio
communication apparatus is located in the service area
of the system A, and the mobile radio communication
apparatus is functioning as a terminal adapted to the
system A. When the user moves, and the distance
between the system A and the base station increases,
the reception field strength of the mobile radio
communication apparatus becomes small. This makes it
difficult to make the mobile radio communication
apparatus function as a terminal of the system A.
At this time, assume that the user is located in the
service area of the system B, and the mobile radio
communication apparatus can ensure a sufficient
reception field strength for a base station in the
system B. </p>
    <p num="0185">The mobile radio communication apparatus has a
mechanism capable of switching the radio communication
system to be used by monitoring whether a communication
channel can be ensured between the apparatus and a
radio communication system using a pilot radio channel
that connects the base stations of the systems A and B.
Hence, the mobile radio communication apparatus cannot
maintain the channel to the system A anymore and can
instead know that a channel to the system B can be
ensured. At this time, the resource controller 4
changes the modulation/demodulation execution file
executed by the DSP 410 to the file corresponding to
the system B, which is stored in the execution file
storage section 411. This change is recorded in the
RAM 402 (step S2001).</p>
    <p num="0186">Before this time, it is checked whether the common
telephone number file 510 is overwritten by the
translator A 511 in accordance with the lately updated
unique telephone number file 503 for the speech
communication management system A (step S2002).
If the common telephone number file 510 is not
overwritten, the resource controller 4 executes the
translator A 511. Then, the unique telephone number
file 503 for the speech communication management system
A is converted into the common file format, and the
common telephone number file 510 is overwritten by the
converted file (step S2003). After that, processing
advances to step S2004. As a result of the check in
S2002, when the file is overwritten, processing
advances to step S2004. Processing in step S2004 is
not always necessary. In step S2004, the user
activates "telephone directory B" of the speech
communication management system B.</p>
    <p num="0187">In step S2005, the translator B 512 is activated.
The translator B 512 converts the file format of the
common telephone number file 510 into the file format
of the unique telephone number file 504 for the speech 
communication management system B. Thus, the unique
telephone number file 504 for the speech communication
management system B is generated or overwritten.</p>
    <p num="0188">As described above, the unique telephone number
files 503 and 504 for the speech communication
management systems A and B are described in file
formats which can be used only in the speech
communication management systems A and B, respectively.
When the contents of the file 503 or 504 change, the
changed file is temporarily converted into the common
file format and stored as the common telephone number
file 510. When the radio communication system used by
the mobile radio communication apparatus is changed,
the common telephone number file 510 is converted to
allow use under the changed radio communication system.
That is, even when the contents of the file 503 or 504
have been changed before the change in radio
communication system used by the mobile radio
communication apparatus, a file on which the change has
been reflected can be used under another radio
communication system to be used next by the mobile
radio communication apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0189">Hence, the user can reflect the unique telephone
number file 503 for the speech communication management
system A, which has been changed in the system A, on
the unique telephone number file 504 for the speech
communication management system B after the shift to
the system B. For this reason, the "telephone
directory B" on which the change has been reflected can
be used (step S2006). That is, when the menu list
"telephone directory B", i.e., the list of telephone
numbers that are frequently used in the speech
communication management system B used only in the
system B is displayed, the contents of the menu list
"telephone directory A" updated in the speech
communication management system A used in the system A
can be directly used. With this arrangement, the user 
need not individually manage data for different radio
communication systems and can use his/her latest
telephone directory independently of the radio
communication system.</p>
    <p num="0190">In the above description, the unique telephone
number files 503 and 504 for the speech communication
management systems A and B are present on the storage
device 5. However, these files 503 and 504 may be
temporary files generated on a memory in the resource
controller 4 as needed.</p>
    <heading>(12th Embodiment)</heading>
    <p num="0191">In a mobile radio communication apparatus
according to the 12th embodiment of the present
invention shown in FIG. 53, execution files 601 and 602
for the Web browsers A and B, unique URL (Uniform
Resource Locators) files 603 and 604 for the Web
browsers A and B, a common URL file 610, translators A
611 and B 612 are stored in a storage device 5. The
execution files 601 and 602 are Web browsing software
programs unique to the systems A and B used only in the
systems A and B, respectively, i.e., application
software programs for displaying the contents of a data
file of a WWW page. The execution files 601 and 602
are loaded to a resource controller 4 and executed by
the controller 4 to embody their function. The unique
URL files 603 and 604 are favorite URL information list
files described in unique file formats used by the
execution files 601 and 602 for the Web browsers A
and B, respectively. To the contrary, the common URL
file 610 is described in a predetermined common file
format.</p>
    <p num="0192">Translators A 611 and B 612 are application
software programs each for converting the file
format of the common URL file 610 into that of
a list file unique to browsing software used in
a radio communication system defined by
a modulation/demodulation execution file or vice versa. 
The translator A 611 has a function of converting the
unique URL file 603 for the Web browser A, which is
a list file unique to browsing application software for
the system A into the common list file, and the common
list file into the unique URL file 603 for the Web
browser A. The translator B 612 has a function of
converting the unique URL file 604 for the Web
browser B, which is a list file unique to browsing
application software for the system B into the common
list file, and the common list file into the unique URL
file 604 for the Web browser B. These unique URL files
603 and 604 are loaded to the resource controller 4 and
executed by the controller 4, thereby realizing their
functions.</p>
    <p num="0193">As described above, the unique URL file 603 for
the Web browser A is described in a file format which
can be used in only the Web browser A. The unique URL
file 604 for the Web browser B is described in a file
format which can be used in only the Web browser B.
Hence, in the Web browser A, no Web page address can be
specified unless a URL file described in the dedicated
file format is used. Similarly, in the Web browser B,
no Web page address can be specified unless a URL file
described in the dedicated file format is used.
According to this embodiment, a URL file is stored in
a format of a common list file. When a radio
communication system used by the mobile radio
communication apparatus is changed, the format of the
common list file is converted into a format for the
changed radio communication system by a translator.
The URL information of a Web page can be used on the
browser using the converted URL file.</p>
    <p num="0194">An example of operation of this embodiment
will be described. Assume that the mobile radio
communication apparatus is operating as a terminal
accommodated in the system A. In this state, the
modulation/demodulation execution file (processing 
module) executed by a DSP 410 corresponds to the
system A. The file is stored in an execution file
storage section 411. When a signal processing
procedure complying with the modulation/demodulation
execution file is executed by the DSP 410, the function
realized by the execution file is realized in the
mobile radio communication apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0195">The Web browser usable by the user through an
input/output unit 7 at this time is the Web browser A
used in only the system A. Under the control of the
resource controller 4 which is recognizing that the
mobile radio communication apparatus is operating under
the system A, the execution file 601 for the Web
browser A, which is stored in the storage device 5, is
loaded into the resource controller 4 and executed by a
CPU 401, thereby making browsing by the Web browser A
possible. In the Web browser A, a direct selection
function for a registered Web page address unique to
the Web browser A is prepared by the unique URL file
603 for the Web browser A.</p>
    <p num="0196">When the user wants to browse a Web page which is
often browsed on the window of the Web browser A and
performs predetermined operation on the input/output
unit 7, the Web browser A looks up the unique URL file
603 for the Web browser A and displays the favorite
menu list (URL information list of favorite URLs) in
the Web browser A. The user selects and specifies a
desired Web page from the displayed favorite menu list
on the input/output unit 7. Then, the resource
controller 4 controls a signal processing device 3 to
cause the DSP 410 to generate the URL information of
the Web page. The URL information is transferred to a
wireless transmitter-receiver device 2 and transmitted
to the base station in the system A. The base station
accesses a Web site indicated by the URL information on
the Internet through an Internet provider to read out
Web page information. The readout Web page information 
is transmitted from the base station to the mobile
radio communication apparatus through a reverse path.</p>
    <p num="0197">In the mobile radio communication apparatus, the
received Web page information is sent to the signal
processing device 3 through the wireless
transmitter-receiver device 2, processed by the DSP
410, and transferred to the resource controller 4. The
resource controller 4 displays the received Web page
information on the screen of the display device in the
input/output unit 7 by processing of the Web browser A
by the CPU 401.</p>
    <p num="0198">In this way, the user can browse a favorite Web
page by simple operation. Assume that the user found
a new interesting Web page while browsing Web pages.
The user can add the URL information of the found Web
page to the favorite menu list. In this case, the user
performs registration operation to the favorite menu
list. In the resource controller 4, the CPU 401 which
is executing the Web browser A additionally describes
the new URL information to be registered in the
execution file 602 for the Web browser B loaded in the
resource controller 4. After that, when the user ends
use of the Web browser A, the CPU 401 stores the
rewritten unique URL file 603 for the Web browser A in
the storage device 5. With this operation, the unique
URL file 603 for the Web browser A stored in the
storage device 5 is updated.</p>
    <p num="0199">The thus updated unique URL file 603 for the Web
browser A in the storage device 5 has a file format
dedicated to the Web browser A and therefore cannot
be referred to or updated by the Web browser B.
The unique URL file 603 for the Web browser A is
converted into a file having a common file format
and stored in the storage device 5 as the common URL
file 610.</p>
    <p num="0200">According to this embodiment, the URL information
of the rewritten unique URL file 603 for the Web 
browser A is converted into the format of the common
URL file 610 by the translator A 611 stored in the
storage device 5 and managed. Hence, even when the
modulation/demodulation execution file which is being
executed by the DSP 410 is changed from a file
corresponding to the system A to a file corresponding
to the system B and the Web browser B is used, the URL
information can be used.</p>
    <p num="0201">More specifically, when the user completes use of
the Web browser A, or when the modulation/demodulation
execution file which is being executed by the DSP 410
is converted into a file format corresponding to
the system A into a file format corresponding to
the system B and a RAM 402 is rewritten, the CPU 401
executes the translator A 611. The unique URL file 603
for the Web browser A is converted into a common file
format by the translator A 611. The common URL file
610 is overwritten by the converted file.</p>
    <p num="0202">The flow of this processing will be described
below with reference to FIG. 54. In the initial state,
assume that the user who is carrying the mobile radio
communication apparatus is located in the service area
of the system A, and the mobile radio communication
apparatus is functioning as a terminal adapted to the
system A. At this time, the resource controller 4
changes the modulation/demodulation execution file
executed by the DSP 410 to the file corresponding to
the system B, which is stored in the execution file
storage section 411, and this change is recorded in the
RAM 402 (step S2011). When the user moves, and the
distance between the system A and the base station
increases, the reception field strength of the mobile
radio communication apparatus becomes small. This
makes it difficult to make the mobile radio
communication apparatus function as a terminal of the
system A. At this time, assume that the user is
located in the service area of the system B, and the 
mobile radio communication apparatus can ensure
a sufficient reception field strength for a base
station in the system B. The mobile radio
communication apparatus cannot maintain the channel to
the system A anymore and can instead know that
a channel to the system B can be ensured, as described
above.</p>
    <p num="0203">Before this time, it is checked whether the common
URL file 610 is overwritten by the translator A 611 in
accordance with the lately updated unique URL file 603
for the Web browser A (step S2012). If the common URL
file 610 is not overwritten, the resource controller 4
executes the translator A 611. Then, the unique URL
file 603 for the Web browser A is converted into the
format of the common URL file 610, and the common URL
file 610 is overwritten by the converted file
(step S2013). After that, processing advances to
step S2014. Processing in step S2014 is not always
necessary. In step S2014, the user activates
"favorite" of the Web browser B by himself/herself.</p>
    <p num="0204">In step S2015, the translator B 612 is activated.
The translator B 612 converts the file format of the
common URL file 610 into the file format of the unique
URL file 604 for the Web browser B. Thus, the URL file
604 is generated or overwritten.</p>
    <p num="0205">As described above, the unique URL files 603 and
604 for the Web browsers A and B are described in file
formats which can be used only in the Web browsers A
and B, respectively. Hence, the Web browser A cannot
specify a Web page unless the unique URL file described
in the file format dedicated to the Web browser A is
used. Similarly, the Web browser B cannot specify a
favorite Web page even when it is found and registered
in the file unless the unique URL file described in the
file format dedicated to the Web browser B is used.
According to this embodiment, a unique URL file is
converted into the common URL file 610 having a common 
file format and stored. The common URL file 610 is
also converted into a file format corresponding to
a Web browser to be used. With this procedure, the URL
file can be used in the Web browser. Thus a Web page
list based on a unique URL file for a specific Web
browser can be used. The user who shifts from the
system A to the system B requires the unique URL file
604 for the Web browser B to display the favorite menu
list in the Web browser B which is used only in the
system B. According to this embodiment, the unique URL
file 604 for the Web browser B, on which the changed
contents are reflected, can be obtained by file format
conversion. For this reason, when the favorite menu
list is displayed, the contents of the favorite menu
list updated in the Web browser A used in the system A
can be directly reflected (step S2016). With this
arrangement, the user need not individually manage data
for different radio communication systems, resulting in
a large increase in convenience.</p>
    <p num="0206">In the above description, the unique URL files 603
and 604 for the Web browsers A and B are present on the
storage device 5. However, these files 603 and 604 may
be temporary files generated on a memory in the
resource controller 4 as needed.</p>

a file format unique to the mail system used in
a radio communication system defined by a
modulation/demodulation execution file or vice versa.
The translator A 711 has a function of converting the
unique received mail file 703 for the mail system A,
which is a received mail file unique to mailing
application software for the system A into the file
format of the common received mail file 710 having
a common file format. The translator B 712 has
a function of converting the common received mail
file 710 into the unique received mail file 703 for the
mail system A. These files 703 and 704 are loaded to
the resource controller 4 and executed by the
controller 4, thereby realizing their functions.</p>
    <p num="0209">As described above, the unique received mail file
703 for the mail system A is described in a file format
dedicated to application software which can be used in
only the mail system A. The unique received mail file
704 for the mail system B is described in a file format
dedicated to application software which can be used in
only the mail system B.</p>
    <p num="0210">The operation of this embodiment will be
described. Assume that the mobile radio communication
apparatus is operating as a terminal accommodated in
the system A. In this state, the
modulation/demodulation execution file (processing
module) executed by a DSP 410 corresponds to the system 
A and is stored in an execution file storage
section 411. When a signal processing procedure
complying with the modulation/demodulation execution
file is executed by the DSP 410, the function realized
by the execution file is realized in the mobile radio
communication apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0211">The mail system used by the user through
an input/output unit 7 at this time is the mail system
A dedicated to the system A. The execution file 701
for the mail system A, which is stored in the storage
device 5, is loaded into a memory (not shown) in the
resource controller 4 and executed by a CPU 401 in
the resource controller 4, thereby making the mail
system A usable.</p>
    <p num="0212">The user inputs a request for displaying a menu
list "received mail" serving as a list of received mail
messages addressed to himself/herself and stored in the
storage device 5 on the display through the
input/output unit 7. Upon receiving this request,
the CPU 401 displays the contents of the unique
received mail file 703 for the mail system A, which are
loaded from the storage device 5 into the resource
controller 4, on the display device in the input/output
unit 7. Hence, the user can browse the received mail
messages and return messages to them. If newly
received mail is present, it can be added to the list.
In this case, the CPU 401 additionally describes the
contents of the newly received mail in the unique
received mail file 703 for the mail system A, which is
loaded to the memory (not shown) in the resource
controller 4. After that, when the user ends use of
the mail system A, the CPU 401 stores the rewritten
unique received mail file 703 for the mail system A in
the storage device 5.</p>
    <p num="0213">According to this embodiment, even when the mobile
radio communication apparatus shifts to another radio
communication system, the file format is converted to 
make the previous received mail file usable. That is,
even if the mobile radio communication apparatus shifts
to the system B, the contents of mail received by the
mail system A dedicated to the system A and stored in
the unique received mail file 703 for the mail system A
when the mobile radio communication apparatus was using
the system A are made usable in the mail system B
dedicated to the system B. For this purpose, when the
unique received mail file 703 for the mail system A is
updated or the mobile radio communication apparatus
shifts to the system B, the unique received mail file
703 is converted into the format of the common received
mail file 710 by the translator A 711 stored in the
storage device 5 and managed by the common received
mail file 710.</p>
    <p num="0214">More specifically, when the user completes use of
the mail system A, or when the modulation/demodulation
execution file which is being executed by the DSP 410
is converted into a file corresponding to the system A
into a file corresponding to the system B and a RAM 402
is rewritten, the CPU 401 executes the translator A
711. The unique received mail file 703 for the mail
system A is converted into a common file format by the
translator A 711. The common received mail file 710 is
overwritten by the converted file.</p>
    <p num="0215">The flow of this processing will be described
below with reference to FIG. 56. In the initial state,
assume that the user who is carrying the mobile radio
communication apparatus is located in the service area
of the system A, and the mobile radio communication
apparatus is functioning as a terminal adapted to the
system A. At this time, the resource controller 4
changes the modulation/demodulation execution file
executed by the DSP 410 to the file corresponding to
the system B, which is stored in the execution file
storage section 411, and this change is recorded in the
RAM 402 (step S2021). When the user moves, and the 
distance between the system A and the base station
increases, the reception field strength of the mobile
radio communication apparatus becomes small.
This makes it difficult to make the mobile radio
communication apparatus function as a terminal of
the system A. At this time, assume that the user is
located in the service area of the system B, and
the mobile radio communication apparatus can ensure
a sufficient reception field strength for a base
station in the system B. The mobile radio
communication apparatus cannot maintain the channel
to the system A anymore and can instead know that
a channel to the system B can be ensured, as described
above.</p>
    <p num="0216">Before this time, it is checked whether the common
received mail file 710 is overwritten by the translator
A 711 in accordance with the lately updated unique
received mail file 703 for the mail system A (step
S2022). As described above, at this time, the file
format is converted from the unique received mail file
703 for the mail system A by the translator A 711, and
the common received mail file 710 is overwritten by the
file after conversion (step S2023). After that,
processing advances to step S2024. Processing in step
S2024 is not always necessary. In step S2024, the user
activates "reception box" of the mail system B.</p>
    <p num="0217">In step S2025, the translator B 712 is activated.
The translator B 712 converts the file format of the
common received mail file 710 into the format of the
unique received mail file 704 for the mail system B.
Thus, the received mail file 704 is generated or
overwritten (step S2025).</p>
    <p num="0218">As described above, the unique received mail file
704 for the mail system B is described in a file format
which can be used in only the mail system B. Hence,
with the above file conversion, when the user displays
the menu list "reception box" as the received mail list 
in the mail system B, the contents of the menu list
"received mail" updated in the mail system A can be
directly reflected (step S2026). The user need not
individually manage data for different radio
communication systems, resulting in a large increase in
convenience.</p>
    <p num="0219">In the above description, the unique received mail
files 703 and 704 for the mail systems A and B are
present on the storage device 5. However, these files
703 and 704 may be temporary files generated on the
memory (not shown) in the resource controller 4 as
needed. When the received mail in the above
description is replaced with transmitted mail, the same
management as described above can be done for the
information of mail transmitted by the user in the
past. The same management as described above can also
be done for the mail address information of frequent
mail transmission/reception partners of the user.</p>
