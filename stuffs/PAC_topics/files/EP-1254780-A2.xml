    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a recording material
that can record with high sensitivity to light in the
ultraviolet, visible and infrared regions and can be applied
to a wide range of fields, such as inks, color filters, holograms,
proofs, sealants, adhesives, surface printing, resin relief
printing and photoresists, and to an image forming method that
the recording material.</p>
    <heading>Description of the Related Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">Dry type image recording methods that do not use a liquid
developer and do not cause waste have been variously studied.
Among these recording methods, a method using a composition that
is cured with light is attracting attention. This method is
characterized in that a photocurable composition, which is
contained in the recording material, is cured by exposure to
form a latent image, and a component, which has a coloring or
decoloring reaction when heated, is moved to form a color image.
Specifically, light exposes a recording material through an
image copy, and a latent image is formed by curing the exposed
part. Thereafter, a visual image can be formed by heating the
recording material, and moving, in the uncured (unexposed) part,
the coloring or decoloring component, which is inside the 
recording material.</p>
    <p num="0003">According to the method, a completely dry system that
causes no waste can be realized. The method is characteristic
in recording a monochrome image and is particularly useful for
recording a color image.</p>
    <p num="0004">The inventors have proposed in JP-A No. 3-87827 and No.
4-211252 recording materials that suppress coloration in a
non-image part and provide a high image density. In the former
recording material, one of two components of a two-component
type photosensitive and heat-sensitive coloration recording
material is encapsulated in microcapsules, and the other is used
as a curable compound of a photo-curable composition, or the
other is contained outside the microcapsules with the
photo-curable composition. The later recording material has
a coated layer containing a photo-curable composition, which
contains microcapsules encapsulating an electron-donor
colorless colorant, and outside the microcapsules, an
electron-acceptor compound, a polymerizable vinyl monomer and
a photopolymerization initiator.</p>
    <p num="0005">There is a demand for these recording materials to provide
high glossiness to impart sophisticated feeling to an image.
Furthermore, improvements in light fastness of the image are
also desired in order to impart a value to the image such that
the image can be appreciated for a long period of time. </p>
    <p num="0006">The present invention is to solve the problems in the
conventional art and to attain the following objects.</p>
    <p num="0007">One of the objects of the invention is to provide a
recording material providing high glossiness and high light
fastness and a process for forming an image using the recording

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="0017">In the recording material of the present invention, at 
least one recording layer is formed on a support, encapsulated
the recording layer containing a coloring component A
encapsulated in heat-responsive microcapsules, and a
substantially colorless coloring component B, which is outside
the heat-responsive microcapsules and has a coloring site which
produces a color when reacted with the coloring component A.
The recording material has a protective layer, which contains
at least one layer, as the outermost layer of the recording
material on the side of the recording layer, and the protective
layer or a layer adjacent to the protective layer has a layer
containing titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>). Namely, when the protective
layer of the recording material of the present invention is
formed from one layer, this protective layer is formed as the
layer containing titanium oxide. Alternatively, when the
protective layer is formed from more than one layer, the layer
containing titanium oxide is formed on the outermost layer of
the recording layer and the protective layer, which is
different from the layer containing titanium oxide, is formed
on the layer containing titanium oxide. In both of these cases,
glossiness and light fastness can be imparted to the recording
material by the layer containing titanium oxide.</p>
    <p num="0018">Further, in the image forming method of the present
invention, image formation can be preferably performed onto
the recording material by an image forming method, which uses
the aforementioned recording material, and comprises an 
exposure step, a coloring step, and a fixing step.</p>
    <p num="0019">The recording material and the process for forming an
image of the present invention will be described in detail
below.</p>
    <heading>Recording Material</heading>
    <p num="0020">The recording material of the present invention may be
monochromatic or polychromatic. In the case of the
monochromatic recording material, one recording layer having
photosensitivity is provided, and a protective layer is
provided as the outermost layer of the recording material on
the recording layer side. In the case of polychromatic
recording material, at least one recording layer having
photosensitivity to a certain wavelength or lower is provided,
and at least one recording layer having sensitivity to a region
exceeding the certain wavelength is also provided, with a
protective layer being provided as the outermost layer. The
protective layer may have either a single layer structure or
a laminated layer structure having two or more layers. The
recording material may have an intermediate layer, and multiple
intermediate layers may be provided.</p>
    <p num="0021">The basic embodied structure of the recording material
of the present invention is not particularly limited and may
be appropriately selected depending on purposes there of.</p>
    <p num="0022">As one embodiment of the basic constitutional structure,
an example of image formation will be described below of a case 
in which the recording material of the invention is applied to
a positive recording material.</p>
    <p num="0023">In the positive recording material of this embodiment,
radicals are generated, upon imagewise irradiation with light,
from a radical generator contained in the photopolymerizable
composition on the irradiated part, and a polymerization
reaction of the polymerizable compound is initiated, hardening
the polymerizable compound so as to fix the photopolymerizable
compound thereon, whereby a latent image is formed. The
microcapsules have unpermeability to substances at or below
ordinary temperature, and thus the coloring component A
encapsulated in the microcapsules and the compound B having a
site, which colors when reacted with the coloring component A,
are not in contact with each other, and the microcapsules are
in a non-colored state.</p>
    <p num="0024">Thereafter, when heat is applied to the entire surface
of the recording material, the microcapsules are transformed
to have permeability to substances. B On the non-irradiated
portion, the compound penetrates into the microcapsules (and/or
the coloring component A is released to the outside of the
microcapsules), whereby the coloring component A and the
compound B react with each other to form a color only on the
non-irradiated part. On the other hand, because the
photopolymerizable composition is cured and in a fixed state
by the polymerization reaction in the irradiated portion, both 
the coloring component A and the compound B are immobilized and
are not in contact with each other, preventing coloration on
the irradiated part. Thereafter, by exposing the entire
surface of the recording material, the polymerizable
composition on the unpolymerized part are polymerized
(fixation), and the dye contained in the photopolymerizable
composition can be decolored.</p>
    <p num="0025">The recording material of the present invention may be
recording material of the following embodiments (first and
second embodiments), and the image forming method therefor may
also be appropriately selected in accordance with the
embodiments.</p>
    <p num="0026">In the recording material of the first embodiment of the
invention, the polymerizable compound contained in the
photopolymerizable composition is the compound B itself. That
is, the compound B has both the site coloring when reacted with
the coloring component A and the polymerizable group in one
molecule. The recording material comprises the coloring
component A, the compound B and the photopolymerizable
composition. In the case where the embodiment is applied to
an example of the positive recording material of the
aforementioned basic embodiment, the compound B has, as
described above, both the site that colors when reacted with
the coloring component A and the polymerizable group. The
compound B initiates a polymerization reaction and cures when 
irradiated with light in a shape of the image, whereby the
compound B is fixed thereon to form a latent image. Therefore,
the compound B is immobilized in the irradiated portion and does
not contact the coloring component A, and coloration does not
occur in the irradiated portion.</p>
    <p num="0027">In the second embodiment of the recording material of the
present invention, the recording layer contains the
substantially colorless compound B, which has a site that
colors when reacted with the coloring component A, the
substantially colorless compound C, which has a site that
suppresses the reaction between the coloring component A and
the compound B and a polymerizable group in the same molecule,
and a photopolymerizable composition.</p>
    <p num="0028">An example of image formation will be described where
the recording material of the present embodiment, having the
coloring component A encompassed in the heat-responsive
microcapsules, is applied to a negative recording material.</p>
    <p num="0029">Similar to the first embodiment, the microcapsules in the
negative recording material of the present embodiment have
unpermeability to substances at an ordinary temperature, and
thus the coloring component A and the compound B do not contact
each other, and are in a non-colored state. When the recording
material is irradiated with light in a form of an image, the
polymerization reaction of the polymerizable compound on the
irradiated portion is initiated and cured, and the 
polymerizable compound is fixed thereon to form a latent image.
Thereafter, when heat is applied to the entire surface of the
recording material, the microcapsules are transformed to be
permeable to substances, and the compound B on the
non-irradiated part penetrates into the microcapsules (and/or
the coloring component A is released to the outside of the
microcapsules). Simultaneously, on the non-irradiated portion,
the compound C penetrates into the microcapsules, as a
coloration suppressing compound, to suppress the coloring
reaction of the coloring component A and the compound B.
Therefore, the non-irradiated part is maintained in the
non-colored state. On the other hand, because the compound C
(coloration suppressing compound) on the irradiated part is
fixed thereon through a polymerization reaction, it does not
intervene in the reaction of the coloring component A and the
compound B, and the coloring reaction proceeds, and thus
coloration is effected only on the irradiated portion.
Thereafter, the entire surface of the recording material is
exposed to decolor the dye contained in the photopolymerization
composition.</p>
    <p num="0030">As a light source used in the image formation by the
recording material of the present invention, light sources of
blue to red and infrared lasers can be preferably selected.</p>
    <p num="0031">The respective layers constituting the recording
material of the invention will be described below. </p>
    <heading>Recording Layer</heading>
    <p num="0032">The recording material of the invention has a support
having a recording layer disposed thereon, and at least one
layer of the recording layer contains a coloring component A
encapsulated in heat-responsive microcapsules, at least one
substantially colorless compound B (hereinafter sometimes
referred to as a "coloring component B"), which is present
outside the heat-responsive microcapsules and has a coloring
site, which colors when reacted with the coloring component A,
and a photopolymerizable composition.</p>
    <p num="0033">The recording layer can be formed by coating a coating
composition, which is prepared by containing respective
components. An image can be formed on the coated recording layer
by, as described above, an image forming method having a step
of irradiating the recording layer with light, which
corresponds to sensitive wavelengths of the respective layers
to form a latent image (exposing step), a step of coloring a
color image by coloring the coloring components, which
correspond to the latent image, by heating (coloring step), and
a step of fixing the formed image and decoloring the dye through
irradiation of the surface of the recording layer with light
(fixing step).</p>
    <heading>Photopolymerizable Composition</heading>
    <p num="0034">The photopolymerizable composition constituting the
recording layer has at least a polymerizable compound, a 
photopolymerization initiator and an organic boron compound.</p>
    <heading>Polymerizable Compound</heading>
    <p num="0035">The polymerizable compound has at least one ethylenic
unsaturated double bond in the molecule thereof, is not

a water soluble polymer dissolved therein is used as a
protective colloid, and after adding the oily phase thereto,
emulsification dispersion is carried out by a means such as a

medium, which makes dispersion uniform and easy and stabilizes
the emulsified and dispersed aqueous solution. In order to make
the emulsification dispersion more uniform and stabile, a
surfactant may be added to at least one of the oily phase and
the aqueous phase. Known surfactants for emulsification can
be used as the surfactant. In the case where the surfactant
is added, the amount of the surfactant added is preferably from

to be used for encapsulation,can be used by being solid
dispersed with a means such as a sand mill along with the water
soluble polymer and other coloration assistants, but are more
preferably used as an emulsion dispersion, which is produced
by dissolving the oily components, such as the coloring
components, in a high boiling point organic solvent hardly
soluble or insoluble in water to form an oily phase, and mixing
a polymer aqueous solution (aqueous phase) containing the
surfactant and/or the water soluble polymer with the oily phase

    <p num="0159">The emulsion dispersion can be easily carried out, for

emulsification, such as high-speed agitation and ultrasonic
wave dispersion, and by known emulsifying apparatuses, such as
a homogenizers, Manton Goreys, an ultrasonic dispersing
apparatuses, dissolvers and KD mills.</p>
    <p num="0160">After the emulsion dispersion, the emulsified product is
heated to 30 to 70¬∞C to accelerate the capsule wall forming
reaction. In order to prevent aggregation of capsules during
the reaction, it is necessary that water is added to decrease
the collision probability of the capsules, and sufficient
agitation is effected.</p>
    <p num="0161">A dispersant for preventing aggregation may be newly
added during the reaction. Formation of carbon dioxide gas is
observed in association with progress of the polymerization
reaction, and the end point of the capsule wall formation
reaction can be detected by termination of the formation thereof.
In general, microcapsules encapsulating the objective dye can
be obtained by continuing the reaction for several hours.</p>
    <p num="0162">The average particle diameter of the microcapsules used
in the recording medium of the invention is preferably 20 ¬µm
or less, and more preferably, from the standpoint for obtaining
high resolution, 5 ¬µm or less. When the diameter of the
microcapsules thus formed is too small, the surface area per
unit solid content becomes large and requires a large amount
of the wall material, and therefore, the average particle
diameter is preferably 0.1 ¬µm or more. </p>

    <p num="0192">In the case where the antihalation layer is provided
between the support and the recording layer or on the surface
of the support, on which the recording layer is not provided,
an antihalation layer that can be bleached by irradiation of 
light or heat may be provided for a transparent support.</p>
    <p num="0193">In the case where the antihalation layer is the layer that
can be bleached by irradiation of light, for example, a
combination of an organic dye and an organic boron compound can
be utilized, and in the case where it is the layer that can be
bleached by heat, for example, such a constitution can be
utilized in that a base or a nucleophilic reagent is formed by
heat to bleach a coexisting organic dye.</p>
    <p num="0194">A layer containing a polymer having low oxygen
permeability, such as gelatins and polyvinyl alcohols (PVA),
may be provided between the support and the recording layer.
Color deterioration caused by photooxydation of the formed
image can be effectively prevented by providing this layer.</p>
    <heading>Production of Recording Material</heading>
    <p num="0195">The recording material of the invention can be produced
in such a manner that coating compositions for the recording
layer, the protective layer and the intermediate layer are
prepared by such a means that the components are dissolved in
a solvent depending on necessity, and they are coated on the
support by a known coating method, followed by drying. Examples
of the solvent include water; alcohols, such as methanols,
ethanols, n-propanols, isopropanols, n-butanols, sec-butanols,
methyl cellosolves and 1-methoxy-2-propanols; halogenated
solvents, such as methylene chlorides and ethylene chlorides;
ketones, such as acetones, cyclohexanones and methyl ethyl 
ketones; esters, such as methyl cellosolve acetates, ethyl
acetates and methyl acetates; toluenes; xylenes; and mixtures
of two or more of the above.</p>
    <p num="0196">Examples of the known coating method include methods
using, for example, blade coaters, rod coaters, knife coaters,
doctor roll coaters, reverse roll coaters, transfer roll
coaters, gravure coaters, kiss roll coaters, curtain coaters
and extrusion coaters.</p>
    <p num="0197">The coating operation can also be carried out with
reference to "Research Disclosure", vol. 200, Item 20036,
Section XV, December 1980.</p>
    <p num="0198">The multi-color recording material can be constituted,
for example, in the following manner.</p>
    <p num="0199">A first recording layer containing microcapsules, which
contain a coloring component that produces yellow and a
photopolymerizable composition sensitive to a center
wavelength Œª<sub>1</sub> of a light source is provided on a support, a second
recording layer containing microcapsules, which contain a
coloring component that produces magenta and a
photopolymerizable composition sensitive to a center
wavelength Œª<sub>2</sub> is provided on the first recording layer, and a
third recording layer containing microcapsules, which contain
a coloring component that poduces cyan and a photopolymerizable
composition sensitive to a center wavelength Œª<sub>3</sub> is provided on
the second recording layer. In the invention, at least one 
layer of the first to third recording layers is constituted to
have the first embodiment or the second embodiment described
above. A layer containing titanium oxide is then provided as
a protective layer on the outer surface of the third recording
layer. In the case where the protective layer contains multiple
layers, the outermost layer of the protective layer or a layer
adjacent to the outermost layer is the layer containing titanium
oxide. An intermediate layer may be provided between the
respective recording layer depending on necessity. The center
wavelengths Œª<sub>1</sub>, Œª<sub>2</sub> and Œª<sub>3</sub> of the light sources are different from
each other.</p>
    <p num="0200">In the case where a multi-color image is to be formed using
the recording material of the multi-color type, image exposure
is carried out in the exposing step described later by using
multiple light sources having different wavelengths, which are
adapted to the absorption wavelengths of the respective
recording layers, and thus the recording layers having the
absorption wavelengths of the light sources selectively form
respective latent images, thus forming a multi-color image of
high sharpness with high sensitivity. Thereafter, the surface
of the recording layer is further irradiated with light to
decolor the colored components (absorption components
corresponding to light of those wavelengths) remaining in the
layers, such as the organic dye, and therefore, a high quality
image having a low fog density and high contrast can be formed. </p>
    <p num="0201">According to the foregoing manner, the recording material
of the invention can be used in such purposes as a color printer,
a label, color proof, a duplicator, fax and intermediate paper.</p>
    <heading>Image Forming Method</heading>
    <p num="0202">The respective steps of the process for forming an image
of the invention using the foregoing recording material will
be described. The process for forming an image comprises an
exposing step, a coloring step and a fixing step, as described
above.</p>
    <p num="0203">In the exposing step, the photopolymerizable composition
and the substantially colorless compound, which has a site
producing a color through a reaction with the coloring component
in the recording layer, is exposed in a pattern of an image form,
whereby it is cured in the pattern.</p>
    <p num="0204">In the exposing step, the light source used for image
formation is preferably selected from light sources having
wavelengths adapted to the respective absorption wavelengths
from the standpoint of obtaining high sensitivity and high
sharpness. Specifically, known light sources having
wavelengths from ultraviolet to infrared regions can be used
by selecting from light sources having maximum absorption
wavelengths in a range of from 300 to 1,000 nm. For example,
laser light sources of blue, green, violet and red and an LED
are preferred since the apparatus can be simplified and
miniaturized, and the cost can be reduced. </p>
    <p num="0205">After carrying out the exposing step, the coloring step
is performed. In the coloring step, the surface of the
recording layer is heated to react the coloring component
contained in the recording layer and the substantially
colorless compound producing a color by reacting with the
coloring component and having a site that produces a color when
reacted with the coloring component, whereby coloration occurs
in the form of the latent image being formed and producing a
visual image.</p>
    <p num="0206">The heating operation is carried out with a heat roller,
and in general, the heating temperature is preferably from 80
to 200¬∞C, and more preferably from 85 to 130¬∞C. When the heating
temperature is less than 80¬∞C, the coloring density may become
insufficient, and when it exceeds 200¬∞C, the non-image part
(background part) may form a color, and the support may be
damaged. The heating time is preferably from 1 second to 5
minutes, and more preferably from 3 seconds to 1 minute.</p>
    <p num="0207">Upon carrying out the heating operation, further high
sensitivity can be obtained by performing a preheating step,
in which the entire surface of the recording material is
uniformly preheated to a prescribed temperature lower than the
coloring temperature.</p>
    <p num="0208">After carrying out the coloring step, the fixing step is
performed. In the fixing step, the entire surface of the
recording material is irradiated with light by a particular 
light source, whereby the image formed in the coloring step is
fixed, and the coloration due to the colored component (organic
dye) remaining in the recording layer is decolored.</p>
    <p num="0209">Through the fixing step, whiteness of the non-image part
can be improved to obtain a chemically stable final image. In
the case where a diazonium salt compound is used as the coloring
component, the diazonium salt compound remaining in the
recording material after the image formation can be deactivated
by irradiation with light, and thus it is useful for
stabilization upon storing the formed image without
fluctuations in density and discoloration.</p>
    <p num="0210">Preferred examples of the light source that can be used
in the fixing step include wide varieties of light sources, such
as mercury lamps, ultra-high pressure mercury lamps,
electrodeless discharge type mercury lamps, xenon lamps,
tungsten lamps, metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps.</p>
    <p num="0211">The method for irradiation with light in the fixing step
is not particularly limited. While both the following methods
may be used, i.e., a method of irradiating the entire surface
of the recording layer at the same time, and a method of gradually
irradiating the recording surface, for example, by scanning,
whereby the entire surface is finally irradiated, a method can
be employed such that the entire recording surface of the
recording material after the image formation can be irradiated
with substantially uniform irradiation light. Accordingly, it 
is preferred that the entire recording surface is irradiated
with light from the standpoint that the effects of the invention
are effectively achieved.</p>
    <p num="0212">The time for irradiating with light in the fixing step
may be such a period that the formed image is fixed, and the
non-image part (background part) is sufficiently decolored, and
in order to obtaining sufficient image fixing property and
decoloration property with no deterioration in recording rate,
it is preferably from several seconds to several tens minutes,
and more preferably from several seconds to several minutes.</p>
    <p num="0213">According to the process for forming an image of the
invention, when the heating operation in the coloring step is
carried out with a heat roller, an image can be successfully
formed without any influence on the layer containing titanium
oxide of the recording layer. A thermal head, on the other hand,
is not preferrable since titanium oxide fine particles are
attached to the thermal head.</p>
