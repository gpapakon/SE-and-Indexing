    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to an antenna
apparatus used for small sized communication equipment
such as a mobile phone.</p>
    <p num="0002">Conventionally, to downsize a mobile phone or the

type chip antenna on a printed circuit board is known.</p>
    <p num="0003">In order to downsize the communication equipment,
it is necessary to downsize the chip antenna as
small as possible. However, there is a problem that,
a bandwidth of an antenna is narrowed by downsizing
the chip antenna.</p>
    <p num="0004">It is an object of the present invention to
provide an antenna apparatus whose size is smaller and
whose bandwidth is wide.</p>
    <p num="0005">An antenna apparatus according to the present
invention is characterized by comprising: a substrate;
a chip antenna mounted on the substrate; and a ground
pattern disposed on the substrate, at least a portion
on the side of a power supply terminal of an antenna
conductor in the chip antenna being overlapped with
the ground pattern.</p>
    <p num="0006">With such a configuration, the size of the
substrate can be reduced by the overlapped size of
the chip antenna and the ground pattern side, and the
matching of the chip antenna and power supply line can
be easily obtained. </p>

the ground pattern 18.</p>
    <p num="0012">In the above described configuration, the matching
between the chip antenna 12 and a coaxial power supply
line 14 can be easily achieved by adjusting the size B
such that the chip antenna 12 is overlapped with the
ground pattern 18, and the VSWR (voltage stationary
wave ratio) can be lowered. In the conventional
configuration, it is necessary to consider the shape
of an antenna conductor or a position of a power
supply terminal section in order to lower the VSWR.
In addition, there is a problem that the bandwidth is
narrowed, if the antenna device is designed to lower
the VSWR.</p>
    <p num="0013">The antenna apparatus shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B
is an antenna apparatus to downsize a chip antenna 
in the antenna device shown in FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B.
The chip antenna is configured as follows. The width
of the dielectric chip 20 is smaller than the meander
width of the antenna conductor 22; an intermediate
portion in the meander width direction of the antenna
conductor 22 is embedded in the dielectric chip 20; and
a both side portion is bent along the surface of the
dielectric chip 20.</p>
    <p num="0014">FIG. 3 shows a result obtained by measuring
a relationship between the overlapped size B and the
VSWR in the antenna apparatus as shown in FIG. 2A and
FIG. 2B. FIG. 4 shows a result obtained by measuring
a relationship between the overlapped size B and the
bandwidth in the antenna apparatus as shown in FIG. 2A
and FIG. 2B. The size of the print circuit board 10
used is 33 mm in width × 150 mm in length (size of
the insulation substrate 16); the size of the ground
pattern 18 is 33 mm in width × 120 mm in length;
the size of a fixed pad 32 is 2 mm in width × 1 mm in
length; the external size of the chip antenna 12 is
4.2 mm in width × 16 mm in length × 1.1 mm in
thickness; the dense portion 22a in meander pitches of
the meander antenna conductor 22 is 150/150 microns in
ratio between a line interval and a line width, and has
27 turns; and the coarse portion 22b in meander pitches
is 200/200 microns in ratio between a line interval and
a line width, and has 17 turns. The meander width of
the meander antenna conductor before bent is 8.7 mm.
In FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, when the overlapped size B is
negative, it indicates the state that the chip antenna
is apart from the ground pattern 18 as shown in FIG. 5A
and FIG. 5B, and when the size B is positive, it
indicates the state that the chip antenna and the
ground pattern 18 are overlapped as shown in FIG. 2A
and FIG. 2B. Measurement was carried out by connecting
the coaxial power supply line 14 to a network analyzer.
The resonance frequency is 1033 MHz when B = 3 mm. </p>
    <p num="0015">As seen from FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, when a mount
structure according to the first embodiment is
employed, the VSWR can be adjusted by adjusting
the mount position (size B) of the chip antenna 12.
Therefore, the VSWR can be easily adjusted, and
an effect that a bandwidth becomes broad where the VSWR
is low can be obtained. That is, there is an advantage
that matching can be easily obtained. Conventionally,
when the VSWR is lowered, the bandwidth is narrowed.
However, this disadvantage is remarkably improved
according to the first embodiment. In the first
embodiment, the side of the dense portion 22a in
meander pitches is overlapped with the ground
pattern 18, and thus, the above-described effect is
particularly remarkable. In addition, the printed
circuit board 10 can be smaller than conventionally
in size A of a region for antenna mounting (a region
free of the ground pattern 18), which is effective in
downsizing of communication equipment.</p>
    <p num="0016">Fixed pad sections 30A and 30B formed on the

a ground pattern 18 and a pad 32 formed at a position

the chip antenna 12 is mounted on the printed circuit
board 10. The pad 32 is formed so as not to be
protruded from the tip of the chip antenna 12, thereby
making it possible to further reduce the size A of the
region where there is no the ground pattern 18 of the

    <p num="0033">A chip antenna 12 according to the sixth
embodiment is substantially similar to that according
to the first embodiment in shape of the meander antenna
conductor 22. However, a meander antenna conductor 22
formed in a planer shape is embedded in the dielectric
chip 20. In the meander antenna conductor 22, meander
is advanced in a unidirectional manner. This antenna
conductor 22 has a dense portion 22a and a coarse
portion 22a in meander pitches. The dense portion 22a
in meander pitches is provided on the side of the power
supply terminal 26 of the antenna conductor 22. On the
other hand, the coarse portion 22b in meander pitches
is provided at the tip side. The dense portion 22a
and coarse portion 22b in meander pitches are formed,
respectively, so that meander is repeated in the
plurality of pitches. In addition, the dense portion
22 in meander pitches is formed to have more turns
(here, the number of turns corresponds to twice of
pitches in number) than the coarse portion 22b in
meander pitches. The power supply terminal 26 is
protruded outside of the dielectric chip 20, and
the tip part of the antenna conductor 22 is bent along
an outer surface of the dielectric chip 20, thus
configuring a fixed terminal 27. The power supply 
terminal 26 may also be formed in a manner similar to
the fixed terminal 27. The bandwidth can be more
widened by broadening the conductor line width of
the coarse portion 22b in meander pitches than the
conductor line width of the dense portion 22a.</p>
    <p num="0034">In examples shown in FIG. 14A and FIG. 14B, the

antenna 12 is mounted so that a part of the power
supply terminal 26 is overlapped with the ground
pattern 18, and a center conductor 24 of a coaxial
power supply line 14 is connected to the power supply
terminal 26. An external conductor 28 of the coaxial

    <p num="0038">According to Table 1, it is found that the

frequency when power is supplied from the side at
which meander pitched are dense can be lowered more
remarkably than that when power is supplied from the
side at which the pitches are coarse. Although the
center frequency can be lowered in antenna densely
downsized while meander pitches are constant
(Comparative Example 1), there is a difficulty that

    <p num="0039">FIG. 16A and FIG. 16B are views each showing

    <p num="0040">The chip antenna 12 according to the seventh
embodiment is configured as follows. An intermediate
portion in the meander width direction of the meander
antenna conductor 22 is embedded in a dielectric

direction are returned so as to be overlapped with the
intermediate portion along the outer periphery surface
of the dielectric chip 20, and the meander antenna
conductor 22 is formed in a three-dimensional manner.
With this configuration, the width of the chip antenna
12 can be reduced. A resin coating 21 is provided on
a surface on which the both end parts in the meander
width direction of the meander antenna conductor 22 is

    <p num="0041">The seventh embodiment is the same as the sixth

arranging a power supply terminal 26 and a fixed

    <p num="0042">Next, the performance of the chip antenna
configured as shown in FIG. 16A and FIG. 16B is
checked. The chip antenna according to the present
invention, which is provided for test, has two types of
which a power supply terminal is provided at the side
of the dense portion in meander pitches (Example 3),
and on the contrary, a power supply terminal is
provided at the side at the coarse portion in meander
pitches (Example 4). The sizes or the like of both
of these antennas are as follows. Both end parts in
the meander width direction of the meander antenna
conductor, i.e., a portion of width 1 = (1.4) mm, were
turned back, and the external size of the antenna was
set to 16 × 4.4 × 1.2 mm. These Examples 3 and 4 are
the same as Examples 1 and 2 except that a dielectric
rate of the dielectric chip was set to 20. The sizes 
or the like of the circuit substrate are the same as
well.</p>
    <p num="0043">For comparison, by using a meander antenna
conductor which is the same as that according to
Comparative Example 1, the chip antenna (Comparative
Example 2) returned at both end parts in the meander
width direction is fabricated in the same manner as
that according Example 3 and Example 4, and the same
tests are carried out for this antenna. The result is
shown in Table 2.

    <p num="0044">The above result shows a tendency which is similar
to that shown in Table 1. In addition, from the result
shown in Table 2, it is found that the dense side power
supply has a broader ratio bandwidth than the coarse
side power supply in an antenna turned back at the
width end part as shown in FIG. 16A and FIG. 16B.
Moreover, the center frequency is lower in dense side
power supply. From this result, it is found that, when
dense side power supply is carried out at dense and
coarse meanders in return, "downsizing" and "wider
bandwidth" can be achieved at the same time. </p>
    <p num="0045">In the sixth embodiment and seventh embodiment,

    <p num="0046">FIG. 17A and FIG. 17B are views each showing an
antenna apparatus according to an eighth embodiment of
the present invention. In FIG. 17A and FIG. 17B, the
same elements of the antenna apparatus shown in FIG. 1A
and FIG. 1B are designated by the same reference
numerals.</p>
    <p num="0047">The antenna apparatus according to the eighth
embodiment mounts a chip antenna on a printed circuit
board 10 having a ground pattern 18 on one surface of
an insulation substrate 16. The printed circuit board
10 has a rectangular pad 32 for mounting the antenna at
a position distant from an edge of the ground pattern
18 of a surface at the opposite side of the ground
pattern 18 on the insulation substrate 16. The tip
part of the chip antenna 12 is positioned on the pad
32, and the base end part (at the side of the power
supply terminal) thereof the chip antenna is mounted so
that the base end part is overlapped with the ground
pattern 18. A coaxial power supply line 14 is
connected to the chip antenna 12. A strip line formed
on the printed circuit board 10 may be used instead of
the coaxial power supply line 14. As shown in FIG. 21,
the chip antenna 12 has a meander antenna conductor 22
provided inside of the dielectric chip 20. The meander
antenna conductor 22 is bent so that both end parts of
the meander width direction is overlapped with the
intermediate portion (namely, so that both ends in
the meander width direction are close to each other).
In addition, the meander antenna conductor 22 is formed
so that the meander pitches are dense at the side of
the power supply terminal 26, and the meander pitches 
are coarse at the tip side. The dense portion 22a and
coarse portion 22b in meander pitches of the meander
antenna conductor 22 are formed, respectively, so that
meandering is repeated in a plurality of pitches.
The power supply terminal 26 is a portion to which the
center conductor 24 of the coaxial power supply line 14
is connected. In addition, a first fixed terminal 27
is formed at a position corresponding to the back side
of the power supply terminal 26, and a second fixed
terminal 40 is formed at a position corresponding to
the back side at a tip of the meander antenna conductor
22. The second fixed terminal 40 is electrically
conductive to the meander antenna conductor 22 via
a conductor 22c going round an end surface of a
dielectric chip 20. In addition, a resin cover 21
is provided on a surface on which both end parts in
the meander width direction of the meander antenna
conductor 22 of the dielectric chip 20 are mounted.
In the chip antenna formed as mentioned above, the
first fixed terminal 27 is positioned on the pad 41,
and the second fixed terminal 40 is positioned on the
pad 32, whereby the antenna is mounted so that part or
all of the dense portion 22a in meander pitches is
overlapped with the ground pattern 18. This mounting
is carried out in the same manner as that in general
surface mount type parts. When the antenna is mounted
so that the dense portion 22a in meander pitches of
the meander antenna conductor 22 is overlapped with
the ground pattern 18, the matching between the chip
antenna 12 and coaxial power supply line 14 can be
easily achieved by adjusting the overlapped size.</p>
    <p num="0048">The antenna of FIG. 17 is manufactured for test
and the performance thereof is checked. It is found
that a bandwidth greatly changes due to the size of
the pad 32 formed on the printed circuit board 10.
Thus, various tests are carried out by changing a width
W and a length L of the pad 32. The result is shown 
in FIG. 18 to FIG. 20. The chip antenna 12 used is
bent on the intermediate portion at both end parts in
the meander width direction of the meander antenna
conductor 22, as shown in FIG. 21A and FIG. 21B.
The meander pitches are dense at the side of the power
supply terminal 26, and are coarse at the further tip
side. The meander width of the meander conductor 22
(the width direction when extended) is 8.7 mm; the
length in the meander direction is 15 mm; the dense
portion 22a in meander pitches is 150/150 microns in
ratio between a conductor width and a conductor
interval and has 27 turns, and the coarse portion 22b
in meander pitches is 200/200 microns in ratio between
a conductor width and a conductor internal and has 17
turns; and the size in the meander width direction
after bending both end portions is 4 mm. The thickness
of the dielectric chip 20 is 1 mm, and the dielectric
rate is 20. The chip antenna 12 is mounted so as to be
overlapped with the ground pattern by 3 mm at the side
of the power supply terminal 26 of the meander antenna
conductor 22 and so as to be overlapped with the pad 32
by 3 mm at the tip side.</p>
    <p num="0049">FIG. 18 shows a result obtained by measuring
a change in bandwidth when the pad width W and length L
are changed. According to the figure, it is found
that, as long as the pad width W is 8 mm or less,
which is twice of the size (4 mm) in the meander width
direction of the meander antenna conductor 22, a wide
bandwidth is obtained. In addition, if the pad width
is larger than two times of the size in the meander
width direction of the meander antenna conductor 22,
it is found that the bandwidth is greatly lowered.
Therefore, it is required to set the pad width W to
be twice or less of the size in the meander width
direction of the meander antenna conductor.</p>
    <p num="0050">In order to ensure wider bandwidth, it is
preferable that the pad width W is to be 1.75 times 
or less of the size in the meander width direction
of the meander antenna conductor. It is further
preferable that the width is to be 1.5 times or less.
In addition, even if the pad width is reduced, the
bandwidth is not narrowed. However, in consideration
of the stability when the chip antenna is mounted, it
is preferable that the pad width W is to be 0.5 times
or more of the size in the meander width direction
of the meander antenna conductor. It is further
preferable that the width is to be 1 times or more.
FIG. 19 shows a result obtained by measuring a
resonance frequency when the pad width W and length L
are changed. Accordingly, it is found that an increase
in pad width W can lower the resonance frequency.
This is because an increase in pad width introduces the
same effect as lengthening an antenna conductor length.</p>
    <p num="0051">FIG. 20 shows a result obtained by measuring the
VSWR when the pad width W and length L are changed.
From this result as well, it is found that the pad
width is to be 8 mm, which is twice or less of the
meander width size of the meander antenna conductor.</p>
    <p num="0052">In the eighth embodiment, a chip antenna may be
formed in the shape as shown in FIG. 22A to FIG. 22C as
in the first embodiment. In this chip antenna 12, the
meander antenna conductor 22 is provided on the surface
(or inside) of a dielectric chip 20 with its high
dielectric rate. The meander antenna conductor 22 is
formed so as to dense in meander pitches at the side of
the power supply terminal 26 and so as to be coarse in
meander pitches at the tip side. The dense portion 22a
and coarse portion 22b in meander pitches of the
meander antenna conductor 22 are formed, respectively
so that meander is repeated in a plurality of pitches.
The power supply terminal 26 is a portion to which the
center conductor 24 of the coaxial power supply line 14
is connected. In addition, on the back surface of the
dielectric chip 20, a first fixed terminal 27 is formed 
at a position corresponding to the back side of the
power supply terminal 26, and a second fixed terminal
40 is formed at a position corresponding to the back
side at the tip of the meander antenna conductor 22.
The second fixed terminal 40 is electrically conductive
to the meander antenna conductor 22 via the conductor
22c going round an end surface of the dielectric chip
20. The first fixed terminal 27 is positioned on the
pad 41, and the second fixed terminal 40 is positioned
on the pad 32, whereby the antenna is mounted so that
part or all of the dense portion 22a in meander pitches
is overlapped with the ground pattern 18. This
mounting is carried in the same way as that for a
surface mount type parts. When the antenna is mounted
so that the dense portion 24a in meander pitches of
the meander antenna conductor 22 is overlapped with
the ground pattern 18, the matching between the chip
antenna 12 and the coaxial power supply line 14 can
be easily achieved by adjusting the overlapped size.</p>
    <p num="0053">When the antenna apparatus as described above is
fabricated, and the performance is tested, a tendency
similar to that according to the eighth embodiment is
obtained.</p>
    <p num="0054">Although in the eighth embodiment, it is described
that the pad is formed in a rectangular shape, the pad
may be formed in another shape without being limited to
such rectangular shape.</p>
    <p num="0055">According to each of the above described
embodiments, a small sized chip antenna with its wide
bandwidth can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="0056">The width of the pad fixing the tip side of the
chip antenna is set to be twice or less of the meander
width of the meander antenna conductor, whereby the
wide bandwidth of the antenna can be achieved.
Further, since the tip side of the chip antenna is
loaded on the pad for increasing the bandwidth, it is
possible to further downsize the chip antenna and also 
reduce the size of a tip more than an edge of the
substrate ground pattern (a region free of the ground
pattern), thereby downsizing the substrate.</p>
    <p num="0057">The following inventions can be introduced from
each of the above-mentioned embodiments.</p>
    <p num="0058">The antenna apparatus according to the present
invention is characterized by comprising: a substrate;
a chip antenna mounted on the substrate; and a ground
pattern disposed on the substrate, at least a portion
on the side of a power supply terminal of an antenna
conductor in the chip antenna being overlapped with
said ground pattern. According to this antenna
apparatus, the substrate size can be reduced by the
overlapped size of the chip antenna and the ground
pattern. Further, the matching between the chip
antenna and the power supply line can be easily
achieved.</p>
    <p num="0059">As a chip antenna, there can be used: (1)
a meander antenna conductor provided on the surface
or inside of the dielectric chip; or (2) a helical
shaped conductor provided thereon or inside thereof.
The meander of the antenna conductor and/or helical
pitches may be uniform, and a coarse portion and
a dense portion may be present.</p>
    <p num="0060">It is preferable that the chip antenna has
a meander antenna conductor; the meander antenna
conductor 22 comprises a dense portion in meander
pitches and a coarse portion in meander pitches; and
part or all of the dense portion in meander pitches is
mounted on the substrate to overlap the ground pattern.
When the antenna conductor of the chip antenna is
formed in a helical shape, it is preferable that the
chip antenna is mounted on the substrate so that
helical pitches of the antenna conductor are dense at
the side of the power supply terminal and are coarse
at the tip side, and part or all of the dense portion
in helical pitches of this helical shaped antenna 
conductor is overlapped with the ground pattern.</p>
    <p num="0061">With such a configuration, adjustment for
obtaining matching can be made more easily.</p>
    <p num="0062">It is preferable that each of the above described
antenna apparatuses comprises the pad mounted on the
substrate and fixing the tip portion of the chip
antenna at a distant position from the edge of the
ground pattern and the pad is formed not to protruded
from the tip of the chip antenna to further downsize
the substrate.</p>
    <p num="0063">Another antenna apparatus according to the present
invention is characterized by comprising a chip
antenna, in which an antenna conductor has a meander
shape or helical shape, and said antenna conductor has
a dense portion and a coarse portion in meander pitches
or helical pitches. This makes it possible to ensure
that antenna downsizing and widening of the bandwidth
are compatible with each other.</p>
    <p num="0064">In the above described antenna apparatus, to
further widen a bandwidth, it is preferable that
a dense portion in meander pitches or helical pitches
are provided on a power supply terminal side of the
antenna conductor, and a coarse portion is provided at
a tip side of the antenna conductor.</p>
    <p num="0065">In addition, in the above each antenna apparatus,
to further downsize the antenna apparatus, it is
preferable that a number of turns at a dense portion
in meander pitches or helical pitches is larger than
a number of turns at a coarse portion.</p>
    <p num="0066">Another antenna apparatus according to the present
invention is an antenna apparatus in which a chip
antenna having a meander antenna conductor provided on
the surface or inside of the dielectric chip is mounted
on a substrate having a ground pattern provided on one
surface of the insulation substrate, and is characterized
in that the substrate has a pad for antenna
mounting at a position distant from an edge of a ground 
pattern on the insulation substrate, the chip antenna
is mounted so that one side having a power supply
terminal provided thereat is oriented to the ground
pattern side, and the other side is overlapped with
the pad, and the width of the pad is twice or less
of the size in the meander width direction of the
meander antenna conductor. In this manner, substrate
downsizing can be achieved. In addition, the pad width
is set to be twice or less of the size in the meander
width direction of the meander antenna conductor,
whereby a wider bandwidth can be achieved even by using
a small sized chip antenna.</p>
    <p num="0067">The "size in the meander width direction" used
here is equal to a distance between both ends (meander
width) in the meander width direction in the case of
a planar meander antenna conductor. However, this size
is equal to a distance between bent sections in the
case of a three-dimensional meander antenna conductor
bent so that both ends in the meander width direction
are close to each other, for example. The width of
the pad may be 0.5 to 1.75 times of the size in the
meander width direction, and more preferably, may be 1
to 1.5 times. The meander pitches are dense at the
side of the power supply terminal and are coarse at the
tip side. It is preferable that the antenna be mounted
so that part or all of the dense portion in meander
pitches is overlapped with the ground pattern.</p>
