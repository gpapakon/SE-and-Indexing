  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a process for manufacturing turbine
airfoil or blade components used in gas turbine engines. More specifically,
the present invention relates to a process for manufacturing turbine airfoils or
blades to limit the rubbing of any coatings that are applied to tips of the
turbine airfoils.</p>
    <p num="0002">Turbine blade materials, typically superalloys, achieve the desired high
temperature properties through directional or single crystal solidification as
well as by composition. However, one of the consequences of certain
alloying elements in composition is inadequate environmental resistance in a
gas turbine operating environment.</p>
    <p num="0003">Components such as turbine blades, operating in the gas path environment of
gas turbine engines are subjected to significant temperature extremes and
degradation by the oxidizing and corrosive environments caused by the hot
gases of combustion. Protective coating systems, such as environmental
coatings and thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems, are often applied to the
external surfaces of these components to protect the bare alloy from this
operating environment. In the case of TBC systems, the TBC system also
affords the opportunity to improve the efficiency of the engine by permitting
an increase in the operating temperatures of the engine. The environmental
coating systems are generally comprised of a metallic environmental coating
that serves as a bond coat applied to the structural component. When used in
a TBC system, an insulating ceramic layer is applied over the environmental
coating. Common bond coats or environmental coatings for turbine airfoils
and combustor components can be classified into two types, overlay coatings
and diffusion aluminide coatings.</p>
    <p num="0004">Overlay coatings such as MCrAlY type or NiAl based coatings can be applied
by physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes such as sputtering, cathodic
arc, electron beam, etc., or by plasma spray processes. Coating composition,
microstructure and thickness are controlled by the processing parameters.
Diffusion aluminide coatings are widely employed in the industry, and can be 
applied by a range of methods including pack cementation, above-the-pack
processing, vapor phase processing, chemical vapor deposition and slurry
coating processes. The thickness and aluminum content of the end product
coating can be controlled by varying the coating time, coating temperature,
the aluminum activity of the coating process and subsequent heat treatments.
Often, these coatings are enhanced by including noble metals and/or reactive
elements within the coating. To complete the TBC system, the ceramic top
coat, typically a yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), for rotating turbine airfoils is
preferably deposited by electron-beam PVD, although plasma spray
processes are widely used for stationary vane and combustor applications.
Improvements to TBC systems are constantly under development to permit
the airfoil system to which they are applied reach higher operating
temperatures or to have a longer operational life at current temperatures.</p>
    <p num="0005">These coating systems are often applied to fully machined blades that are
then assembled into the turbine disks, etc. and then into the final engine
assembly. Although machining operations are precise for each component,
within prescribed manufacturing tolerances, the stack-up of these
manufacturing tolerances in the assembled components of the final engine
assembly can result in significant variations. Because of these variations, the
tips of the blades often severely rub mating shroud materials during the initial
cycles of engine operation. This rubbing causes the removal of the
environmental coating and TBC system from the tip areas of the blades,
allowing direct exposure of the underlying less oxidation resistant superalloy
to hot oxidizing or corrosive gases. The consequence of the removal of the
environmental coating from the tip area is a more rapid oxidation of the
superalloy causing tip recession. An increase in the clearance between the
blade tip and the shroud can also result from these variations and is equally
undesirable, as these clearances cause significant loss in engine efficiency
and increase engine operating temperatures, further exacerbating the
problem. Although the coatings originally applied to these tip areas are
designed to withstand the hot oxidizing atmosphere, they are frequently
removed because of the imprecise control of the clearances. The removal or
partial removal of advanced TBC systems preclude taking full advantage of
the improvements afforded by the advanced TBC systems. </p>
    <p num="0006">U.S. Patent No. 5,191,711 to Vickers et al. discusses a fixture for placing and
holding of compressor blades or turbine blades in their normal "running
position." After the blades are placed in their "running position," the tips of the
blades can be machined to achieve a uniform tip clearance. Environmental
coatings and thermal barrier coating systems are not normally applied to
compressor hardware. Thus, it is not surprising that Vickers does not discuss
TBC or environmental coatings on the blade tips in general and does not
specifically discuss how to maintain the TBC or environmental coatings on the
blade tip during operation.</p>
    <p num="0007">Therefore, what is needed in the art is a process for sequencing the assembly
process for turbine blades or airfoils into the turbine engine to limit the extent
of tip rubbing and environmental coating removal that causes deterioration of
tips of TBC coated turbine engine airfoils during engine operation, while also
assuring that there is minimal clearance between the blades and shrouds that
could adversely affect engine efficiency.</p>
    <p num="0008">The present invention discloses several related techniques for processing
turbine airfoils or blades to achieve optimal tip performance and reduce the
wear or rubbing of thermal barrier coating (TBC) or environmental coatings
from the blade tip of the turbine airfoil.</p>
    <p num="0009">A first method of processing turbine blades to limit removal of applied
coatings from tips of the turbine blades includes assembling a plurality of
turbine blades into a turbine disk. The blades are dimensionally measured
and a set of turbine blades not having appropriate fit-up dimensions is
determined. The set of turbine blades not having appropriate fit-up
dimensions is then machined to achieve a predetermined fit-up dimension.
Afterwards, protective coatings (environmental coatings and TBC systems)
are applied to the turbine blades.</p>
    <p num="0010">A second method of processing turbine airfoils includes assembling a plurality
of turbine airfoils onto a turbine disk. Each turbine airfoil assembled on the
turbine disk is then measured. The turbine airfoils are then processed as
required, using the measurement of each turbine airfoil, to have a length less
than that required for appropriate fit-up dimensions. Finally, protective 
coatings (environmental coatings and TBC systems) are applied to the turbine
airfoils in amounts sufficient to achieve the appropriate fit-up dimensions for
each turbine airfoil.</p>
    <p num="0011">A third method of processing turbine blades for appropriate fit-up dimensions
includes applying protective coatings to a plurality of turbine blades. The
coated turbine blades are then assembled onto a turbine disk. The turbine
disk is then assembled into a turbine engine and the turbine engine is run with
the blades assembled on the turbine disk. Alternatively, a set of coated
turbine blades not having appropriate fit-up dimensions is then determined.
The set of coated turbine blades not having appropriate fit-up dimensions
have material removed to achieve appropriate fit-up dimensions. Finally, a
slurry or other coating is applied to the turbine blade to restore any protective
coatings that may have been removed.</p>
    <p num="0012">The present invention can significantly improve the performance of blade tips
by assuring not only proper fit-up of the blade to rotor but also that
appropriate coatings are on the proper fitting blade. Consequently, this
improvement in blade tip performance can extend the service intervals for
engines operating with these blade tips because a high percentage of shop
visits are dictated by performance loss and increase in engine gas
temperatures due to tip recession that occurs after protective coatings are lost
due to early engine excursions. In addition, this improvement in blade tip
performance can extend the time period of adequate engine efficiency and
improve the repairability of airfoils with TBC bond coats.</p>
    <p num="0013">One advantage of the present invention is that it provides extended
performance capabilities for engines using environmental coatings on turbine
airfoils. Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides
improved repairability of airfoils following engine use. Still another advantage
of the present invention is that existing processes can be used to achieve
these improvements. A further advantage of the present invention is that the
entire benefit resulting from advanced TBC systems can be utilized after initial
engine cycling and break-in. An additional advantage of the present invention
is that improved control of fit-up results in improved engine performance from
less shroud abrasion and a better seal between the blade tip and the shroud. </p>

    <p num="0016">The present invention provides improved techniques for manufacturing or
processing turbine blades used in gas turbine engines. A representative
turbine blade or airfoil 10 with a corresponding blade tip or squealer tip 12 is
illustrated in Figure 1.</p>
    <p num="0017">In a first embodiment of the present invention, the turbine blades or airfoils 10
are cast and machined to within manufacturing tolerances using conventional
procedures well known in the art. Substrate materials often used in turbine
blades or airfoils for aircraft engines may include nickel based superalloys.
The alloys may be cast or wrought superalloys. Examples of airfoil substrates
are GTD-111, GTD-222, Rene 80, Rene 41, Rene 125, Rene 77, Rene 142,
Rene N4, Rene N5, Rene N6, Inconel 706, and Inconel 718.</p>
    <p num="0018">Next, as shown in Figure 2, the blades 10 are assembled into corresponding
dovetail slots 22 on a turbine disk 20. The blades 10 assembled into the
turbine disk 20 are measured for tip clearances using conventional 
procedures well known in the art. The blades 10 that do not have adequate
tip clearance are labeled and recorded for subsequent machining with
traceability to their dovetail slot position in the turbine disk 20.</p>
    <p num="0019">Figure 7 illustrates diagrammatically adequate tip clearance for the turbine
blades 10. Turbine blades 10 are assembled into the turbine disk 20 and
assembled into an engine where they are surrounded by a shroud 24 which
forms the outer flow path boundary. The distance A between the shroud 24
and the blade tip 12 is the distance that represents the predetermined
adequate clearance between the blade 10 and the shroud 24 in a cold
engine. The distance A is preferably a positive non-zero value when the gas
turbine engine is cold but is made as small as possible for optimal gas turbine
engine performance. The distance A is preferably defined as a range of
values to account for manufacturing tolerances in the manufacturing
specifications of various features of the gas turbine engine components, e.g.
the blade 10, the turbine disk 20 and the shroud 24. However, in the
situations where the distance A is less than a predetermined adequate tip
clearance, or zero, the blade tip 12 will be in frictional contact with the shroud
24 when the engine is at operating temperatures. This situation is the
situation described above that leads to the rubbing or wear of TBC or
environmental coatings from the blade tip 12 due to frictional contact with the
shroud 24.</p>
    <p num="0020">Figures 3A-3C illustrate schematically the process used in the first
embodiment of the present invention. Figure 3A illustrates schematically a
blade 30 that has been measured and recorded as not having adequate tip
clearance, i.e. blade 30 is too long. The blade 30 in Figure 3A is indicated as
having a length of I<sub>B</sub>+x, where I<sub>B</sub> is the predetermined length for a blade 10
assembled in turbine disk 20 to have an adequate tip clearance and x is a
length in excess of the predetermined length for the blade 10. Thus, if a
blade of length I<sub>B</sub>+x is coated and placed into service in an engine, the
protective coatings will quickly be removed from the tip. Further, the length of
I<sub>B</sub> is determined in view of any subsequent application of any oxidation-resistant
or protective coating to blade 10. In other words, the length of I<sub>B</sub> is
determined to be of sufficient length to permit the application of protective 
coatings of predetermined thickness to blade 10 and still permit blade 10,
after receiving the TBC coating system, to maintain an adequate tip
clearance.</p>
    <p num="0021">Next, all the blades 10 are removed from the turbine disk 20. Simultaneously,
with the removal of each blade 10 from the turbine disk 20, the location of the
blade 10 in the turbine disk 20 is recorded. The blades 10 that were
previously labeled and recorded as not having adequate tip clearance will be
machined to achieve an adequate tip clearance control. The machining of the
blade tips 12 can be accomplished by match grinding, however, the material
can be removed from the blade tips 12 by other processes. Each blade 10 is
then reassembled into the same dovetail slot 22 in the turbine disk 20 at the
same position and orientation as originally assembled using the information
recorded when the blades 10 were removed.</p>
    <p num="0022">To further illustrate the disassembly and re-assembly of blades 10 from
turbine disk 20, Figure 6 shows a partial cross-section of turbine disk 20 with
three dovetail slots 60-64 and three blades 70-74 assembled in the slots. As
described above, the blades 70-74 would be measured to determine those
blades 70-74 that do not have adequate tip clearance. Next, those blades
that do not have adequate tip clearance are labeled, and their measured
dimensions recorded. The blades 70-74 are then disassembled from the
turbine disk 20 for the machining of the blades 70-74 that do not have
adequate tip clearance. To begin disassembly, blade 70 is removed from
dovetail slot 60, information matching each blade 70 to a respective dovetail
slot 60 is recorded. This disassembly process is then repeated for blades 72,
74, wherein similar information for blades 72, 74 and their respective dovetail
slots 62, 64 is recorded. After machining is performed on the blades 70-74
having inadequate tip clearances based on the recorded measured
dimensions, the preselected coating system is applied to a preselected
thickness consistent with required tip clearances and the re-assembly process
is started. In the re-assembly process, blade 70 is reassembled into dovetail
slot 60, blade 72 is reassembled into dovetail slot 62 and blade 74 is
reassembled into dovetail slot 64, so that the machined blades 70-74 are in 
the same dovetail slots 60-64 that the blades 70-74 were originally in when
blades 70-74 were measured for tip clearance.</p>
    <p num="0023">Figure 3B illustrates schematically that blade 30 shown in Figure 3A has been
machined to have an adequate tip clearance prior to coating. The blade 30 in
Figure 3B is indicated as having a length of I<sub>B</sub>, where I<sub>B</sub> is the predetermined
length for a blade 10 assembled in turbine disk 20 to have an adequate tip
clearance. It will also be understood by those skilled in the art that length I<sub>B</sub> is
a toleranced dimension, that is, it falls within predetermined tolerance limits
after x amount of material has been removed from blade 30 of Figure 3A.</p>
    <p num="0024">Alternatively, after the blades 10 that do not have adequate tip clearance are
machined and all blades 10 reassembled on the turbine disk 20, any required
oxidation-resistant or protective coatings can be applied as assembled. The
oxidation-resistant or protective coatings include environmental (bond)
coatings and TBC systems. The re-assembly of the blades 10 into their
original dovetail slots 22 on the turbine disk 20 where the blades 10 were
originally measured from results in all the blades 10 having adequate tip
clearance. If the blades 10 are not reassembled into their original dovetail
slots 22 on the turbine disk 20, several of the blades 10 may not have
adequate tip clearance control due to the blades 10 being machined from
measurements based on different datum or reference points, each dovetail
slot 22 being a unique datum. Thus, a blade 10 assembled in a different
dovetail slot 22 can have different clearances due to tolerance stack-up
considerations.</p>
    <p num="0025">In another embodiment, blades 10 can remain assembled in the turbine disk
20. Only those blades 10 that do not have adequate tip clearance control will
have their corresponding blade tips 12 machined to achieve adequate tip
clearance control. In this embodiment, the preferred technique for machining
the blades 10 is grinding, however other techniques can be used. The blades
10 can then be removed for application of the environmental coating after
recording the location of each blade on the turbine disk or the blades 10 can
receive the environmental coating in-situ, that is, while assembled in the
turbine disk 20. </p>
    <p num="0026">The required areas of the airfoils 10 are coated with an environmental or bond
coating using standard production methods well known in the art. Bond coats
and overlay layers are usually metallic compositions, including aluminides of
platinum, nickel and combinations thereof, aluminum, and MCrAIX where M is
an element selected from the group consisting of nickel, iron, cobalt and
combinations thereof and X is an element selected from the group consisting
of yttrium, zirconium and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment of
the present invention, the bond coats and overlay layers have a NiAl based
composition (preferably a beta phase NiAl based composition). The areas of
the airfoil 10 that can receive an environmental coating include the platform
15 and the areas 17 below platform 15 (see Figure 1) through to the tip 12 of
the airfoil 10. In addition, selected areas of the airfoil 10, usually the tip 12
and regions in proximity to the tip 12, are coated with a thermal barrier coating
(TBC) using standard production methods well known in the art.</p>
    <p num="0027">Figure 3C illustrates schematically that blade 30 shown in Figure 3B has
received an environmental coating 32 and a TBC coating 34. The
environmental coating 32 and TBC coating 34 can preferably be applied to
the blade 30 when blade 30 is disassembled from the turbine disk. The blade
30 in Figure 3C is indicated as having a length of I<sub>C</sub>, where I<sub>C</sub> is the
predetermined length for a blade 10 with TBC and environmental coating
assembled in turbine disk 20 to have an adequate tip clearance.</p>
    <p num="0028">In a second embodiment of the present invention, the turbine blades or
airfoils 10 are again cast and machined to within manufacturing tolerances
using conventional procedures well known in the art. The blades 10 are also
assembled into dovetail slots 22 on the turbine disk 20 as in the first
embodiment. Next, each assembled blade 10 is measured using
conventional procedures well known in the art. The measurement of each
assembled blade 10 is recorded.</p>
    <p num="0029">Figures 4A-4C illustrate schematically the process used in the second
embodiment of the present invention. Figure 4A illustrates schematically a
blade 40 having been measured to determine its length. The blade 40 shown
in Figure 4A is indicated as having a length of I<sub>X</sub>, where I<sub>X</sub> is the measured 
length for a blade 10 assembled in turbine disk 20. The length of I<sub>X</sub> can either
be larger or smaller than the length of I<sub>B</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0030">After each blade 10 is measured, each blade tip 12 is then machined,
preferably by rotor grinding, using the measurement for each blade 10
previously recorded so as to be slightly shorter than the predetermined
adequate tip clearance control. However, blades 10 that are already shorter
than the predetermined adequate tip clearance control may not require
machining. The blades 10 are preferably machined to be 0.002-0.010 inches
shorter than required for adequate tip clearance.</p>
    <p num="0031">Figure 4B illustrates schematically that blade 40 shown in Figure 4A has been
machined to have a length shorter than required for adequate tip clearance.
The blade 40 in Figure 4B is indicated as having a length of I<sub>B</sub>-x, where I<sub>B</sub> is
the predetermined length for a blade 10 assembled in turbine disk 20 to have
an adequate tip clearance and x is an unknown length about 0.002-0.010
inches in length. That is, the blade 40 is undersized by about 0.002-0.010
inches.</p>
    <p num="0032">After the blades 10 have been machined to have a length shorter than
required for adequate tip clearance, the blade tips 12 are then built up to have
adequate tip clearance control by applying extra protective coatings. The
extra coatings applied to the blade tips 12 are preferably extra amounts of the
environmental coatings and TBC, typically applied to the blade tips 12. The
environmental coatings and TBC are applied using conventional procedures
well known in the art. The thickness of the environmental coating and TBC
applied to the blade tip 12 is controlled by varying the processing parameters
controls. These extra coatings will have improved environmental resistance
over the base material. Some techniques used to apply the coatings include,
but are not limited to, thermal spray, welding or electroplating. In the case
where only an environmental coating is applied, subsequent machining may
be necessary after application of the environmental coating to reshape areas
of the blade tip 12 and achieve adequate tip clearance. An advantage of this
specific embodiment is that an additional environmental coating applied to
blade 40 is available to provide protection to the blade 40 even if an
unexpected power excursion occurs during engine operation that causes an 
unplanned and unexpected rub resulting in material loss between lengths I<sub>B</sub>
and I<sub>B</sub>-x.</p>
    <p num="0033">In another embodiment, the blades 10 are actually cast and machined to be
slightly shorter than standard manufacturing tolerances, so that when the
blades 10 are assembled into the turbine disk 20, the blade tips 12 are 0.002-0.010
inches shorter than standard tip clearances (see Figure 4B). The
blades 10 are then assembled into dovetail slots 22 of a turbine disk 20.
Each blade tip 12 is then measured to confirm that it is 0.002-0.010 inches
shorter than standard tip clearance. Those blade tips 12 that are not 0.002-0.010
inches shorter than standard tip clearance can be machined, preferably
rotor ground, to be 0.002-0.010 inches shorter than standard tip clearance.
The blade tips 12 then receive the extra coatings as described above to
obtain adequate tip clearance.</p>
    <p num="0034">Figure 4C illustrates schematically that blade 40 shown in Figure 4B has
received an environmental coating 32 and a TBC 34. The blade 40 in Figure
4C is indicated as having a length of I<sub>C</sub>, where I<sub>C</sub> is the predetermined length
for a blade 10 with environmental and TBC coatings assembled in turbine
disk 20 to have an adequate tip clearance.</p>
    <p num="0035">In a third embodiment of the present invention, the turbine blades or airfoils
10 are again cast and machined to within manufacturing tolerances using
conventional procedures well known in the art. Environmental and TBC
coatings are applied to the blades 10 using standard production methods well
known in the art. The turbine blades 10 are assembled into dovetail slots 22
in the turbine disk 20. The coated turbine blades 10 assembled in the turbine
disk 20 are then measured for adequate tip clearance using standard
techniques well known in the art.</p>
    <p num="0036">Figures 5A-5C illustrate schematically the process used in the third
embodiment of the present invention. Figure 5A illustrates schematically a
blade 50 that has been coated with an environmental coating 32 and TBC
system 34 and measured to determine its length. The blade 50 shown in
Figure 5A is indicated as having a length of I<sub>X</sub>, where I<sub>X</sub> is the measured 
length for a coated blade 10 assembled in turbine disk 20. The length of I<sub>X</sub>
can either be larger or smaller than the required length of I<sub>C</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0037">The coated blades 10 that are measured as not having adequate tip
clearance are then machined, preferably rotor ground, to achieve adequate
tip clearance. Preferably, after completion of the machining, the blade tips 12
should be very slightly shorter than necessary for adequate tip clearance.
The machining of the blades 10 can remove some or all of any TBC coating
that has been applied to the blade 10. In addition, the machining may also
remove some of the environmental coating and even possibly some of the
base material of the blade 10. Removal of material from the blades 10 also
can be accomplished by cycling the engine through engine transients. When
engine cycling is used to remove material from the blades 10, portions of the
blade 10 can have TBC coating and environmental coating removed while
other portions of the blade 10 do not have TBC coating and environmental
coating removed. In other words, once a blade 10 has completed an engine
cycle, portions of the blade 10 can have the TBC coating and environmental
coatings removed, while the TBC coating and environmental coating on other
portions of the blade 10 can be unaffected.</p>
    <p num="0038">Figure 5B illustrates schematically that blade 50 shown in Figure 5A has had
material removed so that it has a length shorter than required for adequate tip
clearance. The blade 50 in Figure 5B is indicated as having a length of I<sub>C</sub>-x,
where I<sub>C</sub> is the predetermined length for a blade 10 with environmental and
TBC systems assembled in turbine disk 20 to have an adequate tip clearance
and x is a length between about 0.002-0.010 inches.</p>
    <p num="0039">To achieve adequate tip clearance control and to restore at least a protective
environmental coating for each of the blades 10, a slurry containing some
quantity of aluminum or aluminum and reactive elements can then be applied
to affected blade tips 12. The blade tip 12 is then heated to an elevated
temperature using standard techniques to permit diffusion of the aluminum
into the blade tip 12 to enhance the environmental resistance of the blade tip
12 and provide a diffusion coating. However, in a preferred embodiment of
the present invention, the slurry can contain platinum or more preferably,
platinum and reactive elements such as hafnium, zirconium and yttrium, 
which would then be diffused into the blade tip 12 on heating of the blade tip
12 to form a diffusion coating. The slurry can be applied to those portions of
the blade 10 that have TBC coating and/or environmental coating removed by
cycling the engine and to any coatings. The slurry can also be applied to
those portions of the blade 10 that still have some TBC coating or
environmental coating present on the blade tip 12 after the blade 10 has
completed an engine cycle. It is also possible to apply an oxidation resistant
additive overlay coating, e.g. a NiAl based composition or MCrAIX, to that
area by thermal spray processes such as hyper-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF), low
pressure plasma spray (LPPS), air plasma spray (APS), or by physical vapor
deposition processes such as electron beam (EB-PVD), cathodic arc and
sputtering.</p>
    <p num="0040">Figure 5C illustrates schematically that blade 50 shown in Figure 5B has
received a slurry coating 36 in addition to an environmental coating 32. The
blade 50 in Figure 5C is indicated as having a length of I<sub>C</sub>, where I<sub>C</sub> is the
predetermined length for a coated blade 10 assembled in turbine disk 20 to
have an adequate tip clearance.</p>
    <p num="0041">It is to be understood that the environmental coatings and TBC illustrated only
on the blade tip 12 in Figures 3C, 4C and 5A-5C are applied to other areas of
the turbine blade as required and in accordance with coating practices well
known in the art.</p>
