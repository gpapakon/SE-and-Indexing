    <p>A device for tensioning web, such as a plastics web
(21) dispensed from a shuttle (3) in a wrapping machine
(1), is disclosed. The wrapping machine (1) usually
includes an endless track (2) positioned about an object
(5) to be wrapped and the shuttle (3) travels on the
endless track (2), dispensing the web (21) as it goes. The
rate at which web is dispensed varies as the shuttle (3)
progresses around the track (2) and is dependent upon the
shape of the track and the shape of the object to be
wrapped. The web tensioning device (22) attempts to
maintain a constant tension in the web (21) and includes a
pair of rollers (23,24) covered with resilient material.
The rollers (23,24) are urged together to form a nip (29)
with the resilient covering of the rollers compressed in
the nip. The web (21) is fed between the nip (29) of the
rollers (23,24).

  </abstract>
  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">This invention relates to web tensioning devices for
machines which apply a generally helical winding of a
wrapping web by using a shuttle which contains a supply of
the wrapping web and which moves around a track defining a
closed path. The invention particularly relates to axial
winding of a wrapping web in which the closed path of the
track passes through an opening of an object to be wrapped.</p>
    <p num="0002">In machines of the type described above, relative
movement is established between the object to be wrapped
and the closed path around which the shuttle moves. Such
machines can be used to apply a wrapping to elongate
articles or bundles of elongate articles and especially can
be used for wrapping annular or toroidal products such as
steel coils. In this case the track is either formed in two
halves as described in US-A-5755083 or includes a gate as
shown in US-A-5282347 to enable the coil to be positioned
such that the track goes through the centre of the coil and
around the outside of the coil. The track is usually
arranged to be fixed in space and the coil arranged to be
rotated about its axis so that, as the shuttle moves around
the track, axial wrapping takes place so that a generally
helical winding of packaging web is applied around the
outside of the annular coil and through its centre
aperture.</p>
    <p num="0003">The rate of removal of the web from the shuttle varies
as the shuttle moves around the track and depends upon the
size of the object. Again taking the case of steel coils,
these usually have a standard centre aperture but the width
of the steel sheet and the length of the sheet (and
therefore the diameter of the coil) often vary from coil to
coil and thus the generally rectangular cross-section of
the coil being wrapped varies from coil to coil. To
accommodate such variations most shuttles include some form
of brake mechanism to brake the unwinding of the web supply
reel and an accumulator to hold a supply of web to allow it 
to be taken at an irregular rate. To enable such shuttles
to fit through the centre of a steel coil the shuttle and
track must be made as small as reasonable and it would be
desirable to avoid an accumulator on the shuttle. Some
attempts have been made to do this in, for example, US-A-5829234
in which the shape of the track is varied to
provide a substantially uniform rate of removal of the web
from the shuttle and so avoid the need for an accumulator
on the shuttle.</p>
    <p num="0004">When the web is tensioned by using a simple reel brake
then the tension in the web varies with the radius of the
supply reel and therefore the tension in the wrapping
varies as the web is dispensed from the supply reel. It has
been proposed in EP-A-0936141 to provide a variable brake
for the supply reel, a tension sensor for sensing the
tension in the web downstream from the supply reel and,
feedback means to control the supply reel brake in response
to the sensed tension to maintain the tension substantially
constant. Similar feedback arrangements are used on large
scale fixed web feeding systems used with printing presses
and film reeling machines, but it is difficult to use such
techniques in a shuttle moving around a closed path.
Typically, the power to drive a shuttle round such a closed
path is taken from wiper contacts on the shuttle which
engage conductor rails located around the track. The use of
sophisticated control circuitry relying on such wiper
contacts is difficult to implement in practice.</p>
    <p num="0005">According to a first aspect of this invention a web
tensioning device for a shuttle applying a generally
helical winding includes a pair of substantially rigid
rollers covered with resilient material and urged against
one another to form a nip with their resilient covering
compressed in the nip and with the web being fed between
the nip of the rollers.</p>
    <p num="0006">We have found that such a simple arrangement provides
a substantially constant tension in the wrapping web that
does not vary with the radius of the supply reel or vary 
significantly with the rate of unreeling of the wrapping
web. This arrangement certainly provides results which are
very much better than those of a simple supply reel brake
and is much easier and cheaper to implement than the
systems involving a variable braking effort on the supply
reel.</p>
    <p num="0007">Such web tensioning devices can be used with a machine
as described in EP-A-0936141 where the shape of the track
is varied to provide a substantially constant rate of
unreeling of the wrapping web and thus not require an
associated web accumulator. However, it is preferred that
the shuttle also includes a web accumulator downstream of
the web tensioning device to enable the shuttle to cope
with changes in the instantaneous rate of web supply from
it.</p>
    <p num="0008">Preferably, the rollers have a hollow or solid steel
core with a covering of rubber or rubber-like elastomeric
material, the rubber or rubber-like elastomeric material
may be a vulcanised natural or synthetic rubber or a
thermoplastic elastomer such as polyurethane. Preferably,
the resilient covering is heat resistant since substantial
quantities of heat can build up in the rollers at high web
throughput rates. Preferably, the covering has a Shore
hardness of between 70 and 75 and a specific gravity of
between 1.14 and 1.20. The core of the rollers can have a
diameter from between 25 to 100 mm and a covering thickness
in a range of 8 to 4 mm, respectively.</p>
    <p num="0009">Preferably, the rollers are mounted in a box frame
construction consisting of two side plates and stretchers
which form the body of the shuttle, the journal bearings
for one of the rollers being mounted on slides in the side
plates and including adjusters such as jack-screws to urge
the one roll towards the other. Preferably, a web supply
roll on a web supply reel is urged against the up-stream
roller or the up-stream roller is urged against the web
supply roll to control the unwinding of the web from the
roll and it does not allow the supply roll to freewheel. </p>
    <p num="0010">In a second aspect, the invention consists in a
shuttle for carrying a web material adapted to be applied
in a generally helical winding, the shuttle including a web
tensioning device according to the first aspect.</p>
    <p num="0011">In a third aspect, the invention consists in wrapping
apparatus for applying a wrapping web to an article, the
wrapping apparatus including an endless track arranged
about the article to be wrapped and upon which at least one
shuttle according to the second aspect travels.</p>
    <p num="0012">A particular example of a web tensioning device in
accordance with this invention will now be described with
reference to the accompanying drawings; in which:-
<sl><li>Figure 1 is a perspective view of a web tensioning
device according to the present invention in use about a
wrapping web,</li><li>Figure 2 is a cross-sectional side elevation of a
shuttle including the web tensioning device of Figure 1,
and</li><li>Figure 3 is a side elevation of a wrapping apparatus
for use in wrapping coils of steel which includes the
shuttle of Figure 2.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0013">With reference initially to Figure 3, a wrapping
apparatus 1 is shown comprising an endless looped track 2
about which a wrapping shuttle 3 travels. An endless rack
8 is provided on the inner surface of the endless track 2.
A section 4 of the track is movable away from the remainder
of the track in order to allow an article to be wrapped,
for example a coil 5 of sheet steel, to be positioned for
wrapping and also to allow for removal or replacement of
the wrapping shuttle 3. The coil 5 is provided on a movable
platform 6 for positioning the coil with its central hole
surrounding a section of the track 2 and also for rotating
the coil during wrapping. The height of the looped track 2
is also adjustable on a columnar support 7 to cater for
different sized coils.</p>
    <p num="0014">The wrapping apparatus of Figure 3 is merely one
example of a wrapping apparatus suitable for use with the 
web tensioning device according to the present invention
which is described below. Other types of wrapping apparatus
could alternatively incorporate the present web tensioning
device, such as that disclosed in US-A-5755083 in which the
endless track is formed in two symmetrical "U" shaped parts
which are movable towards and away from each other.
Furthermore, while the wrapping apparatus is shown in use
wrapping a coil of sheet steel, other articles not having
a central opening, such as bundles of pipes, timber or
metal extrusions may just as easily be wrapped.</p>
    <p num="0015">With reference now in particular to Figure 2, the
workings of a particular embodiment of shuttle 3 are shown.
The shuttle 3 similar to that described in, for example US-A-5755083,
including a roll 10 of wrapping medium 21 such
as a roll of plastics stretch web or film mounted on a
supply reel 9. More preferably, the wrapping medium
comprises a film such as that sold under the Trade Mark
VALCROSS by Illinois Tool Works Inc. which is an inherently
substantially non-stretchable cross-laminated strength
film.</p>
    <p num="0016">The roll 10 of wrapping medium 21 protrudes from one
end of a shuttle body 11 comprising a box frame having two
side plates separated by stretchers. An electric motor 12
is mounted within the shuttle to drive a pinion 13 engaged
with the rack 8. The motor 12 may be energised by way of
wiper contacts on the shuttle contacting rigid electric
supply conductors positioned within the wrapping apparatus,
beneath the surface of and around the perimeter of track 2.
Freewheeling side wheels 14 to 17 maintain the shuttle on
the track.</p>
    <p num="0017">An accumulator 18 may be provided within the shuttle
3 to effectively "store" excess wrapping medium 21 within
the shuttle should the rate at which it is fed from the
roll 10 temporarily be greater than the rate at which it is
applied around the article being wrapped. The accumulator
comprises an array of rollers, some of which (19, 20) are
movable under spring tension as is conventionally known. 
However, as previously mentioned, the accumulator 18 is not
essential to the operation of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="0018">A web tensioning device 22 is also included within the
shuttle 3. The tensioning device is shown out of the
shuttle in Figure 1 for clarity and includes a pair of
substantially rigid rollers 23 and 24. The ends of rollers
23 and 24 are mounted in cassette holders 25 and 26 so that
the axes of the rollers are parallel. Roller 23 is
rotatable within roller bearings in cassette holders 25 and
26 but is not otherwise movable with respect to the
cassette holders. Roller bearings also rotatably support
roller 24 within cassettes 25 and 26 however the roller
bearings are mounted in a slide channel 27 so that the axis
of roller 24 may be moved towards or away from the axis of
roller 23. Adjustment means such as jack screws 28 are
provided in the free ends of the cassette holders to allow
user adjustment of the distance between the axes of rollers
23 and 24.</p>
    <p num="0019">The wrapping medium 21 is wound under roller 23,
between rollers 23 and 24 and then on to the accumulator 18
or out of the shuttle and directly on to the article to be
wrapped. The rollers 23 and 24 may be, for example, 260mm
in length and 45mm in diameter including an outer
approximately 5mm coating of natural rubber material over
a hollow or solid steel core. Accordingly, roller 24 may be
adjusted so that its coated surface is in contact with the
covered surface of roller 23, through the wrapping medium
21. The two coatings are then deformed, thereby providing
a nip 29 through which the wrapping medium 21 is dispensed.
It is anticipated that the rollers will be required to
endure significant heat build up. The thickness of the
roller outer covering of resilient material could be
decreased provided that the diameter of the roller overall
was increased to aid in dissipation of the built up heat.</p>
    <p num="0020">Once the free end of wrapping medium 21 has been
secured to an article to be wrapped, subsequent movement of
the shuttle around the track causes wrapping medium to be 
drawn off the roll 10. The nip 29 creates a rolling
resistance resulting in tension in the dispensed wrapping
material. Adjustment of the jack screws 28 allows this
tension in the wrapping medium to be controlled to suit a
variety of wrapping medium specifications. In order to
avoid the roll 10 freewheeling and unwinding, a slight drag
would desirably be provided on the supply reel 9. This
could be provided by positioning roller 23 so that its
surface contacts the undispensed surface of wrapping medium
on roll 10.</p>
