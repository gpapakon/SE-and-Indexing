      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <heading>1. Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory and its production process, and more particularly,
the invention relates to a semiconductor memory provided
with a memory transistor having a charge storage layer and a
control gate, and its production process.</p>
    <heading>2. Description of Related Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">As a memory cell of an EEPROM, is known a device of
a MOS transistor structure having a charge storage layer and
a control gate in a gate portion, in which an electric charge is
injected into and released from the charge storage layer by
use of a tunnel current. In this memory cell, data "0" and
"1" are stored as changes in a threshold voltage by the state
of the charge in the charge storage layer. For example, in
the case of an n-channel memory cell using a floating gate as
the charge storage layer, when a source/drain diffusion layer
and a substrate are grounded and a high positive voltage is 
applied to the control gate, electrons are injected from the
substrate into the floating gate by a tunnel current. This
injection of electrons shifts the threshold voltage of the
memory cell toward positive. When the control gate is
grounded and a high positive voltage is applied to the
source/drain diffusion layer or the substrate, electrons are
released from the floating gate to the substrate by the tunnel
current. This release of electrons shifts the threshold
voltage of the memory cell toward negative.</p>
    <p num="0003">In the above-described operation, a relationship of
capacity coupling between the floating gate and the control
gate with capacity coupling between the floating gate and the
substrate plays an important role in effective injection and
release of electrons, i.e., effective writing and erasure. That
is, the larger the capacity between the floating gate and the
control gate, the more effectively the potential of the control
gate can be transmitted to the floating gate and the easier the
writing and erasure become.</p>
    <p num="0004">With recent development in semiconductor
technology, especially, in micro-patterning techniques, the
size reduction and the capacity increase of memory cells of
EEPROM are rapidly progressing. Accordingly, it is
important how large capacity can be ensured between the
floating gate and the control gate.</p>
    <p num="0005">For increasing the capacity between the floating gate
and the control gate, it is necessary to thin a gate insulating
film therebetween, to increase the dielectric constant of the
gate insulating film or to enlarge an area where the floating
gate opposes the control gate. </p>
    <p num="0006">However, the thinning of the gate insulating film is
limited in view of reliability of memory cells. For increasing
the dielectric constant of the gate insulating film, a silicon
nitride film is used as the gate insulating film instead of a
silicon oxide film. This is also questionable in view of
reliability and is not practical.</p>
    <p num="0007">Therefore, in order to ensure a sufficient capacity
between the floating gate and the control gate, it is necessary
to set a sufficient overlap area therebetween. This is,
however, contradictory to the size reduction of memory cells
and the capacity increase of EEPROM.</p>
    <p num="0008">In an EEPROM disclosed by Japanese Patent
No.2877462, memory transistors are formed by use of
sidewalls of a plurality of pillar-form semiconductor layers
arranged in matrix on a semiconductor substrate, the
pillar-form semiconductor layers being separated by trenches
in a lattice form. A memory transistor is composed of a
drain diffusion layer formed on the top of each pillar-form
semiconductor layer, a common source diffusion layer formed
at the bottom of the trenches, and a charge storage layer and
a control gate which are around all the periphery of the
sidewall of the pillar-form semiconductor layer. The control
gate is provided continuously for a plurality of pillar-form
semiconductor layers lined in one direction so as to form a
control gate line, and a bit line is connected to drain diffusion
layers of a plurality of memory transistors lined in a direction
crossing the control gate line. The above-described charge
storage layer and the control gate are formed in a lower part
of the pillar-form semiconductor layer. In a one 
transistor/one cell structure, if a memory transistor is
over-erased, i.e., a reading potential is 0 V and the threshold
is negative, a cell current flows in the memory cell even if it is
not selected. To surely prevent this inconvenience, a
selection gate transistor is provided above the memory
transistor. The selection gate transistor has a gate electrode
formed to surround at least a part of the periphery of the
pillar-form island semiconductor layer in an upper part of the
pillar-form semiconductor layer.</p>
    <p num="0009">The prior-art EEPROM memory cell has the charge
storage layer and the control gate which are formed by use of
the sidewall of the island-like semiconductor layer to
surround the pillar-form semiconductor layer. With this
construction, a sufficiently large capacity can be ensured
between the charge storage layer and the control gate with a
small area occupied. The drain regions of the memory cells
connected to the bit lines are formed on the top of the
pillar-form semiconductor layers and completely insulated
from each other by the trenches. A device isolation region
can further be decreased and the memory cells are reduced in
size. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain a mass-storage
EEPROM with memory cells which provide excellent writing
and erasing efficiency.</p>
    <p num="0010">Hereinafter, explanation is given of a prior-art
EEPROM with reference to figures. Fig. 1651 is a plan view
of the prior-art EEPROM, and Figs. 1652(a) and 1652(b) are
sectional views taken on lines A-A' and B-B', respectively, in
Fig. 1651.</p>
    <p num="0011">In Fig. 1651, pillar-form silicon semiconductor layers 
2 are columnar, that is, the top thereof is circular. However,
the shape of the pillar-form silicon semiconductor layers need
not be columnar. In the plan view of Fig. 1651, selection
gate lines formed by continuing the gate electrodes of the
selection gate transistors are not shown for avoiding
complexity of the figure.</p>
    <p num="0012">In the prior art, is used a P-type silicon substrate 1,
on which a plurality of pillar-form P-type silicon layers 2 are
arranged in matrix. The pillar-form P-type silicon layers 2
are separated by trenches 3 in a lattice form and functions as
memory cell regions. Drain diffusion layers 10 are formed on
the top of the silicon layers 2, common source diffusion layers
9 are formed at the bottom of the trenches 3, and oxide films
4 are buried at the bottom of the trenches 3. Floating gates
6 are formed in a lower part of the pillar-form silicon layers 2
with intervention of tunnel oxide films 5 so as to surround
the pillar-form silicon layers 2. Outside the floating gates 6,
control gates 8 are formed with intervention of interlayer
insulating films 7. Thus memory transistors are formed.
Here, as shown in Figs. 1651 and 1652(b), the control gates 8
are provided continuously for a plurality of memory cells in
one direction so as to form control gate lines (CG1, CG2, ...).
Gate electrodes 32 are provided around an upper part of the
pillar-form silicon layers 2 with intervention of gate oxide
films 31 to form the selection gate transistors, like the
memory transistors. The gate electrodes 32 of the selection
gate transistors, like the control gates 8 of the memory cells,
are provided continuously in the same direction as that of the
control gates 8 of the memory cells so as to form selection 
gate lines, i.e., word lines WL (WL1, WL2, ...).</p>
    <p num="0013">Thus, the memory transistors and the selection gate
transistors are buried in the trenches in a stacked state.
The control gate lines leave end portions as contact portions
14 on the surface of silicon layers, and the selection gate
lines leaves contact portions 15 on silicon layers on an end
opposite to the contact portions 14 of the control gates. Al
wires 13 and 16 to be control gate lines CG and the word
lines WL, respectively, are contacted to the contact portions
14 and 15, respectively.</p>
    <p num="0014">At the bottom of the trenches 3, common source
diffusion layers 9 of the memory cells are formed, and on the
top of the pillar-form silicon layers 2, drain diffusion layers
10 are formed for every memory cell. The resulting substrate
with the thus formed memory cells is covered with a CVD
oxide film 11, where contact holes are opened. Al wires 12
are provided which are to be bit lines BL (BL1, BL2, ...) which
connects the drain diffusion layers 10 of memory cells lined
in a direction crossing the word lines WL. When patterning
is carried out for the control gate lines, a mask is formed of
PEP on the pillar-form silicon layers at an end of a cell array
to leave, on the surface of the silicon layers, the contact
portions 14 of a polysilicon film which connect with the
control gate lines. To the contact portions 14, the Al wires
13 which are to be control gate lines are contacted by Al films
formed simultaneously with the bit lines BL.</p>

    <p num="0016">A P-type silicon layer 2 with a low impurity
concentration is epitaxially grown on a P-type silicon
substrate 1 with a high impurity concentration to give a wafer.
A mask layer 21 is deposited on the wafer and a photoresist
pattern 22 is formed by a known PEP process. The mask
layer 21 is etched using the photoresist pattern 22 (see Fig.
1653(a)).</p>
    <p num="0017">The silicon layer 2 is etched by a reactive ion etching
method using the resulting mask layer 21 to form trenches 3
in a lattice form which reach the substrate 1. Thereby the
silicon layer 2 is separated into a plurality of pillar-form
islands. A silicon oxide film 23 is deposited by a CVD
method and anisotropically etched to remain on the sidewalls
of the pillar-form silicon layers 2. By implantation of N-type
impurity ions, drain diffusion layers 10 are formed on the top
of the pillar-form silicon layers 2 and common source
diffusion layers 9 are formed at the bottom of the trenches
(see Fig. 1653(b)).</p>
    <p num="0018">The oxide films 23 around the pillar-form silicon
layers 2 are etched away by isotropic etching. Channel ion
implantation is carried out on the sidewalls of the pillar-form
silicon layers 2 by use of a slant ion implantation as required.
Instead of the channel ion implantation, an oxide film
containing boron may be deposited by a CVD method with a
view to utilizing diffusion of boron from the oxide film. A
silicon oxide film 4 is deposited by a CVD method and
isotropically etched so that the silicon oxide film 4 of a
predetermined thickness is buried at the bottom of trenches
3. </p>
    <p num="0019">Tunnel oxide films 5 are formed to a thickness of
about 10 nm around the silicon layers 2 by thermal oxidation.
A first-layer polysilicon film is deposited and anisotropically
etched to remain on the lower sidewalls of the pillar-form
silicon layers 2 to be floating gates 6 around the silicon layers
2 (see Fig. 1654(c)).</p>
    <p num="0020">Interlayer insulating films 7 are formed on the
surface of the floating gates 6 formed around the pillar-form
silicon layers 2. The interlayer insulating films 7 are formed
of an ONO film, for example. The ONO film is formed by
oxidizing the surface of the floating gate 6 by a predetermined
thickness, depositing a silicon nitride film by a plasma-CVD
method and then thermal-oxidizing the surface of the silicon
nitride film. A second-layer polysilicon film is deposited and
anisotropically etched to form control gates 8 on lower parts
of the pillar-form silicon layers 2 (see Fig. 1654(d)). At this
time, by previously setting the intervals between the
pillar-form silicon layers 2 in a longitudinal direction at a
predetermined value or less, the control gates 8 are formed as
control gate lines continuous in the longitudinal direction in
Fig. 1651 without need to perform a masking process.
Unnecessary parts of the interlayer insulating films 7 and
underlying tunnel oxide films 2 are etched away. A silicon
oxide film 111 is deposited by a CVD method and etched
halfway down the trenches 3, that is, to such a depth that the
floating gates 6 and the control gates 8 of the memory cells
are buried and hidden (see Fig. 1655(e)).</p>
    <p num="0021">A gate oxide film 31 is formed to a thickness of about
20 nm on exposed upper parts of the pillar-form silicon layers 
2 by thermal oxidation. A third-layer polysilicon film is
deposited and anisotropically etched to form gate electrodes
32 of MOS transistors (see Fig. 1655 (f)). The gate electrodes
32 are patterned to be continuous in the same direction as
the control gate lines run, and form selection gate lines. The
selection gate lines can also be formed continuously in
self-alignment, but this is more difficult than the control
gates 8 of the memory cells. This is because, the selection
gate transistors are single-layer gates while the memory
transistors are two-layered gates, and therefore, the intervals
between adjacent selection gates are wider than the intervals
between the control gates. Accordingly, in order to ensure
that the gate electrodes 32 are continuous, the gate
electrodes may be formed in a two-layer polysilicon structure,
a first polysilicon film may be patterned to remain only in
locations to connect the gate electrodes by use of a masking
process, and a second polysilicon film may be left on the
sidewalls.</p>
    <p num="0022">Masks for etching the polysilicon films are so formed
that contact portions 14 and 15 of the control gate lines and
the selection gate lines are formed on the top of the
pillar-form silicon layers at different ends.</p>
    <p num="0023">A silicon oxide film 112 is deposited by a CVD
method and, as required, is flattened. Contact holes are
opened. An Al film is deposited and patterned to form Al
wires 12 to be bit lines BL, Al wires 13 to be control gate lines
CG and Al wires 16 to be word lines WL at the same time (see
Fig. 1656(g)).</p>
    <p num="0024">Fig. 1657(a) schematically shows a sectional 
structure of a major part of one memory cell of the prior-art
EEPROM, and Fig. 1657(b) shows an equivalent circuit of the
memory cell.</p>
    <p num="0025">The operation of the prior-art EEPROM is briefly
explained with reference to Figs. 1657(a) and 1657(b).</p>
    <p num="0026">For writing by use of injection of hot carriers, a
sufficiently high positive potential is applied to a selected
word line WL, and positive potentials are applied to a selected
control gate line CG and a selected bit line BL. Thereby, a
positive potential is transmitted to the drain of a memory
transistor Qc via a selection gate transistor Qs to let a
channel current flow in the memory transistor Qc and inject
hot carriers. Thereby, the threshold of the memory cell is
shifted toward positive.</p>
    <p num="0027">For erasure, 0 V is applied to a selected control gate
line CG and high positive potentials are applied to the word
line WL and the bit line BL to release electrons from the
floating gate to the drain. For erasing all the memory cells, a
high positive potential may be applied to the common sources
to release electrons to the sources. Thereby, the thresholds
of the memory cells are shifted toward negative.</p>
    <p num="0028">For reading, the selection gate transistor Qs is
rendered ON by the word line WL and a reading potential is
applied to the control gate line CG. The judgment of "0" or
"1" is made from the presence or absence of a current. In
the case where an FN tunneling is utilized for injecting
electrons, high positive potentials are applied to a selected
control gate line CG and a selected word line WL and 0 V is
applied to a selected bit line BL to inject electrons from the 
substrate to the floating gate.</p>
    <p num="0029">This prior art provides an EEPROM which does not
mis-operate even in an over-erased state thanks to the
presence of the selection gate transistors.</p>
    <p num="0030">The prior-art EEPROM does not have diffusion layers
between the selection gate transistors Qs and the memory
transistors Qc as shown in Fig. 1657(a). This is because, it
is hard to form the diffusion layers selectively on the
sidewalls of the pillar-form silicon layers. Therefore, in the
structure shown in Figs. 1652(a) and 1652(b), desirably,
separation oxide films between the gates of the memory
transistors and the gates of the selection gate transistors are
as thin as possible. In the case of utilizing the injection of
hot electrons, in particular, the separation oxide films need to
be about 30 to 40 nm thick for allowing a sufficient "H" level
potential to be transmitted to the drain of a memory
transistor.</p>
    <p num="0031">Such fine intervals cannot be practically made only
by burying the oxide films by the CVD method as described in
the above production process. Accordingly, desirably, the
CVD oxide films are buried in such a manner that the floating
gates 6 and the control gates 8 are exposed, and thin oxide
films are formed on exposed parts of the floating gates 6 and
the control gates 8 simultaneously with the formation of the
gate oxide films for the selection gate transistors.</p>
    <p num="0032">Further, according to the prior art, since the
pillar-form silicon layers are arranged with the bottom of the
lattice-form trenches forming an isolation region and the
memory cells are constructed to have the floating gates 
formed to surround the pillar-form silicon layers, it is
possible to obtain a highly integrated EEPROM in which the
area occupied by the memory cells is small. Furthermore,
although the memory cells occupy a small area, the capacity
between the floating gates and the control gates can be
ensured to be sufficiently large.</p>
    <p num="0033">According to the prior art, the control gates of the
memory cells are formed to be continuous in one direction
without using a mask. This is possible, however, only when
the pillar-form silicon layers are arranged at intervals
different between a longitudinal direction and a lateral
direction. That is, by setting the intervals between adjacent
pillar-form silicon layers in a word line direction to be smaller
than the intervals between adjacent pillar-form silicon layers
in a bit line direction, it is possible to obtain control gate
lines that are separated in the bit line direction and are
continuous in the word line direction automatically without
using a mask.</p>
    <p num="0034">In contrast, when the pillar-form silicon layers are
arranged at the same intervals both in the longitudinal
direction and in the lateral direction, a PEP process is
required.</p>
    <p num="0035">More particularly, the second-layer polysilicon film is
deposited thick, and through the PEP process to form a mask,
the second-layer polysilicon film is selectively etched to
remain in locations to be continuous as control gate lines.</p>
    <p num="0036">The third-layer polysilicon film is deposited and
etched to remain on the sidewalls as described regarding the
production process of the prior art. Even in the case where 
the pillar-form silicon layers are arranged at intervals
different between the longitudinal direction and the lateral
direction, the continuous control gate lines cannot be
automatically formed depending upon the intervals of the
pillar-form silicon layers.</p>
    <p num="0037">In this case, the mask process by the PEP process as
described above can be used for forming the control gate lines
continuous in one direction.</p>
    <p num="0038">Although the memory cells of the prior art as
described above are of a floating gate structure, the charge
storage layers do not necessarily have the floating gate
structure and may have a structure such that the storage of a
charge is realized by a trap in a laminated insulating film,
e.g., a MNOS structure.</p>
    <p num="0039">Fig. 1658 is a sectional view of a prior-art memory
with memory cells of the MNOS structure, corresponding to
Fig. 1652(a). A laminated insulating film 24 functioning as
the charge storage layer is of a laminated structure of a
tunnel oxide film and a silicon nitride film, or of a tunnel
oxide film, a silicon nitride film and further an oxide film
formed on the silicon nitride film.</p>
    <p num="0040">Fig. 1659 is a sectional view of a prior-art memory in
which the memory transistors and the selection gate
transistors of the above-described prior art are exchanged,
i.e., the selection gate transistors are formed in the lower
parts of the pillar-form silicon layers 2 and the memory
transistors are formed in the upper parts of the pillar-form
silicon layers 2. Fig. 1659 corresponds to Fig. 1652(a).
This structure in which the selection gate transistors are 
provided on a common source side can apply to the case
where the injection of hot electrons is used for writing.</p>
    <p num="0041">Fig. 1660 shows a prior-art memory in which a
plurality of memory cells are formed on one pillar-form silicon
layer. Like numbers denote like components in the
above-described prior-art memories and the explanation
thereof is omitted. In this memory, a selection gate
transistor Qs1 is formed in the lowermost part of a pillar-form
silicon layer 2, three memory transistors Qc1, Qc2 and Qc3
are laid above the selection gate transistor Qs1, and another
selection gate transistor Qs2 is formed above. This structure
can be obtained basically by repeating the aforesaid
production process. Regarding the prior art memory shown
in Fig. 1659 and Fig. 1660, it is needless to say that the
memory transistors of the MNOS structure can be used
instead of the memory transistors of the floating gate
structure.</p>
    <p num="0042">As described above, the prior-art techniques can
provide highly integrated EEPROMs whose control gates and
charge storage layers have a sufficient capacity therebetween
and whose memory cells occupy a decreased area, by
constructing the memory cells using memory transistors
having the charge storage layers and the control gates by use
of the sidewalls of the pillar-form semiconductor layers
separated by the lattice-form trenches.</p>
    <p num="0043">However, if a plurality of memory cells are connected
in series on one pillar-form semiconductor layer and the
thresholds of the memory cells are supposed to be the same,
significant changes take place in the thresholds of memory 
cells at both ends of the memory cells connected in series
owing to a back-bias effect of the substrate in a reading
operation. In the reading operation, the reading potential is
applied to the control gate lines CG and the "0" or "1" is
judged from the presence of a current. For this reason, the
number of memory cells connected in series is limited in view
of the performance of memories. Therefore, the production
of mass-storage memories is difficult to realize.</p>
    <p num="0044">The problem that the thresholds of memory cells are
changed owing to a back-bias effect is true not only of the
case where a plurality of memory cells are connected in series
on one pillar-form semiconductor layer but also of the case
where one memory cell is formed on one pillar-form
semiconductor layer, depending upon variations in the
back-bias effect of the substrate in an inplanar direction.</p>
    <p num="0045">In the prior-art memories, the charge storage layers
and the control gates are formed in self-alignment with the
pillar-form semiconductor layers. Taking mass storage of
the cell array into consideration, the pillar-form
semiconductor layers are preferably formed at the minimum
photoetching dimension. In the case where the floating gates
are used as the charge storage layers, a relationship of the
capacity coupling between the floating gates and the control
gates with the capacity coupling between the floating gates
and the substrate is determined by the area of the outer
periphery of the pillar-form semiconductor layers, the area of
the outer periphery of the floating gate, the thickness of the
tunnel oxide films insulating the floating gates from the
pillar-form semiconductor layers and the thickness of the 
interlayer insulating films insulating the floating gates from
the control gates. In the prior-art memories, the charge
storage layers and the control gates are formed to surround
the pillar-form semiconductor layers by utilizing the sidewalls
of the pillar-form semiconductor layers in order that the
capacity between the charge storage layers and the control
gates is ensured to be sufficiently large with a small area
occupied. However, in the case where the pillar-form
semiconductor layers are formed at the minimum
photoetching dimension and the thickness of the tunnel oxide
films and that of the interlayer insulating films are fixed, the
capacity between the charge storage layers and the control
gates is determined simply by the area of the outer periphery
of the floating gates, that is, the thickness of the floating
gates. Therefore, it is difficult to increase the capacity
between the charge storage layers and the control gates
without increasing the area occupied by the memory cells.
In other words, it is difficult to increase the ratio of the
capacity between the floating gates and the control gates to
the capacity between the floating gates and the pillar-form
semiconductor layers without increasing the area occupied by
the memory cells.</p>
    <p num="0046">Further, if transistors are formed in a direction
vertical to the substrate stage by stage, there occur variations
in characteristics of the memory cells owing to differences in
the properties of the tunnel oxide films and differences in the
profile of diffusion layers. Such differences are generated by
thermal histories different stage by stage.</p>
    <p num="0047">Furthermore, if gate electrodes of the transistors are 
formed in a direction vertical to the substrate stage by stage,
variations occur in gate lengths due to variations during the
production process. For example, to form the gate electrodes
in the form of a sidewall spacer, a gate electrode material film
is deposited and etched back to a depth corresponding to the
height of the island-like semiconductor layers. That is, in
order to realize the mass storage cell array, the number of
memory gates to be formed on the island-like semiconductor
layers increases, and inevitably the height of the island-like
semiconductor layers increases. This causes increase in the
variations in production process because the etch-back needs
to be carried out by a greater amount. Such an influence is
significant when the mass storage of the cell array is
intended.</p>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0066">The semiconductor memory of the present invention
mainly has a first conductivity type semiconductor substrate
and one or more memory cells. The memory cell is
constituted of at least one island-like semiconductor layer, at 
least one charge storage layer and at least one control gate (a
third electrode). The charge storage layer and the control
gate are formed around a sidewall of the island-like
semiconductor layer. At least one of said one or more
memory cells is electrically insulated from the semiconductor
substrate. An insulating film is provided which allows an
electric charge to pass through at least a part of a region
between the charge storage layer and the island-like
semiconductor layer.</p>
    <p num="0067">Alternatively, the semiconductor memory of the
present invention mainly has a first conductivity type
semiconductor substrate and one or more memory cells. The
memory cell is constituted of at least one island-like
semiconductor layer formed by epitaxial growth, at least one
charge storage layer and at least one control gate (a third
electrode). The charge storage layer and the control gate are
formed around a sidewall of the island-like semiconductor
layer. At least one of said one or more memory cells is
electrically insulated from the semiconductor substrate.</p>
    <p num="0068">That "at least one of said one or more memory cells is
electrically insulated from the semiconductor substrate"
means that the island-like semiconductor layer is electrically
insulated from the semiconductor substrate. If two or more
memory cells are formed in one island-like semiconductor
layer, the memory cells are electrically insulated and thereby
a memory cell/memory cells above an insulating site is/are
electrically insulated from the semiconductor substrate. If a
selection gate (a memory gate) is formed below the memory
cell(s), a selection transistor composed of the selection gate is 
electrically insulated from the semiconductor substrate or the
selection transistor is electrically insulated from a memory
cell and thereby a memory cell/memory cells above an
insulating site is/are electrically insulated from the
semiconductor substrate. It is preferably in particular that
the selection transistor is formed between the semiconductor
substrate and the island-like semiconductor layer or below
the memory cell(s) and the selection transistor is electrically
insulated from the semiconductor substrate. Electric
insulation may be made, for example, by forming a second
conductivity type impurity diffusion layer over a region to be
insulated, by forming the second conductivity type impurity
diffusion layer in part of the region to be insulated and
utilizing a depletion layer at a junction of the second
conductivity type impurity diffusion layer, or by providing a
distance not allowing electric conduction and achieving
electric insulation as a result. The semiconductor substrate
may be electrically insulated from the memory cell(s) or the
selection transistor by an insulating film of SiO<sub>2</sub> or the like.
In the case where a plurality of memory cells are formed in
one island-like semiconductor layer and selection transistors
are optionally formed above or below the memory cells, the
electric insulation may be formed between optional memory
cells and/or a selection transistor and a memory cell.</p>
    <p num="0069">The charge storage layer and the control gate may be
formed all around the sidewall of the island-like
semiconductor layer or on a part of the sidewall.</p>
    <p num="0070">Only one memory cell or two or more memory cells
may be formed on one island-like semiconductor layer. If 
three or more memory cells are formed, a selection gate is
preferably formed below and/or above the memory cells to
form a selection transistor together with the island-like
semiconductor layer.</p>
    <p num="0071">The insulating film provided between the charge
storage layer and the island-like semiconductor layer may be,
for example, a film usually functions as a tunnel insulating
film. Any insulating film may be used as long as it allows an
electron charge to pass through at least a certain region.
More particularly, the insulating film may be formed as a gate
insulating film over the almost entire surface of the
island-like semiconductor layer and as a tunnel gate
insulating film only in an entire region or a partial region
immediately below the charge storage layer. The insulating
film may be formed of a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride
film, a laminated film thereof (e.g., an NO film, an ON film, an
ONO film and the like). The insulating film may have a
uniform thickness or partially reduced thickness as long as it
allows the electric charge to pass through. The thickness
may suitably be adjusted depending on the voltage to be
applied to the semiconductor memory. For example, a
thickness of about 7 to 15 nm is preferable for the silicon
oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0072">Hereinafter, are explained constructions in which a
plurality of, for example, two memory cells are arranged in
series on one island-like semiconductor layer, island-like
semiconductor layers are arranged in matrix and selection
transistors are disposed below and above the memory cells.
A gate electrode of the selection transistor below the memory 
cells is represented as a second electrode and a gate electrode
of the selection transistor above the memory cells is
represented as a fifth electrode. A tunnel insulating film is
represented as a third insulating film, a sidewall spacer is
represented as a fourth insulating film, and a gate insulating
film which is a part of the selection transistor is represented
as a thirteenth insulating film.</p>
    <p num="0073">In the above-mentioned semiconductor memory, an
impurity diffusion layer for reading the state of a charge
stored in the memory cells is formed as a source or drain
(first wiring) of the memory cells in the island-like
semiconductor layer. This impurity diffusion layer
electrically insulates the island-like semiconductor layer from
the semiconductor substrate. Control gates formed in a
plurality of island-like semiconductor layers are arranged
continuously in one direction to form a control gate line (third
wiring). Another impurity diffusion layer is formed as a
drain or source of the memory cells in the island-like
semiconductor layer and a plurality of such impurity
diffusion layers in a direction crossing the control gate line
are electrically connected to form a bit line (fourth wiring).</p>
    <p num="0074">Although the control gate line and the bit line
orthogonal to the control gate may be in any
three-dimensional directions, are explained hereinafter
constructions in which the lines are formed in directions
horizontal to the semiconductor substrate.</p>

      <b>Embodiments of memory cell arrays as shown in plan
views</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0075">The memory cell array in the semiconductor memory 
of the present invention is described with reference to plan
views shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 14. Fig. 1 to Fig. 11 are plan
views illustrating EEPROM memory cell arrays having floating
gates as charge storage layers. Fig. 12 is a plan view
illustrating a memory cell array of MONOS structure having
laminated insulating films as charge storage layers, Fig. 13 is
a plan view illustrating a memory cell array of DRAM
structure having MIS capacitors as charge storage layers, and
Fig. 14 is a plan view illustrating a memory cell array of
SRAM structure having MIS transistors as charge storage
layers. Selection gate transistors are not shown in these
figures for avoiding complexity. These figures also illustrate
layouts of selection gate lines as second or fifth wiring which
are gate electrodes for selecting memory cells (referred to as
"selection gates" hereinafter), control gates as third wiring, bit
lines as fourth wiring and source lines as first wiring.</p>
    <p num="0076">In Fig. 1, island-like semiconductor layers in a
columnar form for constituting memory cells are arranged to
be located at intersections where a group of parallel lines and
another group of parallel lines cross at right angles. For
example, the island-like semiconductor layers are not
disposed alternately but aligned in vertical and lateral
directions. First, second, third and fourth wiring layers 840
for selecting and controlling the memory cells are disposed in
parallel to the surface of the substrate.</p>
    <p num="0077">By changing intervals between island-like
semiconductor layers between an A-A' direction which crosses
the fourth wiring layers 840 and a B-B' direction which is
parallel to the fourth wiring layers 840, second conductive 
films which act as the control gates of the memory cells are
formed continuously in one direction, in the A-A' direction in
Fig. 1, to be the third wiring layers.</p>
    <p num="0078">Likewise, second conductive films which act as the
gates of the selection gate transistors are formed
continuously in one direction to be the second wiring layers.</p>
    <p num="0079">A terminal for electrically connecting with the first
wiring layer disposed on a substrate side of island-like
semiconductor layers is provided, for example, at an A' side
end of a row of memory cells connected in the A-A' direction
in Fig. 1, and terminals for electrically connecting with the
second and third wiring layers are provided at an A side end
of the row of memory cells connected in the A-A' direction in
Fig. 1. The fourth wiring layers 840 disposed on a side of
the island-like semiconductor layers opposite to the substrate
are electrically connected to the island-like semiconductor
layers in the columnar form for constituting memory cells.
In Fig. 1, the fourth wiring layers 840 are formed in the
direction crossing the second and third wiring layers.</p>
    <p num="0080">The terminals for electrically connecting with the
first wiring layers are formed of island-like semiconductor
layers, and the terminals for electrically connecting with the
second and third wiring layers are formed of second
conductive films covering the island-like semiconductor layers,
respectively.</p>
    <p num="0081">The terminals for electrically connecting with the
first, second and third wiring layers are connected to first
contacts 910, second contacts 921 and 924 and third

    <p num="0082">In Fig. 1, the first wiring layers 810 are lead out onto
the top of the semiconductor memory via the first contacts
910.</p>
    <p num="0083">The arrangement of the island-like semiconductor
layers in the columnar form is not particularly limited to that
shown in Fig. 1 but may be any arrangement so long as the
above-mentioned positional relationship and electric
connection between the wiring layers are realized.</p>
    <p num="0084">For example, the island-like semiconductor layers
connected to the first contacts 910 are all located at the A'
side ends of the memory cells connected in the A-A' direction
in Fig. 1. However, they may be located entirely or partially
on the A side ends or may be located at any of the island-like
semiconductor layers constituting the memory cells connected
in the A-A' direction.</p>
    <p num="0085">The island-like semiconductor layers covered with
the second conductive films connected to the second contacts
921 and 924 and the third contacts 932 and 933 may be
located at the ends where the first contacts 910 are not
disposed, may be located continuously at the ends where the
first contacts 910 are disposed, and may be located at any of
the island-like semiconductor layers constituting the memory
cells connected in the A-A' direction which crosses the fourth
wiring layers 840. The second contacts 921 and 924 and the
third contacts 932 may be located at different places.</p>
    <p num="0086">The width and shape of the first wiring layers 810
and the fourth wiring layers 840 are not particularly limited
so long as a desired wiring can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="0087">In the case where the first wiring layers, which are 
disposed on the substrate side of the island-like
semiconductor layers, are formed in self-alignment with the
second and third wiring layers formed of the second
conductive films, the island-like semiconductor layers which
act as the terminals for electrically connecting with the first
wiring layers are electrically insulated from the second and
third wiring layers but contact the second and third wiring
layers with intervention of insulating films. In Fig. 1, for
example, first conductive films are formed partially on the
sidewalls of the island-like semiconductor layers connected to
the first contacts 910 with intervention of insulating films.
The first conductive films are located to face the island-like
semiconductor layers for constituting the memory cells. The
second conductive films are formed on the sidewalls of the
first conductive films with intervention of insulating films.
The second conductive films are connected to the second and
third wiring layers formed continuously in the A-A' direction.
At this time, the shape of the first and the second conductive
films is not particularly limited.</p>
    <p num="0088">The first conductive films on the sidewalls of the
island-like semiconductor layers which act as the terminals
for electrically connecting with the first wiring layers may be
removed by setting the intervals between said island-like
semiconductor layers to the first conductive films on the
island-like semiconductor layers for constituting the memory
cells, for example, to be two or less times larger than the
thickness of the second conductive films.</p>
    <p num="0089">In Fig. 1, the second and third contacts are formed
on the second conductive films 521 to 524 which are formed 
to cover the top of the island-like semiconductor layers.

realized.</p>
    <p num="0090">Fig. 1 also shows lines for sectional views to be used

the memory function according to the state of a charge stored
in the charge storage layer. The operating principles for
reading, writing and erasing data will be explained with a
memory cell having a floating gate as the charge storage layer,
for example.</p>
    <p num="0148">Reading, writing and erasing processes are now
explained with a semiconductor memory according to the
present invention which is constructed to include a plurality
of (e.g., M × N, wherein M and N are positive integers)

    <p num="0149">Fig. 65 shows the equivalent circuit diagram of the
above-described memory cell array. In this example, the
memory cell has a threshold of 0.5 V or higher when it is in
the written state and has a threshold of -0.5 V or lower when
it is in the erased state.</p>
    <p num="0150">Now an example of the reading process is described.
Fig. 78 shows an example of timing of applying a potential to
each electrode for reading data.</p>
    <p num="0151">First, 0 V is applied to the first wires (1-1 to 1-N),
the second wires (2-1 to 2-N), the third wires (3-1-1 to 3-N-L),
the fourth wires (4-1 to 4-M) and the fifth wires (5-1 to 5-N),
respectively. In this state, 3V is applied to the fourth wire 
(4-i), 3V is applied to the second wire (2-j), 3V is applied to
the fifth wire (5-j), and 3V is applied to the third wires (not
3-j-h) other than the third wire (3-j-h). Thereby a "0" or "1"
is judged from a current flowing through the fourth wire (4-i)
or the first wire (1-j).</p>
    <p num="0152">The third wires (not 3-j-h) other than the third wire
(3-j-h) are returned to 0 V, and the second wires (not 2-j) and
the fifth wires (not 5-j) are returned to 0 V. Then the fourth
wire (4-i) is returned to 0 V. The potentials may be applied
to the respective wires in another order or simultaneously.
In the above example, the reading process has been described
with the case where the selected cell is a memory cell having
the third wire (3-j-h) as the gate electrode. However, the
reading process is the same with the case where the selected
cell is a memory cell having a third wire other than the third
wire (3-j-h) as the gate electrode.</p>
    <p num="0153">The reading may be carried out in sequence from the
third wire (3-j-L) to the third wire (3-j-1), in a reverse order or
in a random order. Data may be read out simultaneously
from a plurality of or all memory cells connected with the
third wire (3-j-h).</p>
    <p num="0154">Have been described above the example of the
principle of reading in the case where M × N island-like
semiconductor layers having a plurality of (e.g., L) memory
cells arranged in series and selection transistors formed to
sandwich the memory cells are formed and the first wires and
the third wires are arranged in parallel to each other. By
providing the selection gates in the top and the bottom of a
set of memory cells, it is possible to prevent the phenomenon 
that a cell current flows even through a non-selected cell in
the case where a memory cell transistor is over-erased, i.e., a
threshold is negative and a reading gate voltage is 0 V.</p>
    <p num="0155">Now an example of the writing process is described.
Fig. 79 shows an example of timing of applying a potential to
each electrode for writing data.</p>
    <p num="0156">First, 0 V is applied to the first wires (1-1 to 1-N),
the second wires (2-1 to 2-N), the third wires (3-1-1 to 3-N-L),
the fourth wires (4-1 to 4-M) and the fifth wires (5-1 to 5-N),
respectively. In this state, 3 V is applied to the fourth wires
(not 4-i) other than the fourth wire (4-i), 1 V is applied to the
fifth wire (5-j), 3 V is applied to the third wires (not 3-j-h)
other than the third wire (3-j-h), and then 20 V is applied to
the third wire (3-j-h). This state is maintained for a desired
period of time to generate a state in which a high potential is
applied only to a region between the channel and the control
gate of the selected cell. Electrons are injected from the
channel to the charge storage layer by F-N tunneling
phenomenon. By applying 3 V to the fourth wires (not 4-i)
other than the fourth wire (4-i), is cut off the selection gate
transistor having the fifth electrode in the island-like
semiconductor layer which does not include the selected cell,
thereby data writing is not performed.</p>
    <p num="0157">Thereafter, the third wire (3-j-h) is returned to 0 V,
the second wire (2-i) and the fifth wire (5-j) are returned to 0
V, and then the third wires (not 3-j-h) other than the third
wire (3-j-h) are returned to 0 V. Then, the fourth wire (4-i) is
returned to 0 V.</p>
    <p num="0158">The timing of applying the potentials to the 
respective electrodes may be in another order or simultaneous.
The potentials applied may be any combination of potentials
so long as they satisfy conditions for storing negative electric
charges of not less than a certain amount in the charge
storage layer of a desired cell. In the above example, the
writing process has been described with the case where the
selected cell is a memory cell having the third wire (3-j-h) as
the gate electrode. However, the writing process is the same
with the case where the selected cell is a memory cell having
a third wire other than the third wire (3-j-h) as the gate
electrode. The writing may be carried out in sequence from
the third wire (3-j-L) to the third wire (3-j-1), in a reverse
order or in a random order. Data may be written
simultaneously in a plurality of or all memory cells connected
with the third wire (3-j-h).</p>
    <p num="0159">Further, described is an example of data writing
wherein the selection gate transistor having the fifth electrode
in the island-like semiconductor layer which does not include
the selected cell is not cut off. Fig. 84 shows an example of
timing of applying a potential to each electrode for writing
data.</p>
    <p num="0160">First, for example, 0 V is applied to the first wires
(1-1 to 1-N), the second wires (2-1 to 2-N), the third wires
(3-1-1 to 3-N-L), the fourth wires (4-1 to 4-M) and the fifth
wires (5-1 to 5-N), respectively. In this state, 7 V is applied
to the fourth wires (not 4-i) other than the fourth wire (4-i),
20 V is applied to the fifth wire (5-j), 3 V is applied to the
third wires (not 3-j-h) other than the third wire (3-j-h), and
then 20 V is applied to the third wire (3-j-h). This state is 
maintained for a desired period of time to generate potential
difference of about 20 V between the channel and the control
gate of the selected cell. Electrons are injected from the
channel to the charge storage layer by F-N tunneling
phenomenon for writing data.</p>
    <p num="0161">At this time, there is generated a potential difference
of about 13 V between the channel and the control gate of a
non-selected cell connected to the third wire (3-j-h).
However, in a period for data writing to the selected cell,
electrons are not injected to the non-selected cell in an
amount enough to vary the threshold of the non-selected cell,
thereby data is not written in the non-selected cell.</p>

is applied to the second wire (2-j), and then 20 V is applied to
the fifth wire (5-j). This state is maintained for a desired

    <p num="0169">Reading, writing and erasing processes are now
explained with a semiconductor memory according to the

A plurality of (e.g., N × 2) third wires are arranged in parallel

each electrode for reading data.</p>
    <p num="0172">First, 0 V is applied to the first wires (1-1 to 1-N),
the third wires (3-j-1 and 3-j-2), the third wires (not 3-j-1, not

state, 1V is applied to the fourth wire (4-i), and then 5 V is
applied to the third wire (3-j-2). Thereby a "0" or "1" is
judged from a current flowing through the fourth wire (4-i) or
the first wire (1-j, wherein j is a positive integer, 1 ≦ j ≦ N).
Then, the third wire (3-j-2) is returned to 0 V, and then the
fourth wire (4-i) is returned to 0 V. The potentials may be
applied to the respective wires in another order or
simultaneously. In the above example, the reading process
has been described with the case where the selected cell is a

However, the reading process is the same with the case where
the selected cell is a memory cell having a third wire other

    <p num="0173">Now an example of the writing process is described.
Fig. 82 shows an example of timing of applying a potential to

first wires (1-1 to 1-N), the third wires (3-1-1 to 3-N-2) and
the fourth wires (4-1 to 4-M), respectively. In this state, the 
fourth wires (not 4-i) other than the fourth wire (4-i) are
opened. Then, 6 V is applied to the fourth wire (4-i), 6 V is
applied to the third wire (3-j-2), and then 12 V is applied to
the third wire (3-j-1). This state is maintained for a desired
period of time to generate channel hot electrons in the
neighborhood of the diffusion layer at a high potential side of
the selected cell. The generated electrons are injected to the
charge storage layer of the selected cell by use of a high
potential applied to the third wire (3-j-1) for writing data.</p>
    <p num="0174">Thereafter, the third wire (3-j-1) is returned to 0 V,
the third wire (3-j-2) is returned to 0 V, the fourth wire (4-i) is

    <p num="0175">Now an example of the erasing process is described.
Fig. 83 shows an example of timing of applying each potential 
for erasing data. The data erasing is performed block by
block, or only in an upper row or a lower row in a word line or
a block.</p>
    <p num="0176">First, for example, 0 V is applied to the first wires
(1-1 to 1-N), the third wires (3-1-1 to 3-N-2) and the fourth
wires (4-1 to 4-M), respectively. In this state, the fourth
wires (4-1 to 4-M) are opened. Then, 5 V is applied to the
first wire (1-j), 5 V is applied to the third wire (3-j-2), and
then 10 V is applied to the third wire (3-j-1). This state is
maintained for a desired period of time to withdraw the
electrons from the charge storage layer of the selected cell by
F-N tunneling phenomenon for erasing data. Thereafter, the
third wire (3-j-1) is returned to 0 V, the third wire (3-j-2) is
returned to 0 V, the first wire (1-j) is returned to 0 V, and
then the fourth wires (4-1 to 4-M) are returned to 0 V. The
timing of applying the potentials to the respective electrodes
may be in another order or simultaneous. The potentials

conductive film a potential such that a reverse layer is formed
at an interface between the island-like semiconductor layer

    <p num="0218">First, a silicon nitride film 310, for example, is
deposited to 200 to 2,000 nm as a first insulating film to be a
mask layer on a surface of a P-type silicon substrate 100, for
example, as a semiconductor substrate. Using as a mask
layer a resist film R1 patterned by a known photolithographic
technique (Fig. 85 and Fig. 106), the silicon nitride film 310
is etched by reactive ion etching (RIE). Using this silicon
nitride film 310 as a mask, the p-type silicon substrate 100 is
etched 2000 to 20000 nm by RIE to form first trench 210 in
the form of a lattice (Fig. 86 and Fig. 107). Thereby the
p-type silicon substrate 100 is formed into a plurality of
island-like semiconductor layers 110 in the pillar form which
are insulated from each other. Here, consideration is given
to the case where the resulting island-like semiconductor
layers 110 are substantially columnar. As the
semiconductor substrate, usable are elementary
semiconductor substrates such as a germanium substrate, 
compound semiconductor substrates such as a GaAs
substrate and a ZnSe substrate, mixed crystal semiconductor
substrates such as a silicon germanium semiconductor and
the like in addition to a silicon substrate. Not only a bulk
substrate but also an SOI substrate, a multi-layered SOI
substrate and the like may be used. Among these substrates,
a silicon substrate is preferred.</p>
    <p num="0219">Next, a thermally oxidized film 410 is formed as a
second insulating film. At this time, the growing rate of the
thermally oxidized film may possibly be anisotropic in
directions parallel to the semiconductor substrate 100 on the
sides of the island-like semiconductor layers 110 due to
crystal orientation. For example, suppose that the
island-form semiconductor layers 110 are formed of silicon
and that, as shown in Fig. 126(a), direction A-A' and direction
B-B' are &lt;110&gt; orientation of silicon crystal and direction
C-C' and direction D-D' are &lt;100&gt; orientation of silicon
crystal. In this case, since the silicon crystal is oxidized
faster in the &lt;110&gt; direction than in the &lt;100&gt; direction, the
thickness of the oxide film is anisotropic in directions parallel
to the semiconductor substrate 100. As a result, as shown
in Fig. 126(b), Fig. 126(c) and Fig. 127, the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 are in a form of somewhat
quadratic prism rather than a columnar form (Fig. 87 and Fig.
108). For another example in which the thermally oxidized
film 410 has anisotropy, as shown in Fig. 129(a) to Fig. 129(c),
the island-like semiconductor layers 110 formed by RIE may
be in an octagonal shape or may possibly be shifted + 22.5°
(Fig. 129(b)) or - 22.5° (Fig. 129(c)) with respect to Fig. 129(a). 
For still another examples, the thermally oxidized film 410
may have a circular outer circumference as shown in Fig.
130(a), the outer circumference may shift, for example, + 45°
as shown in Fig. 130(b), the interface between the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 and the thermally oxidized film 410
may be in a circular shape, as shown in Fig. 130(c), and the
outer circumference may shift, for example, + 45° as shown
in Fig. 130(d).</p>
    <p num="0220">For example, reaction limited oxidation is conducted
under an oxygen atmosphere at a temperature of about 800 to
900 °C for about 10 to 100 minutes. The thermal
oxidization of the present invention is not limited to the
above-mentioned technique, but any technique that allows at
least two thicknesses to form on the sides of the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 may be used.</p>
    <p num="0221">At this time, where the island-like semiconductor
layers 110 are formed in the minimum photoetching
dimension, the dimension of the island-like semiconductor
layers 110 is reduced by the formation of the thermally
oxidized film 410. In other words, the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 are formed in a dimension smaller
than the minimum photoetching dimension.</p>
    <p num="0222">Next, the thermally oxidized film (the second
insulating film) 410 is etched away from the periphery of each
island-like semiconductor layer 110, for example, by isotropic
etching. Then, as required, channel ion implantation is
carried out into the sidewall of each island semiconductor
layer 110 using slant ion implantation. For example, the ion
implantation may be performed at an implantation energy of 5 
to 100 keV at a boron dose of about 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 1 ×
10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of 5 to 45° with respect to the normal
line of the surface of the substrate. Preferably the channel
ion implantation is performed from various directions to the
island-like semiconductor layers 110 because a surface
impurity concentration becomes more uniform. Alternatively,
instead of the channel ion implantation, an oxide film
containing boron may be deposited by CVD with a view to
utilizing diffusion of boron from this oxide film. The
impurity implantation from the surface of the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 may be carried out before the
island-like semiconductor layers are covered with the
thermally oxidized film 410, or the impurity implantation may
be finished before the island-like semiconductor layers 110
are formed. A means for the implantation is not particularly
limited so long as an equal impurity concentration
distribution in the island-like semiconductor layers 110 is
obtained.</p>
    <p num="0223">Subsequently, the thermally oxidized film 410 is
removed. Then, a silicon oxide film 420 is formed as a third
insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film by thermal
oxidization (Fig. 88 and Fig. 109). At this time, the
thickness of the thermally oxidized film also becomes
anisotropic owing to the anisotropy of the speed of thermal
oxidization, which further renders the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 closer to the shape of a quadratic
prism. In this case, since the thermally oxidized film grows
thinner in the C-C' direction and the D-D' direction which are
the &lt;100&gt; orientation of silicon crystal, the thermally oxidized 
film growing in the C-C' direction and the D-D' direction is an
effective tunnel oxide film. This practically reduces the area
of the tunnel oxide film and improves the ratio of the
capacitance of the floating gate and the control gate to the
capacitance of the floating gate and the island-like
semiconductor layer.</p>
    <p num="0224">In the case where the A-A' direction and the B-B'
direction are the &lt;100&gt; orientation of silicon crystal and the
C-C' direction and the D-D' direction are the &lt;110&gt;
orientation of silicon crystal (Fig. 130 and Fig. 131), if the
thermal oxidization is conducted in the same manner as in
the case where the A-A' direction and the B-B' direction are
the &lt;110&gt; orientation of silicon crystal and the C-C' direction
and the D-D' direction are the &lt;100&gt; orientation of silicon
crystal, the island-like semiconductor layers are obtained in a
shape of a substantial rhombohedral prism after the silicon
oxide film 420 is formed as the tunnel oxide film (Fig. 130) .
Since this case also has an effect in substantially reducing
the area of the tunnel oxide film, the ratio of the capacitance
of the floating gate and the control gate to the capacitance of
the floating gate and the island-like semiconductor layer is
improved.</p>
    <p num="0225">In the case where the island-like semiconductor
layers 110 are formed as described above, the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 need not necessarily be
substantially columnar, but may be in various shapes, for
example, having a polygonal, elliptic or other cross section.
When the third insulating film is formed, the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 may be in the shape of a quadratic 
prism. It is sufficient that at least two thicknesses are
formed on the sides of the island-like semiconductor layers
110. At this time, the tunnel oxide film is not limited to a
thermally oxidized film, but may be a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0226">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 510, for example, is
deposited to about 50 to 200 nm as a first conductive film
(Fig. 89 and Fig. 110). Then, a silicon nitride film 321, for
example, is deposited to 5 to 50 nm as a fourth insulating
film by CVD.</p>
    <p num="0227">Subsequently, the silicon nitride film 321 is etched to
remain in the form of sidewalls on the sidewalls of the
polysilicon film 510 (Fig. 90 and Fig. 111). A silicon oxide
film 431, for example, is deposited to 50 to 500 nm as a fifth
insulating film in the first lattice-form trench 210 by CVD (Fig.
91 and Fig. 112).</p>
    <p num="0228">The silicon oxide film 431 is removed to a desired
depth to form buried layers in the first lattice-form trench
210 (Fig. 92 and Fig. 113).</p>
    <p num="0229">Using the silicon oxide film 431 as a mask, the silicon
nitride film 321 is isotropically etched to remain only between
the silicon oxide film 431 and the polysilicon film 510 (Fig. 93
and Fig. 114). At this time, the silicon nitride film 321 is
lower than the top surface of the silicon oxide film 431 to
form a recess.</p>
    <p num="0230">In this recess, a silicon oxide film 441 is deposited as
a sixth insulating film to about 3 to 30 nm. At this time, the
above recess is filled if the thickness of the silicon oxide film
441 is about half or more of the thickness of the silicon
nitride film 321. Since the oxide film 441 also deposits on 
the sidewall of the polysilicon film 510, the oxide film 441 is
removed from the sidewall of the polysilicon film 510, for
example, by isotropic etching. Thereby the silicon oxide film
441 remains in the recess, and the silicon nitride film 321 is
buried with the silicon oxide film 431 and the silicon oxide
film 441.</p>
    <p num="0231">Subsequently, in the same manner, a silicon nitride
film 322 is deposited to about 5 to 50 nm as a fourth
insulating film by CVD. The silicon nitride film 322 is
etched by RIE to remain in the form of a sidewall on the
sidewall of the polysilicon film 510 (Fig. 94 and Fig. 115).</p>
    <p num="0232">Thereafter, in the same manner, a silicon oxide film
432 is buried as a fifth insulating film, and a silicon oxide
film 442 is disposed as a sixth insulating film on the top of
the silicon nitride film 322 in the sidewall form in the same
manner as the silicon oxide film 441 is formed as the fourth
insulating film. Thereafter, a silicon nitride film is formed a
sidewall 323 on the sidewall of the polysilicon film 510 in the
same manner as described above (Fig. 95 and Fig. 116).</p>
    <p num="0233">By repeating these steps, a plurality of sidewalls are
formed of the silicon nitride film as the fourth insulating film
on the sidewall of the polysilicon film 510 (Fig. 96 and Fig.
117).</p>
    <p num="0234">The polysilicon film 510 is divided by isotropic
etching.</p>
    <p num="0235">The polysilicon film 510 is divided into polysilicon
films 511 to 514 which are first conductive films. This
division may be conducted by thermal oxidization using as a
mask the silicon nitride films 321 to 324 as fourth insulating 
films or by combination of etching and thermal oxidization.</p>
    <p num="0236">Impurity introduction is carried out into the
island-like semiconductor layers 110 and the semiconductor
substrate 100 in self-alignment with the divided polysilicon
films 511 to 514 and the silicon nitride film 310. For
example, N-type impurity diffusion layers 710 to 724 are
formed in an arsenic concentration of about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 ×
10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> using a diffusion process (e.g., solid, solid-vapor or
vapor phase diffusion process, etc.). At this time, the
impurity diffusion layer 710 to be a first wiring layer may be
adjusted about its impurity concentration by ion implantation
or the like (Fig. 97 and Fig. 118). For example, the ion
implantation may be performed at an implantation energy of 5
to 100 keV in a phosphorus dose of about 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> to 1 ×
10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> in a direction inclined by about 0 to 7° .</p>
    <p num="0237">The timing of forming the impurity diffusion layer 710
is not necessarily the same as the timing of forming the
N-type semiconductor layers 721 to 724. For example, the
impurity diffusion layer 710 may be formed by ion
implantation after the formation of the thermally oxidized film
410 or after the formation of the silicon oxide film 420.
Alternatively, the impurity diffusion layer 710 may be formed
by combining two or more of these timings.</p>
    <p num="0238">Thereafter, exposed portions of the polysilicon films
511 to 514 are thermally oxidized selectively to form silicon
oxide films 450 of 5 to 50 nm thickness which are seventh
insulating films. At this time, the impurity is diffused from
the impurity diffusion layers 710 to 724 by thermal treatment
to electrically float P-type regions of the island-like 
semiconductor layer 110 (Fig. 98 and Fig. 119). The timing
of the impurity introduction to the polysilicon films 511 to
514 is not particularly limited so long as these films become
conductive films. For example, the impurity introduction
may be performed during the formation of the polysilicon film
510 or during the impurity introduction into the island-like
semiconductor layers 110.</p>
    <p num="0239">Thereafter, the sidewalls 321 to 324 of the silicon
nitride film are removed, for example, by isotropic etching.
Then, a silicon oxide film 461 is deposited to 50 to 500 nm as
an eighth insulating film and isotropically or anisotropically
etched so that the silicon oxide film 461 is embedded to bury
the side of the polysilicon 511.</p>
    <p num="0240">A silicon nitride film 331, for example, is deposited to
5 to 50 nm as a ninth insulating film on the polysilicon films
512 to 514 and the silicon oxide film 450 to form sidewalls
(Fig. 99 and Fig. 120).</p>
    <p num="0241">Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 461 as an eighth
insulating film is etched back to a degree that the side of the
polysilicon film 511 is exposed, and a polysilicon film 521, for
example, is deposited to 15 nm to 150 nm as a second
conductive film (Fig. 100 and Fig. 121). Thereafter, as
shown in Fig. 121, a second trench 220 is formed in the
p-type silicon substrate 100 in self-alignment with the
polysilicon film 521 to separate the impurity diffusion layer
710. That is, a separation portion of the first wiring layer is
formed in self-alignment with a separation portion of the
second conductive film.</p>
    <p num="0242">Subsequently, the polysilicon film 521 is etched back 
to a degree such that the polysilicon film 521 can contact the
polysilicon film 511 to form a selection gate. At this time, by
setting the intervals between the island-like semiconductor
layers 110 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined
value or-smaller, the polysilicon film 521 is formed into a
second wiring layer to be a selection gate line continuous in
the direction without need to use a masking process.
Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 462 is deposited to 50 to 500
nm as an eighth insulating film and is anisotropically or
isotropically etched so that the silicon oxide film 461 is
embedded to bury the side and top of the polysilicon film 521.</p>
    <p num="0243">Next the sidewall of the silicon nitride film 331 as the
ninth insulating film is removed by isotropic etching and an
interlayer insulating film 612 is formed on exposed surfaces
of the polysilicon films 512 to 514 (Fig. 101 and Fig. 122).
This interlayer insulating film 612 may be formed of an ONO
film, for example. More particularly, a silicon oxide film of 5
to 10 nm thickness is formed on the surface of the polysilicon
film by thermal oxidization, and then, a silicon nitride film of
5 to 10 nm thickness and a silicon oxide film of 5 to 10 nm
thickness are formed sequentially by CVD.</p>
    <p num="0244">Subsequently, in the same manner, a polysilicon film
522 to be a second conductive film is deposited to 15 to 150
nm and etched back so that the polysilicon film 522 is
disposed on the side of the polysilicon film 512 with
intervention of the interlayer insulating film 612 (Fig. 102
and Fig. 123). At this time, by setting the intervals between
the island-like semiconductor layers 110 in the direction of
A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined value or smaller, the 
polysilicon film 522 is formed into a third wiring layer to be a
control gate line continuous in the direction of A-A' without
need to use a masking process.</p>
    <p num="0245">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 463 is deposited to 50
to 500 nm as an eighth insulating film and is anisotropically
or isotropically etched so that the silicon oxide film 463 is
embedded to bury the side and top of the polysilicon film 522.</p>
    <p num="0246">By repeating likewise, a polysilicon film 523 is
disposed as a second conductive film on the side of the
polysilicon film 513 with intervention of an interlayer
insulating film 613 (Fig. 103 and Fig. 124), and the oxide film
463 is embedded to bury the side and top of the polysilicon
film 522.</p>
    <p num="0247">With regard to the polysilicon film 514 which is the
topmost first conductive film, a polysilicon film 524 as a
second conductive film is etched back to a degree such that
the polysilicon film 524 can contact the polysilicon film 514
as the first conductive film, in the same manner as the
polysilicon film 511 which is the bottommost first conductive
film. A silicon oxide film 465, for example, is deposited to
100 to 500 nm as a tenth insulating film on the top of the
polysilicon film 524. The top portion of the island-like
semiconductor layer 110 provided with the impurity diffusion
layer 724 is exposed by etch-back or by CMP. A fourth
wiring layer is formed so that its direction crosses the
direction of the second or third wiring layer and is connected
to the top of the island-like semiconductor layer 110.</p>
    <p num="0248">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring 
are formed (Fig. 104 and Fig. 125). Fig. 104 shows that the
metal wiring is placed on the impurity diffusion layer 724
without mis-alignment. However, even if mis-alignment
occurs, the metal wiring can be connected to the impurity
diffusion layer 724 as shown in Fig. 105 (This is true of the
following production examples). Thereby, a semiconductor
memory device is realized which has a memory function
according to the state of a charge in the charge storage layer
which is the floating gate made of the polysilicon film as the
first conductive film.</p>
    <p num="0249">So long as the anisotropy of the thermally oxidized
film is obtained, crystal orientation is not necessarily a
combination of &lt;110&gt; and &lt;100&gt;, the semiconductor
substrate may be formed of a material other than silicon, and
the island-like semiconductor layers may not be in a quadratic
prism shape but in a shape close to a hexagonal prism.</p>
    <p num="0250">In this example, films formed on the surface of the
semiconductor substrate or the polysilicon film such as the
silicon nitride film 310, the silicon nitride films 321, 322, 323
and 324 and the silicon nitride film 331 may be formed of a
layered film of a silicon oxide film/a silicon nitride film from a
silicon surface side.</p>
    <p num="0251">For forming the buried silicon oxide film, the silicon
oxide film may be formed not only by CVD but also by
rotational coating.</p>
    <p num="0252">In the example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a
mask. That is possible only in the case where the island-like
semiconductor layers are not disposed symmetrically to a 
diagonal. More particularly, by setting smaller the intervals
between adjacent island-like semiconductor layers in the
direction of the second and third wiring layers than those in
the direction of the fourth wiring layer, it is possible to obtain
the wiring layers which are discontinuous in the direction of
the fourth wiring layer and are continuous in the direction of
the second and third wiring layers without using a mask. In
contrast, if the island-like semiconductor layers are disposed
symmetrically to a diagonal, for example, the wiring layers
may be separated through patterning with use of resist films
by photolithography.</p>
    <p num="0253">By providing the selection gates in the top and the
bottom of a set of memory cells, it is possible to prevent the
phenomenon that a memory cell transistor is over-erased, i.e.,
a reading voltage is 0V and a threshold is negative and
thereby the cell current flows even through a non-selected
cell.</p>
    <p num="0254">In this production example, the first lattice-form
trench 210 is formed on the P-type semiconductor substrate.
However, the first lattice-form trench 210 may be formed in
an impurity diffusion layer of the same conductivity type as
that of the semiconductor substrate, the impurity diffusion
layer being formed in a P-type impurity diffusion layer formed
in an N-type semiconductor substrate or in an N-type
impurity diffusion layer formed in a P-type semiconductor

conductivity type as that of the semiconductor substrate may
be formed in an impurity diffusion layer which is of the
conductivity type opposite to that of the semiconductor 
substrate and is formed in the island-like semiconductor
layer. There are true of the following all production examples.</p>
    <p num="0255">This production example is applicable to the following
various production examples.</p>
    <heading>Production Example 2</heading>
    <p num="0256">With regard to Production Example 1, this example is
particularly shown for forming the tunnel oxide film partially
on the periphery of the island-like semiconductor layer 110 in
a pillar form.</p>
    <p num="0257">Figs. 132 to 139 and Figs. 140 to 147 are sectional
views taken on line A-A' and line B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1
illustrating a memory cell array of EEPROM.</p>
    <p num="0258">In this example, production steps are the same as
those in Production Example 1 until the thermally oxidized
film 410 is etched away and, as required, ions are implanted
for the channel region on the sidewall of each island-like
semiconductor layer 110 by utilizing the slant ion
implantation (Fig. 137 and Fig. 140).</p>
    <p num="0259">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 430, for example, is
deposited to 50 to 200 nm as a fifth insulating film and is
etched by RIE to remain in the form of a sidewall on the
sidewall of each island-like semiconductor layer 110. A
silicon nitride film 320, for example, is deposited as a fourth
insulating film so that the island-like semiconductor layers
110 are continuous in the A-A' direction in Fig. 1 with
intervention of the silicon nitride film 320 and discontinuous
in the B-B' direction (Fig. 133 and Fig. 141). Alternatively,
the silicon nitride film 320 may be so deposited that the
island-like semiconductor layers 110 are continuous both in 
the A-A' direction and in the B-B' direction, and later the
silicon nitride film 320 may be separated in the B-B' direction
using a resist film patterned by a known photolithographic
technology.</p>
    <p num="0260">Next, the silicon nitride film 320 is isotropically
etched so that the silicon oxide film 430 is exposed in the
B-B' direction and the island-like semiconductor layers 110
are still continuous in the A-A' direction with intervention of
the silicon nitride film 320 (Fig. 134 and Fig. 142). That is,
the silicon nitride film 320 remains on a part of the periphery
of the silicon oxide film 430.</p>
    <p num="0261">Subsequently, the exposed part of the silicon oxide
film 430 is removed by isotropic etching so that the silicon
oxide film 430 remains in a region sandwiched by the silicon
nitride film 320 and the island-like semiconductor layer 320
(Fig. 135 and Fig. 143).</p>
    <p num="0262">Thereafter, the silicon nitride film 320 is removed by
isotropic etching (Fig. 136 and Fig. 144). At this time, the
etch amount is so adjusted that the silicon nitride film 310 is
not completely removed.</p>
    <p num="0263">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 420, for example,
is formed as a third insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film
of a thickness of about 10 nm on the periphery of each
exposed island-like semiconductor layer 110 using thermal
oxidation (Fig. 137 and Fig. 145). The tunnel oxide film is
not limited to a thermally oxidized film but may be a CVD
oxide film or a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0264">Thereafter, production steps are in accordance with
those of Production Example 1 after a polysilicon film 510, for 
example, is deposited to about 50 nm to 200 nm as a first
conductive film (Figs. 138 to 139 and Fig. 146 to 147).
Thereby the silicon oxide film 430 remains in regions where
the island-like semiconductor layers 110 face each in the A-A'
direction, and therefore, the tunnel oxide film is not formed in
the regions. Accordingly, this example has an advantage in
that the area of the tunnel oxide film decreases with respect
to regions where the floating gate faces the control gate in
each memory cell, which leads to improvement in the coupling
ratio.</p>
    <heading>Production Example 3</heading>
    <p num="0265">With regard to Production Example 1, this example is
particularly shown for forming the tunnel oxide film in
opposing regions in the A-A' direction as shown in Fig. 1 as
an example of forming the tunnel oxide film partially on the
periphery of the island-like semiconductor layer 110 in the
pillar form.</p>
    <p num="0266">Figs. 148 to 157 and Figs. 158 to 167 are sectional
views taken on line A-A' and line B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1
illustrating a memory cell array of EEPROM.</p>
    <p num="0267">In this example, production steps are the same as
those in Production Example 1 until the p-type silicon
substrate 100 as the semiconductor substrate is etched 2,000
to 20,000 nm by RIE using as a mask the silicon nitride film
310 as the first insulating film to form the lattice-form trench
210 (Fig. 148 and Fig. 158).</p>
    <p num="0268">Thereafter, the surface of each island-like
semiconductor layer 110 is oxidized to form a thermally
oxidized film 410 to be a second insulating film of about 10 
nm to 100 nm thickness (Fig. 149 and Fig. 159).</p>
    <p num="0269">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 320, for example,
is deposited to about 50 nm to 500 nm as a fourth insulating
film so that the island-like semiconductor layers 110 are
continuous in an A-A' direction in Fig. 9 with intervention of
the thermally oxidized film 410 as the second insulating film
and are discontinuous in a B-B' direction of Fig. 9 (Fig. 150
and Fig. 160).</p>
    <p num="0270">Thereafter, the silicon nitride film 320 is isotropically
etched so that the silicon nitride film 320 remains only to
face the island-like semiconductor layers 110 in the A-A'
direction (see Fig. 151 and Fig. 161). That is, the thermally
oxidized film 410 is exposed in the B-B' direction.
Alternatively, the island-like semiconductor layers 110 may
be formed continuously both in the A-A' direction and in the
B-B' direction with intervention of the thermally oxidized film
410 and the silicon nitride film 320, and later, the silicon
nitride film 320 is separated in the B-B' direction using a
resist film patterned by a known photolithography technique.</p>
    <p num="0271">Thereafter, the exposed thermally oxidized film 410 is
further oxidized to form a thermally oxidized film 411 as a
second insulating film (Fig. 152 and Fig. 162).</p>
    <p num="0272">The silicon nitride film 320 is removed by isotropic
etching (Fig. 153 and Fig. 163). At this time, the etch
amount is adjusted so that the silicon nitride film (the first
insulating film) 310 is not completely etched away.</p>
    <p num="0273">Subsequently, the island-like semiconductor films
110 are exposed in a region where the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 face each other, by isotropically 
etching away the silicon oxide film by a thickness about the
same as the thickness of the thermally oxidized film 410 (Fig.
154 and Fig. 164).</p>
    <p num="0274">Next, a silicon oxide film 420, for example, is formed
as a third insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film of about 10
nm on the surface of each of the exposed island-like
semiconductor layers 110, for example, using thermal
oxidation (Fig. 155 and Fig. 165). The tunnel oxide film is
not limited to the thermally oxidized film but may be a CVD
oxide film or a nitrogen oxide film. When the silicon oxide
film 420 is formed, the thickness and etch amount of
thermally oxidized film 410 are pre-set so that the charged
stage of the charge storage layer is not affected by tunnel
current.</p>
    <p num="0275">Thereafter, production steps are in accordance with
those of Production Example 1 after a polysilicon film 510, for
example, is deposited to about 50 nm to 200 nm as a first
conductive film (Figs. 156 to 159 and Fig. 166 to 167).
Thereby the thermally oxidized film 411 remains in regions
where the island-like semiconductor layers 110 face each
other in the B-B' direction, and the tunnel oxide film is not
formed. Accordingly, this example has an advantage in that
the area of the tunnel oxide film decreases with respect to
regions where the floating gates face the control gates in
memory cells, which leads to improvement in the coupling
ratio.</p>
    <heading>Production Example 4</heading>
    <p num="0276">With regard to Production Example 1, this example is
particularly shown for forming the tunnel oxide film partially 
on the periphery of the pillar-form island-like semiconductor
layer 110.</p>
    <p num="0277">Figs. 168 to 178 and Figs. 179 to 181 are sectional
views taken on line A-A' and line B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1
illustrating a memory cell array of EEPROM.</p>
    <p num="0278">In this example, production steps are the same as
those in Production Example 1 until the thermally oxidized
film 410 is formed as the second insulating film (Fig. 168 and
Fig. 179), the thermally oxidized film 410 is etched away and,
as required, the channel ion implantation is carried out on
the sidewall of each island-like semiconductor layer 110, for
example, using slant ion implantation.</p>
    <p num="0279">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 452, for example, is
deposited to about 5 to 50 nm as a twenty-eighth insulating
film and anisotropically etched to remain in the form of a
sidewall on the sidewall of each island-like semiconductor
layer 110. At this time, the silicon oxide film 452 may be
formed by thermal oxidation, or the thermally oxidized film
421 as the second insulating film may be used without being
removed. The silicon oxide film 452 may be used as it is
deposited without being formed in the sidewall form.</p>
    <p num="0280">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 362, for example,
is deposited to about 5 nm to 50 nm as a twenty-seventh
insulating film, and thereafter, is anisotropically etched in
the form of a sidewall on the sidewall of each island-like
semiconductor layers 110 with intervention of the silicon
oxide film 452.</p>
    <p num="0281">Next, a silicon oxide film 435, for example, is
deposited to 50 to 500 nm as a twenty-fifth insulating film, 
and thereafter, is buried by isotropic etching to a degree such
that the silicon oxide film 435 reaches at least the top end of
a first conductive film 512 which is to be formed by a later
step (Fig. 169 and Fig. 180).</p>
    <p num="0282">Using the silicon oxide film 435 as a mask, the
silicon nitride film 362 is etched to remain only between the
silicon oxide film 452 and the silicon oxide film 435 (Fig. 170
and Fig. 181). At this time, the silicon nitride film 362 forms
a recess with respect to the top surface of the silicon oxide
film 435.</p>
    <p num="0283">A silicon oxide film 445, for example, is deposited to
3 to 30 nm as a twenty-sixth insulating film in the recess (Fig.
171 and Fig. 182). At this time, the recess can be buried if
the silicon oxide film 445 has about half the thickness of the
silicon nitride film 362. Since the silicon oxide film 445 also
deposits on the sidewall of the silicon oxide film 452, the
silicon oxide film 445 is removed from the sidewall of the
silicon oxide film 452, for example, by isotropic etching. The
silicon oxide film 452 may be removed from the top surface of
the silicon oxide film 435, and a film of about the same
thickness may be formed. Thereby, the silicon oxide film
445 remains in the recess, and the silicon nitride film 362 is
buried by the silicon oxide film 435 and the silicon oxide film
445 (Fig. 172 and Fig. 183).</p>
    <p num="0284">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 363, for example,
is deposited to about 5 to 50 nm as a twenty-seventh
insulating film, and thereafter, is anisotropically etched to
remain in the form of a sidewall on the sidewall of each
island-like semiconductor layer 110 with intervention of the 
silicon oxide film 452 (Fig. 173 and Fig. 184).</p>
    <p num="0285">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 436 which is a
twenty-fifth insulating film is buried in the same manner, and
a silicon oxide film 446 which is a twenty-sixth insulating
film is disposed on the top of the silicon nitride film 363 in
the form of a sidewall spacer, in the same manner as the
silicon oxide film 445 is formed.</p>
    <p num="0286">Next, a silicon nitride film 364 which is a
twenty-seventh insulating film is formed in the form of a
sidewall on the sidewall of the island-like semiconductor layer
110 with intervention of a silicon oxide film 452 (Fig. 174 and
Fig. 185).</p>
    <p num="0287">Thereafter, using the silicon oxide films 362, 363 and
364 which are twenty-seventh insulating films as a mask, the
silicon oxide films 435 and 436, the silicon oxide films 445
and 446 and the silicon oxide film 452 are removed by
isotropic etching (Fig. 175 and Fig. 186).</p>
    <p num="0288">Subsequently, the silicon nitride films 362, 363 and
364 are removed by isotropic etching. A silicon oxide film
420, for example, is formed as a third insulating film to be a
tunnel oxide film of about 10 nm thickness on the periphery
of each island-like semiconductor layer 110, for example,
using a CVD technique (Fig. 176 and Fig. 187). At this time,
the tunnel oxide film is not limited to a CVD oxide film but
may be a thermal oxide film or a nitrogen oxide film. The
thickness of the silicon oxide film 452 increases as the silicon
oxide film 420 is formed, and the silicon oxide film 452 is
always thicker than the silicon oxide film 420.</p>
    <p num="0289">Thereafter, production steps are in accordance with 
those of Production Example 1 after a polysilicon film 510, for
example, is deposited to about 50 nm to 200 nm as a first
conductive film (Fig. 177 and Fig. 188). It is sufficient that
the silicon oxide film 420 which is the third insulating film to
be a tunnel oxide film is formed between the desired first
conductive film and island-like semiconductor layer 110. For
example, the silicon oxide film 420 may be unevenly
distributed on the top or at the bottom of the polysilicon film
or may be partially overlapped with the impurity diffusion
layer. An example of distribution of the silicon oxide film is
shown in Fig. 178 and Fig. 189.</p>
    <p num="0290">Also, an example is shown in which the silicon oxide
film 420 is formed by thermal oxidation (Figs. 190 to 191 and
Figs. 192 to 193).</p>
    <p num="0291">Further, when the silicon oxide film 420 is formed by
thermal oxidation or the like, the formed oxidized film may
have or may not have isotropy, as in the above-described
Example 1.</p>
    <p num="0292">By the above-described production method, the
semiconductor memory device is produced to have memory
cells with a plurality of tunnel oxide films and floating gates
as charge storage layers on the sidewalls of the island-like
semiconductor layers 110. In the semiconductor memory
device, the island-like semiconductor layers are in electrically
floated state with respect to the semiconductor substrate and
the active region of each of the memory cells is in electrically
floated state. The selection gates are disposed on the top
and at the bottom of the island-like semiconductor layers.
The area of the tunnel oxide film between the floating gate of 
the memory cell and the island-like semiconductor layer is
smaller than the area of the floating gate contacting the
island-like semiconductor layer. It is possible to
simultaneously form the selection gates and floating gates of
the respective transistors.</p>

For example, the silicon oxide film 420 may be unevenly

However, it is possible to prevent tunnel current to the silicon
nitride film of the MONOS structure by controlling the

    <p num="0324">In this example, production steps are the same as
those in Production Example 1 until the thermally oxidized
film 410 is formed as the second insulating film, the
thermally oxidized film 410 is etched away and, as required,
the channel ion implantation is carried out on the sidewalls of
the semiconductor layers using slant ion implantation.</p>
    <p num="0325">Next, a silicon oxide film 434, for example, is
deposited to about 50 to 500 nm as a twenty-fifth insulating
film, and is buried, for example, by isotropic etching to a
position such that the silicon oxide film 434 will overlap a
impurity diffusion layer 721 to be formed in a later step as an
N-type semiconductor layer.</p>
    <p num="0326">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 452, for example, is
deposited to about 50 to 500 nm as a twenty-eighth
insulating film, and then is anisotropically etched to remain
in the form of a sidewall on the sidewall of each island-like
semiconductor layer 110. At this time, the silicon oxide film
452 may be formed by thermal oxidation or the thermally
oxidized film 410 may be used without being removed. Also
the silicon oxide film 452 need not necessarily be formed in
the form of a sidewall but may be used as it is deposited.</p>
    <p num="0327">Further, a silicon nitride film 362, for example, is
deposited to about 5 to 50 nm as a twenty-seventh insulating 
film, and then is anisotropically etched to remain in the form
of a sidewall on the sidewall of each island-like
semiconductor layer 110 with intervention of the silicon oxide
film 452 (Fig. 222 and Fig. 232).</p>
    <p num="0328">Next, a silicon oxide film 435, for example, is
deposited to about 50 to 500 nm as a twenty-fifth insulating
film, and is buried, for example, by isotropic etching to a
degree such that the silicon oxide film 435 will reach at least
the top end of a first conductive film 512 which is to be
formed in a later production step (Fig. 223 and Fig. 233).</p>
    <p num="0329">Subsequently, using the silicon oxide film 435 as a
mask, the silicon nitride film 362 is isotropically etched to
remain only between the silicon oxide film 452 and silicon
oxide film 435 (Fig. 224 and Fig. 234). Thereby, the silicon
nitride film 362 forms a recess with respect to the top surface
of the silicon oxide film 435.</p>
    <p num="0330">A silicon oxide film 445 is deposited to 3 to 30 nm as
a twenty-sixth insulating film in this recess (Fig. 225 and Fig.
235). At this time, if the silicon oxide film 445 has about
half or more the thickness of the silicon nitride film 362, the
above-mentioned recess is buried with the silicon oxide film
445. Since the oxide film 445 also deposits on the sidewall
of the silicon oxide film 452, the silicon oxide film 445 is
removed from the sidewall of the silicon oxide film 452, for
example, by isotropic etching. The silicon oxide film 452
may be once removed from the top surface of the silicon oxide
film 435 and a similar film may be formed again. Thereby,
the silicon oxide film 445 remains in the recess and the
silicon nitride film 362 is buried with the silicon oxide film 
435 and the silicon oxide film 445 (Fig. 226 and Fig. 236).</p>
    <p num="0331">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 363, for example,
is deposited to about 5 to 50 nm as a twenty-seventh
insulating film, and then is anisotropically etched to remain
in the form of a sidewall on the sidewall of each island-like
semiconductor layer 110 with intervention of the silicon oxide
film 452 (Fig. 227 and Fig. 237).</p>
    <p num="0332">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 436 as a twenty-fifth
insulating film is buried in the same manner as described
above, and a silicon oxide film 446 as a twenty-sixth
insulating film is disposed on the top of the silicon nitride
film 363 in the form of a sidewall in the same manner as the
silicon oxide film 445 is formed.</p>
    <p num="0333">Next, in the same manner as described above, a
silicon nitride film 364 as a twenty-seventh film is formed to
remain in the form of a sidewall on the sidewall of each
island-like semiconductor layer 110 with intervention of the
silicon oxide film 452.</p>
    <p num="0334">Subsequently, in the same manner as described
above, a silicon oxide film 437 as a twenty-fifth insulating
film is buried to a position such that the silicon oxide film
437 will overlap an impurity diffusion layer 723 which is to be
formed later as an N-type semiconductor layer. The silicon
nitride film 364 is etched to remain only between the silicon
oxide film 452 and the silicon oxide film 437 in the same
manner as the silicon nitride films 362 and 363 are etched
(Fig. 228 and Fig. 238).</p>
    <p num="0335">Thereafter, using the silicon nitride films 362, 363
and 364 as a mask, the silicon oxide films 435 and 436, the 
silicon oxide films 445 and 446 and the silicon oxide film 452
are removed by isotropic etching (Fig. 229 and Fig. 239).</p>
    <p num="0336">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 420 is formed as a
third insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film of about 10 nm
thickness on the periphery of each island-like semiconductor
layer 110, for example, by CVD (Fig. 230 and Fig. 240). At
this time, the tunnel oxide film is not necessarily limited to a
CVD film, but may be a thermally oxidized film or a nitrogen
oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0337">Thereafter, production steps are in accordance with
those of Production Example 1 after a polysilicon film 510, for
example, to be a first conductive film is deposited to about 50
to 200 nm (Fig. 231 and Fig. 241).</p>
    <p num="0338">It is sufficient that the silicon oxide film 420 which is
the third insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film between the
silicon nitride films 362 and 363 and between the silicon
nitride films 363 and 364 is formed between the desired first
conductive film and island-like semiconductor layer 110. For
example, the silicon oxide film 420 may be unevenly
distributed on the top or at the bottom of the polysilicon film
or may be partially overlapped with the impurity diffusion
layer.</p>
    <p num="0339">Where the silicon nitride films 362, 363 and 364
remain when the silicon oxide film 420 is formed, the
insulating film intervening between the floating gates and the
island-like semiconductor layers 110 is of MONOS structure
by the silicon oxide film 452, the silicon nitride films 362,
363 and 364 and the silicon oxide film 420. However, it is
possible to prevent tunnel current to the silicon nitride film of 
the MONOS structure by controlling the thickness of the
selection gates, the floating gates, the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 and the silicon oxide film 452.</p>
    <p num="0340">Further, when the silicon oxide film 420 is formed by
thermal oxidation or the like, the formed oxidized film may
have or may not have isotropy, as in the above-described
Example 1.</p>
    <p num="0341">Further, as required, after the channel ion
implantation is carried out on the sidewalls of the island-like
semiconductor layers 110, for example, by slant ion
implantation (Figs. 85 to 87 and Figs. 106 to 108), a silicon
nitride film 471, for example, may be deposited to 50 to 500
nm as an eleventh insulating film and isotropically or
anisotropically etched to be buried in the first trench 210 to
about the height of the top end of the lower selection gate.
Thereafter, a silicon nitride film 340, for example, may be
deposited to 5 to 50 nm as a twelfth insulating film to form a
sidewall (Fig. 242 and Fig. 245). Subsequently, a silicon
oxide film 472 may be deposited to 50 to 500 nm in the same
manner as the eleventh insulating film and isotropically or
anisotropically etched to be buried in the first trench 210 to
about the height of the bottom end of the upper selection gate.
Thereafter, using the silicon oxide film 472 which is an
eleventh insulating film as a mask, the sidewall of the silicon
nitride film 340 may be partially removed by isotropic etching
(Fig. 243 and Fig. 246). Subsequently, an oxide film 480 of
about 15 to 25 nm is formed as a thirteenth insulating film
on the periphery of each island-like semiconductor layer 110,
for example, using thermal oxidation (Fig. 244 and Fig. 247). 
Then, the sidewall of the silicon nitride film 340 is removed
and a silicon nitride film 434, for example, is deposited to 50
to 500 nm as a twenty-fifth insulating film. Thereafter, the
same production steps as described above in Production
example 1 may be carried out so that the thickness of the
gate insulating films of the selection gate transistors is larger
than the thickness of the gate insulating films of the memory
transistors.</p>
    <p num="0342">Also, after the sidewall of the silicon nitride film 340
is removed, this production example may be combined with
any one of the other production examples.</p>
    <p num="0343">By the above-described production method, it is
possible to simultaneously form the selection gates and the
floating gates of the respective transistors of the
semiconductor memory device in which the selection gates are
formed on the top and at the bottom of the island-like
semiconductor layers and the area of the tunnel oxide films
between the floating gates of the memory cells and the
island-like semiconductor layers is smaller than the area of
the floating gates contacting the island-like semiconductor

    <p num="0347">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 431, for example,
is deposited to 50 to 500 nm as a fifth insulating film in the
first trench 210 by CVD, and is buried to a desired depth of
the first trench 210 by etching back the silicon oxide film 431.
At this time, the silicon oxide film 431 may be deposited
without etching away the thermally oxidized film 410 and be
etched back to the desired depth.</p>

formed by thermal oxidation or the thermally oxidized film
410 may be used without being removed. Also the silicon

N-type impurity diffusion layers 710 to 724 are formed at an
arsenic concentration of about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>31</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>
using solid or vapor phase diffusion. At this time, the
impurity concentration in the impurity diffusion layer 710 to
be a first wiring layer may be adjusted by ion implantation
(Fig. 268 and Fig. 282). For example, this ion implantation
may be carried out at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV
at a phosphorus dose of about 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> in

oxide film 450 as a seventh insulating film, for example. At
this time, by thermal oxidization, the impurity in the impurity
diffusion layers 710 to 724 are diffused so that the p-type
region of the island-like semiconductor layer 110 becomes in
a floating state, and further, the impurity diffusion layers 710
to 724 need to reach the nearest ends of the polysilicon films
511 to 514 with intervention of an oxide film 420 as a third
insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film (Fig. 269 and Fig.

511 to 514 may be performed when the polysilicon film 510 is
formed or when the impurity is introduced into the island-like
semiconductor layer 110. The timing of introducing the
impurity is not limited so long as the conductive film is
formed. </p>
    <p num="0384">Thereafter, production steps after the sidewalls 321

etching are in accordance with those of Production Example
1.</p>
    <p num="0385">In the example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a
mask. However, that is possible only where the island-like
semiconductor layers are not disposed symmetrically to a
diagonal. More particularly, by setting smaller the intervals
between adjacent island-like semiconductor layers in the
direction of the second and third wiring layers than those in
the direction of the fourth wiring layer, it is possible to
automatically obtain the wiring layers which are
discontinuous in the direction of the fourth wiring layer and
are continuous in the direction of the second and third wiring
layers without using a mask. In contrast, if the island-like
semiconductor layers are disposed symmetrically to a
diagonal, for example, the wiring layers may be separated
through patterning with use of resist films by
photolithography.</p>
    <p num="0386">By providing the selection gates in the top and the
bottom of a set of memory cells, it is possible to prevent the
phenomenon that a memory cell transistor is over-erased, i.e.,
a reading voltage is 0V and a threshold is negative, and
thereby the cell current flows even through a non-selected
cell.</p>

Fig. 294), the thermally oxidized film 410 is etched away and
as required the channel ion implantation is carried out on the
sidewalls of the island-like semiconductor layers 110, for
example, using slant ion implantation.</p>
    <p num="0390">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 452, for example, is
deposited to about 5 to 50 nm as a twenty-eighth insulating
film and is anisotropically etched to remain in the form of
sidewall on the sidewall of each island-like semiconductor
layer 110. At this time, the silicon oxide film 452 may be
formed by thermal oxidation or the thermally oxidized film
410 may be used without being removed. The silicon oxide
film 452 may be used as deposited without being formed into
the form of sidewall.</p>
    <p num="0391">Further, a silicon nitride film 362, for example, is
deposited to about 5 to 50 nm as a twenty-seventh insulating
film and then is anisotropically etched to remain in the form
of sidewall on the sidewall of the island-like semiconductor
layer 110 with intervention f the silicon oxide film 452.</p>
    <p num="0392">Next, a silicon oxide film 435, for example, is 
deposited to 50 to 500 nm as a twenty-fifth insulating film
and then is buried by isotropic etching to a degree such that
the silicon oxide film 435 will reach at least the top of the
first conductive film 511 to be formed in a later step (Fig. 285
and Fig. 295).</p>
    <p num="0393">Using the silicon oxide film 435 as a mask, the
silicon nitride film 362 is etched by isotropic etching to
remain only between the silicon oxide film 452 and the silicon
oxide film 435 (Fig. 286 and Fig. 296). At this time, the
silicon nitride film 362 forms a recess with respect to the top
surface of the silicon oxide film 435.</p>
    <p num="0394">A silicon oxide film 445, for example, is deposited to
3 to 30 nm as a twenty-sixth insulating film in the recess (Fig.
287 and Fig. 297). At this time, the recess can be buried if
the silicon oxide film 445 has about half or more the
thickness of the silicon nitride film 362. Since the silicon
oxide film 445 also deposits on the sidewall of the silicon
oxide film 452, the silicon oxide film 445 is removed from the
sidewall of the silicon oxide film 452, for example, by
isotropic etching. The silicon oxide film 452 may be removed
from the top surface of the silicon oxide film 435, and a film
of about the same thickness may be formed. Thereby, the
silicon oxide film 445 remains in the recess, and the silicon
nitride film 362 is buried with the silicon oxide film 435 and
the silicon oxide film 445 (Fig. 288 and Fig. 298).</p>
    <p num="0395">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 363, for example,
is deposited to about 5 to 50 nm as a twenty-seventh
insulating film, and then is anisotropically etched to remain
in the form of sidewall on the sidewall of the island-like 
semiconductor layer 110 with intervention of the silicon oxide
film 452 (Fig. 289 and Fig. 299).</p>
    <p num="0396">Thereafter, in the same manner as described above, a
silicon oxide film 436 as a twenty-fifth film is buried, and a
silicon oxide film 446 is disposed as a twenty-sixth insulating
film on a silicon nitride film 363 in the form of sidewall as a
twenty-seventh insulating film in the same manner as the
silicon oxide film 445 is formed.</p>
    <p num="0397">Next, in the same manner as described above, a
silicon nitride film 364 as a twenty-seventh insulating film is
formed in the form of sidewall on the sidewall of island-like
semiconductor layer 110 with intervention of the silicon oxide
film 452 (Fig. 290 and Fig.300).</p>
    <p num="0398">Thereafter, using silicon nitride films 362, 363 and
364 which are twenty-seventh insulating films as a mask, the
silicon oxide films 435 and 436, the silicon oxide film 445 and
446 and the silicon oxide film 452 are removed by isotropic
etching (Fig.291 and Fig. 301).</p>
    <p num="0399">Subsequently, the silicon nitride films 362, 363 and
364 are removed by isotropic etching, and then a silicon oxide
film 420, for example, is formed as a third insulating film to
be a tunnel oxide film of about 10 nm on the periphery of
each island-like semiconductor layer 110, for example, using
CVD (Fig. 292 and 302). At this time, the tunnel oxide film
is not limited to a CVD oxide film, but may be a thermally
oxidized film or a nitrogen oxide film. The thickness of the
silicon oxide film 452 increases to be always thicker than the
silicon oxide film 420 as the silicon oxide film 420 is formed.</p>
    <p num="0400">Thereafter, production steps are in accordance with 
those of Production Example 1 after a polysilicon film 510, for
example, to be a first conductive film is deposited to about 50
nm to 200 nm (Fig. 293 and Fig. 303). However, the
selection gate transistors are not formed.</p>
    <p num="0401">It is sufficient that the silicon oxide film 420 which is
the third insulating film to be the tunnel oxide film is formed
between the desired first conductive film and island-like
semiconductor layer 110. For example, the silicon oxide film
420 may be unevenly distributed on the top or at the bottom
of the polysilicon film or may be partially overlapped with the
impurity diffusion layer.</p>
    <p num="0402">Further, when the silicon oxide film 420 is formed by
thermal oxidation or the like, the formed oxidized film may
have or may not have isotropy, as in the above-described
Example 1.</p>
    <p num="0403">In the above-described example, is described the
method wherein the charge storage layers are formed at the
same time on the sides of the island-like semiconductor
layers 110 formed by patterning the semiconductor substrate,
but various methods may be combined.</p>
    <p num="0404">As shown in the above-described production method,
a plurality of memory cells having the charge storage layers
and the control gates are connected in series in a direction
perpendicular to the semiconductor substrate. The memory
cells are formed on the sides of the island-like semiconductor
layers arranged in matrix and insulated in the lattice form on
the semiconductor substrate. The impurity diffusion layers
disposed on the island-like semiconductor layers are sources
or drains of the memory cells. The semiconductor substrate 
is electrically insulated from the island-like semiconductor
layers by the impurity diffusion layers. The control gates
constitute control gate lines which are disposed continuously
with regard to a plurality of island-like semiconductor layers
in one direction and are formed in a horizontal direction with
respect to the semiconductor substrate. The bit lines are
electrically connected with the impurity diffusion layers in a
direction crossing the control gate lines and are arranged in
the horizontal direction with respect to the semiconductor
substrate. However, the above-listed features may be
combined in various ways.</p>
    <p num="0405">Are described examples in which, unlike the
conventional memory, an impurity diffusion layer is so formed
that an active region of each memory cell formed on a
semiconductor substrate or semiconductor layer which is
patterned in a pillar form is in a floating state with respect to
the semiconductor substrate. Further, before the formation of
the semiconductor substrate or the semiconductor layer to be
the active region, a region for forming a charge storage layer
formed of a laminated film comprising plural films is precisely
defined in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the
semiconductor substrate by controlling the thickness of each
film, and then the charge storage layer is formed in this
region.</p>
    <heading>Production Example 11</heading>
    <p num="0406">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this
example, regions for forming charge storage layers are defined
in advance by a laminated film comprising plural films and
then island-like semiconductor layers in a pillar form are 
formed by selective epitaxial silicon growth in trenches
opened by using a photoresist mask. Tunnel oxide films and
floating gates as charge storage layers are formed on the sides
of the island-like semiconductor layers in the regions for
forming the charge storage layers. The island-like
semiconductor layers are each in an electrically floating state
with respect to the semiconductor substrate. The active
region of each memory cell is in the electrically floating state.</p>
    <p num="0407">In the semiconductor memory, selection gate
transistors are disposed at the top and the bottom of the
island-like semiconductor layer. A plurality of memory
transistors, for example, two memory transistors, are placed
between the selection gate transistors. The tunnel oxide film
and the floating gate of the transistors are formed at the same
time. The transistors are connected in series along the
island-like semiconductor layer. Further, the thickness of
gate insulating films of the selection gate transistors is equal
to the thickness of gate insulating films of the memory
transistors.</p>
    <p num="0408">Figs. 304 to 336 and Figs. 337 to 368 are sectional
views taken on line A-A' and line B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1
which is a plan view illustrating an EEPROM memory cell
array.</p>
    <p num="0409">First, on a surface of a P-type silicon substrate 2100,
a silicon oxide film 2411 containing arsenic impurities of
about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>22</sup> /cm<sup>3</sup>, for example, is deposited as a
first insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm by CVD.
At this time, ion implantation may be carried out to introduce
the impurities to the insulating film deposited by CVD. For 
example, to the silicon oxide film 2411 deposited to a
thickness of 50 to 500 nm, ion implantation may be carried
out at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at an arsenic
dose of about 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of about 0
to 45° with respect to the normal line of the surface of the
substrate. The impurity introduction to the silicon oxide
film 2411 by ion implantation may not necessarily be carried
out immediately after the deposition of the silicon oxide film
2411. Regarding the ion implantation to the silicon oxide
film 2411, the angle for the implantation is not particularly
limited as long as a desired impurity concentration is
obtained. Means for the impurity introduction to the silicon
oxide film 2411 is not limited to the ion implantation, but any
means such as solid or vapor phase diffusion may be used.</p>
    <p num="0410">Thereafter, a silicon nitride film 2321, for example, is
deposited as a fourth insulating film to a thickness of 10 to
100 nm. If the above-mentioned impurity introduction to the
silicon oxide film 2411 is carried out by ion implantation, the
impurities may be introduced by ion implantation through the
silicon nitride film 2321 into the silicon oxide film 2411.</p>
    <p num="0411">Then, a silicon oxide film 2421, for example, is
deposited as a third insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm and a silicon nitride film 2312 is deposited as a
second insulating film to a thickness of 10 to 100 nm.
Further, a silicon oxide film 2412 containing impurities is
deposited as a first insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500
nm, a silicon nitride film 2322 is deposited as a fourth
insulating film to a thickness of 10 to 100 nm, and a silicon
oxide film 2422 is deposited as a third insulating film to a 
thickness of 50 to 500 nm. Thus, the films are sequentially
formed. Then, as shown in Figs. 304 and 335, a silicon
oxide film 2415 containing impurities is deposited as a first
insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm and a silicon
nitride film 2325 is deposited as a fourth insulating film to a
thickness of 500 to 5,000 nm.</p>
    <p num="0412">Subsequently, using a resist film R1 patterned by a
known photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 304 and
337), reactive ion etching, for example, is performed to
sequentially etch the silicon nitride film 2325, the silicon
oxide film 2415, the silicon nitride film 2315, the silicon
oxide film 2424, the silicon nitride film 2324, the silicon
oxide film 2414, the silicon nitride film 2314, the silicon
oxide film 2423, the silicon nitride film 2323, the silicon
oxide film 2413, the silicon nitride film 2313, the silicon
oxide film 2422, the silicon nitride film 2322, the silicon
oxide film 2412, the silicon nitride film 2312, the silicon
oxide film 2421, the silicon nitride film 2321 and the silicon
oxide film 2411, thereby forming a fourth trench 2240 (Figs.
305 and 338).</p>
    <p num="0413">The resist film R1 is removed and then island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 are filled in the fourth trench
2240. For example, the island-like semiconductor layers
2110 are formed by selective epitaxial growth from the P-type
silicon substrate 2100 located at the bottom of the fourth
trench 2240 (Figs. 306 and 339). The thus formed
island-like semiconductor layers 2110 are flattened to be
flush with the silicon nitride film 2325. The flattening may
be carried out by isotropic or anisotropic etch-back, CMP, or 
a combination in various ways.</p>
    <p num="0414">Thereafter, a polysilicon film 2540, for example, is
deposited as a fourth conductive film to a thickness of about
100 to 300 nm and a silicon nitride film 2330 is deposited as
a fifth insulating film to a thickness of about 200 to 2,000 nm
(Figs. 307 and 340).</p>
    <p num="0415">Using a resist film R2 patterned by a known
photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 308 and 341),
reactive ion etching, for example, is performed to successively
etch the silicon nitride film 2330, the polysilicon film 2540,
the silicon nitride film 2325 and the silicon oxide film 2415,
thereby exposing the silicon nitride film 2315 (the second
insulating film). At this time, the silicon nitride film 2315
may be etched until the silicon oxide film 2424 (the third
insulating film) is exposed.</p>
    <p num="0416">After the resist film R2 is removed (Figs. 309 and
342), a silicon nitride film 2340 is deposited as a sixth
insulating film to a thickness of about 5 to 50 nm. The
silicon nitride film 2340 is etched by anisotropic etching, for
example, to remain in the form of a sidewall spacer on the
sidewalls of the silicon nitride film 2330, the polysilicon film
2540, the silicon nitride film 2325 and the silicon oxide film
2415 (Figs. 310 and 343). At this time, the silicon oxide film
2415 containing the impurities (the first insulating film) is
isolated from other films than the island-like semiconductor
layer 2110 by the silicon nitride film 2325 (the fourth
insulating film), the silicon nitride film 2315 (the second
insulating film) and the silicon nitride film 2340 (the sixth
insulating film). </p>
    <p num="0417">Then, using the silicon nitride films 2330 and 2340
as a mask, successively etched are the silicon nitride film
2315, the silicon oxide film 2424, the silicon nitride film 2324,
the silicon oxide film 2414, the silicon nitride film 2314, the
silicon oxide film 2423, the silicon nitride film 2323, the
silicon oxide film 2413, the silicon nitride film 2313, the
silicon oxide film 2422, the silicon nitride film 2322, the
silicon oxide film 2412 and the silicon nitride film 2312,
thereby exposing the silicon oxide film 2421 (the third
insulating film). Thus, a third trench 2230 is formed (Figs.
311 and 344).</p>
    <p num="0418">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 2342 is deposited
as a sixth insulating film to a thickness of about 5 to 50 nm.
Then, the silicon nitride film 2342 is arranged such that at
least the silicon oxide film 2412 containing the impurities is
isolated from other films than the island-like semiconductor
layer 2110 by the silicon nitride film 2342 (the sixth
insulating film), the silicon nitride film 2312 (the second
insulating film) and the silicon nitride film 2322 (the fourth
insulating film). For example, the silicon nitride film 2342
deposited to a thickness of about 5 to 50 nm is
anisotropically etched back to remove the silicon nitride film
2342 located at the bottom of the third trench 2230, thereby
exposing the silicon oxide film 2421 (Figs. 312 and 345).</p>
    <p num="0419">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 2432, for example, is
deposited as a seventh insulating film to a desired thickness
and embedded in the third trench 2230 such that the silicon
oxide film 2412 containing the impurities is buried with
intervention of the silicon nitride film 2342 (Figs. 313 and 
345).</p>
    <p num="0420">Using the silicon oxide film 2432 as a mask, an
exposed portion of the silicon nitride film 2342 is removed by
isotropic etching while leaving an unexposed portion thereof
(Figs. 314 and 347).</p>
    <p num="0421">Then, a silicon oxide film 2443, for example, is
deposited as an eighth insulating film and buried in the third
trench 2230 by anisotropic etching, for example, such that
the silicon oxide film 2443 is disposed on the side of the
silicon oxide film 2422 (Figs. 315 and 348). At this time, the
depth of the buried silicon oxide film 2443 (the eighth
insulating film) is so controlled that the side of the silicon
oxide film (the first insulating film) 2413 containing the
impurities is exposed.</p>
    <p num="0422">Then, in the same manner as the above, a silicon
nitride film 2343 is deposited as a sixth insulating film to a
thickness of about 5 to 50 nm and arranged such that at least
the silicon oxide film 2413 (the first insulating film)
containing the impurities is isolated from other films than the
island-like semiconductor layer 2110 by the silicon nitride
film 2343 (the sixth insulating film), the silicon nitride film
2313 (the second insulating film) and the silicon nitride film
2323 (the fourth insulating film). Thereafter, in the same
manner as the above, a silicon oxide film 2444, for example,
is deposited as an eighth insulating film and buried in the
third trench 2230, for example, by anisotropic etching such
that the silicon oxide film 2444 is disposed on the side of the
silicon oxide film 2423 (Figs. 316 and 349).</p>
    <p num="0423">Further, in the same manner as the above, a silicon 
nitride film 2344 is deposited as a sixth insulating film to a
thickness of about 5 to 50 nm and arranged such that at least
the silicon oxide film 2414 (the first insulating film)
containing the impurities is isolated from other films than the
island-like semiconductor layer 2110 by the silicon nitride
film 2344 (the sixth insulating film), the silicon nitride film
2314 (the second insulating film) and the silicon nitride film
2324 (the fourth insulating film) (Figs. 317 and 350).</p>
    <p num="0424">Thereafter, the silicon oxide films 2442, 2443 and
2444 (the eighth insulating films), the silicon oxide films 2421,
2422, 2423 and 2424 (the third insulating films) and the
silicon oxide films 2432, 2433 and 2434 (the seventh
insulating films) are removed by isotropic etching, for
example, thereby exposing the sides of the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 (Figs. 318 and 351).</p>
    <p num="0425">Then, the surface of each island-like semiconductor
layer 2110 is oxidized to form, for example, a thermally
oxidized film 2450 of about 10 to 100 nm thick as a ninth
insulating film (Figs. 319 and 352).</p>
    <p num="0426">Next, the thermally oxidized film (the ninth
insulating film) 2450 is etched away from the periphery of
each island-like semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by
isotropic etching (Figs. 320 and 353).</p>
    <p num="0427">Then, as required, channel ion implantation is
carried out into the sidewall of each island semiconductor
layer 2110 by slant ion implantation. For example, the ion
implantation may be performed at an implantation energy of 5
to 100 keV at a boron dose of about 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 1 ×
10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of 5 to 45° with respect to the normal 
line of the surface of the substrate. Preferably the channel
ion implantation is performed from various directions to the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110 because a surface
impurity concentration becomes more uniform. Alternatively,
instead of the channel ion implantation, an oxide film
containing boron may be deposited by CVD with a view to
utilizing diffusion of boron from the oxide film. The impurity
implantation from the surface of the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 may be carried out before the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110 are covered with the
thermally oxidized film 2450, or during the formation of the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110. Alternatively, the
impurities may be introduced to the silicon oxide films 2421,
2422, 2423 and 2424 in advance with a view to implanting
the impurities in the island-like semiconductor layers 2110
by thermal treatment or the like before removing the silicon
oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423 and 2424. Means for the
implantation are not particularly limited so long as an
impurity concentration distribution is almost equal over the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110.</p>
    <p num="0428">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2460, for example,
is formed as a tenth insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film
to a thickness of about 10 nm around each island-like
semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by thermal
oxidization (Fig. 321 and Fig. 354). The tunnel oxide film,
however, may be formed of not only a thermally oxidized film
but also a CVD oxide film or a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0429">Then, a polysilicon film 2510, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50 
to 200 nm. Using the silicon nitride film 2330 (the fifth
insulating film) and the silicon nitride films 2340, 2342, 2343
and 2344 (the sixth insulating films) as a mask, the
polysilicon film 2510 is divided into polysilicon films 2511,
2512, 2513 and 2514 (first conductive films), for example, by
anisotropic etching (Figs. 322 and 355).</p>
    <p num="0430">A silicon oxide film 2470, for example, is then
deposited to a thickness of about 50 to 500 nm as an eleventh
insulating film.</p>
    <p num="0431">The silicon oxide film 2470 is buried in the third
trench 2230, for example, by anisotropic or isotropic etching,
such that the polysilicon film 2511 (the first conductive film)
is buried (Figs. 323 and 356). At this time, the depth of the
buried silicon oxide film 2470 is so controlled that the silicon
nitride film 2342 (the sixth insulating film) is partially
exposed.</p>
    <p num="0432">Then, a silicon nitride film 2350, for example, is
deposited as a twelfth insulating film to a thickness of 5 to 50
nm on the surfaces the polysilicon films 2512 to 2514 (the
first conductive films), the silicon nitride films 2340, 2342,
2343 and 2344 (the sixth insulating films) and the silicon
oxide film 2470 (the eleventh insulating film) which are
present on the inner wall of the third trench 2230. The
silicon nitride film 2350 is then etched back anisotropically,
for example, to remain in the form of a sidewall spacer (Figs.
324 and 357).</p>
    <p num="0433">Then, the silicon oxide film 2470 is etched back by
isotropic etching, for example, to such a degree that the side
of the polysilicon film 2511 (the first conductive film) is 
exposed (Figs. 325 and 358).</p>
    <p num="0434">Then, a polysilicon film 2521, for example, is
deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness of 15 to
150 nm (Figs. 326 and 359).</p>
    <p num="0435">The polysilicon film 2521 is then etched back, for
example, anisotropically, as shown in Fig. 360.
Subsequently, the silicon nitride film 2321 (the fourth
insulating film), the silicon oxide film 2411 (the first
insulating film) and the P-type silicon substrate 2100 are
successively etched to form a second trench 2200 in the
P-type silicon substrate 2100 in self-alignment with the
polysilicon film 2521 (the second conductive film), thereby
separating the impurity diffusion layer 2710. That is, a
separation portion of the first wiring layer is formed in
self-alignment with a separation portion of the second
conductive film (Fig. 327 and Fig. 360).</p>
    <p num="0436">Then, a silicon oxide film 2470, for example, is
deposited to a thickness of 30 to 300 nm as an eleventh
insulating film and etched back anisotropically to be buried
in the second trench 2220. At this time, the height of the
silicon oxide film 2470 is so adjusted that the polysilicon film
2511 (the first conductive film) is embedded (Figs. 328 and
361).</p>
    <p num="0437">Subsequently, the polysilicon film 2521 is etched
back anisotropically or isotropically to such a degree that the
polysilicon film 2521 is able to contact the polysilicon film
2511 to form a selection gate (Figs. 329 and 362). At this
time, by setting the intervals between the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a 
predetermined value or smaller, the polysilicon film 2521 is
formed into a second wiring layer to be a selection gate line
continuous in the direction without need to use a masking
process.</p>
    <p num="0438">Then, the sidewall spacer made of the silicon nitride
film (the twelfth insulating film) 2350 is removed by isotropic
etching (Figs. 330 and 363) and a silicon oxide film 2471, for
example, is deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a
thickness of about 50 to 500 nm.</p>
    <p num="0439">The silicon oxide film 2471 is buried in the third
trench 2230 by anisotropic or isotropic etching such that the
polysilicon film 2521 is embedded. At this time, the depth of
the buried silicon oxide film 2471 is so controlled that the
silicon nitride film 2342 is partially exposed.</p>
    <p num="0440">Subsequently, an interlayer insulating film 2612 is
formed on exposed surfaces of the polysilicon films 2512 to
2514 (Fig. 331 and Fig. 364). This interlayer insulating film
2612 may be formed of an ONO film. The ONO film can be
formed in the same manner as in Production example 1.</p>
    <p num="0441">Then, in the same manner, a polysilicon film 2522 is
deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness of 15 to
150 nm and then etched back such that the polysilicon film
2522 is disposed on the side of the polysilicon film (the first
conductive film) 2512 with intervention of the interlayer
insulating film 2612. At this time, by setting the intervals
between the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 in the
direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined value or smaller,
the polysilicon film 2522 is formed into a third wiring layer to
be a control gate line continuous in the direction of A-A' 
without need to use a masking process.</p>
    <p num="0442">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 2472, for example, is
deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of
about 50 to 500 nm. The silicon oxide film 2472 is buried in
the third trench 2230, for example, by anisotropic or isotropic
etching, such that the polysilicon film (the second conductive
film) 2522 is embedded. At this time, the depth of the buried
silicon oxide film 2472 is so controlled that the silicon nitride
film 2343 is partially exposed.</p>
    <p num="0443">By repeating likewise, a polysilicon film (a second
conductive film) 2523 is disposed on the side of the
polysilicon film (a first conductive film) 2513 with
intervention of an interlayer insulating film 2613, and then a
silicon oxide film 2473 (an eleventh insulating film) is formed
to bury the polysilicon film 2523. With regard to the
polysilicon film 2514 which is the topmost first conductive
film, a polysilicon film (a second conductive film) 2524 is
etched back to such a degree that the polysilicon film 2524 is
able to contact the polysilicon film (the first conductive film)
2514, in the same manner as the polysilicon film 2511 which
is the bottommost first conductive film (Figs. 329 to 334 and
Figs. 362 to 366).</p>
    <p num="0444">Then, the silicon nitride film 2330 (the fifth
insulating film) and the silicon nitride film 2340 (the sixth
insulating film) are removed by isotropic etching, for example,
to expose the polysilicon film 2540 (Figs. 334 and 367).</p>
    <p num="0445">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2474 is deposited
as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of 100 to 500 nm
on the top of the polysilicon film 2524. The top portion of 
the polysilicon film 2540 is exposed by etch-back or by CMP.
A fourth wiring layer 2840 is formed so that its direction
crosses the direction of the second or third wiring layer and is
connected to the top portion of the island-like semiconductor
layer 2110 (Fig. 335 and Fig. 367). Fig. 335 shows that the
fourth wiring layer 2840 is placed on the polysilicon film 2540
without mis-alignment. However, even if mis-alignment
occurs, the fourth wiring layer 2840 can be connected to the
polysilicon film 2540 as shown in Fig. 336 (This is true of the
following production examples).</p>
    <p num="0446">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed. Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized
which has a memory function according to the state of a
charge in the charge storage layer which is the floating gate
made of the polysilicon film (the first conductive film).</p>
    <p num="0447">In this example, films formed on the surface of the
semiconductor substrate or the polysilicon film such as the
silicon nitride film (the fifth insulating film) 2330, the silicon
nitride film (the sixth insulating film) 2340 and the silicon
nitride film (the twelfth insulating film) 2350 may be formed
of a layered film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon nitride film
from the silicon surface.</p>
    <p num="0448">With regard to the polysilicon films 2510 or 2511 to
2514 (the first conductive films), the polysilicon films 2520 or
2521 to 2524 (the second conductive films) and the
polysilicon film 2540 (the fourth conductive film), impurity
introduction may be carried out during or after the formation
of the polysilicon films or after the separation of the 
polysilicon films. The timing of the impurity introduction to
the polysilicon films is not particularly limited so long as
these films become conductive films.</p>
    <p num="0449">In the example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a
mask. That is possible only where the island-like
semiconductor layers are not disposed symmetrically to a
diagonal. More particularly, by setting smaller the intervals
between adjacent island-like semiconductor layers in the
direction of the second or third wiring layer than those in the
direction of the fourth wiring layer, it is possible to obtain the
wiring layers which are discontinuous in the direction of the
fourth wiring layer and are continuous in the direction of the
second or third wiring layer without using a mask. In
contrast, if the island-like semiconductor layers are disposed
symmetrically to a diagonal, for example, the wiring layers
may be separated through patterning with use of resist films
by photolithography.</p>

    <p num="0450">In contrast to Production example 1, this example
shows an example of production process of a semiconductor

    <p num="0452">In this example, a separation portion of the first
wiring layer is not formed in self-alignment with a separation 
portion of the polysilicon film 2521 (the second conductive
film) by anisotropic etching. Further, the polysilicon films
2521 to 2524 (the second conductive films) are deposited to
have such a thickness that they are spontaneously separated
in a direction of B-B' in Fig. 1 and thus etching for the
separation is not required.</p>
    <p num="0453">This example is the same as Production example 11
(Figs. 369 to 372 and Figs. 375 to 378) before the silicon

on the top of the polysilicon film 2524 (Figs. 304 to 335 and
Figs. 337 to 378).</p>
    <p num="0454">Thereafter, using a resist film R4 patterned by a
known photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 373 and
379), anisotropic etching is performed to reach the P-type
silicon substrate 2100, thereby separating the impurity
diffusion layer 2710 and the polysilicon films 2521 to 2524 in
a direction of B-B'.</p>
    <p num="0455">Then, a silicon oxide film 2475 is deposited as an
eleventh insulating film and subjected to etch-back or CMP to
expose the top portion of the polysilicon film 2540 (fouth
conductive film). A fourth wiring layer 2840 is connected to
the top of the island-like semiconductor layer 2110 in such a
manner that its direction crosses the direction of the second
or third wiring layer (Fig. 379 and Fig. 380).</p>
    <p num="0456">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer

    <p num="0458">By providing the selection gates in the top and the
bottom of a set of memory cells, it is possible to prevent the
phenomenon that a memory cell transistor is over-erased, i.e.,
a reading voltage is 0V and a threshold is negative, thereby
the cell current flows even through a non-selected cell.</p>
    <p num="0459">In Production examples 11 and 12, the third
lattice-form trench 2230 is formed on the P-type

P-type impurity diffusion layer formed in an N-type impurity
diffusion layer formed in a P-type semiconductor substrate.
The conductivity types of the impurity diffusion layers may be
reversed. This production example is applicable to the
following various production examples.</p>
    <heading>Production example 13</heading>
    <p num="0460">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this
example, regions for forming charge storage layers are defined
in advance by a laminated film comprising plural films, and
then island-like semiconductor layers in a pillar form are
formed by selective epitaxial silicon growth in trenches
opened by using a photoresist mask. Tunnel oxide films and
floating gates as charge storage layers are formed on the sides
of the island-like semiconductor layers in the regions for 
forming the charge storage layers. The island-like
semiconductor layers are each in an electrically floating state
with respect to the semiconductor substrate. The active
regions of the memory cells are electrically common.</p>
    <p num="0461">In the semiconductor memory, selection gate
transistors are disposed at the top and the bottom of the
island-like semiconductor layer. A plurality of memory
transistors, for example, two memory transistors, are placed
between the selection gate transistors. The tunnel oxide film
and the floating gate of the transistors are formed at the same
time. The transistors are connected in series along the
island-like semiconductor layer. Further, the thickness of
gate insulating films of the selection gate transistors is equal
to the thickness of gate insulating films of the memory

    <p num="0462">Figs. 381 to 402 and Figs. 403 to 424 are sectional
views taken on line A-A' and line B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1
which is a plan view illustrating an EEPROM memory cell
array.</p>
    <p num="0463">First, on a surface of a P-type silicon substrate 2100,
a silicon oxide film 2411 containing arsenic impurities of
about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>22</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup>, for example, is deposited as a
first insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm by CVD.
At this time, ion implantation may be carried out to introduce
the impurities to the insulating film deposited by CVD. For
example, to the silicon oxide film 2411 deposited to a
thickness of 50 to 500 nm, ion implantation may be carried
out at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at an arsenic
dose of about 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of about 0 
to 45° with respect to the normal line of the surface of the
substrate. The impurity introduction to the silicon oxide
film 2411 by ion implantation may not necessarily be carried
out immediately after the deposition of the silicon oxide film
2411. Regarding the ion implantation to the silicon oxide
film 2411, the angle for the implantation is not particularly
limited as long as a desired impurity concentration is
obtained. Means for the impurity introduction to the silicon
oxide film 2411 is not limited to the ion implantation, but any
means such as solid vapor phase diffusion may be used.
Thereafter, a silicon nitride film 2321, for example, is
deposited as a fourth insulating film to a thickness of 10 to
100 nm. If the above-mentioned impurity introduction to the
silicon oxide film 2411 is carried out by ion implantation, the
impurities may be introduced by ion implantation through the
silicon nitride film 2321 into the silicon oxide film 2411.</p>
    <p num="0464">Then, a silicon oxide film 2421, for example, is
deposited as a third insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm, a silicon nitride film 2312, for example, is deposited
as a second insulating film to a thickness of 10 to 100 nm
and a silicon oxide film 2412 is deposited as a first insulating
film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm. After the films are thus
formed sequentially, a silicon oxide film 2415, for example, is
deposited as a first insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500
nm and a silicon nitride film 2325 is deposited as a fourth
insulating film to a thickness of 500 to 5,000 nm as shown in
Figs. 381 and 403.</p>
    <p num="0465">Subsequently, using a resist film R1 patterned by a
known photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 381 and 
403), reactive ion etching, for example, is performed to
successively etch the silicon nitride film 2325, the silicon
oxide film 2415, the silicon nitride film 2315, the silicon
oxide film 2424, the silicon nitride film 2314, the silicon
oxide film 2423, the silicon nitride film 2313, the silicon
oxide film 2422, the silicon nitride film 2312, the silicon
oxide film 2421, the silicon nitride film 2321 and the silicon
oxide film 2411, thereby forming a fourth trench 2240 (Figs.
382 and 404).</p>
    <p num="0466">The resist film R1 is removed and then island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 are filled in the fourth trench
2240. For example, the island-like semiconductor layers
2110 are formed by selective epitaxial growth from the P-type
silicon substrate 2100 located at the bottom of the fourth
trench 2240 (Figs. 383 and 405).</p>
    <p num="0467">The thus formed island-like semiconductor layers
2110 are flattened to be flush with the silicon nitride film
2325 (Figs. 384 and 406). The flattening may be carried out
by isotropic or anisotropic etch-back, CMP, or a combination
in various ways. Thereafter, a polysilicon film 2540, for
example, is deposited as a fourth conductive film to a
thickness of about 100 to 300 nm and a silicon nitride film
2330 is deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of
about 200 to 2,000 nm.</p>
    <p num="0468">Then, using a resist film R2 patterned by a known
photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 385 and 407),
reactive ion etching, for example, is performed to successively
etch the silicon nitride film 2330, the polysilicon film 2540,
the silicon nitride film 2325 and the silicon oxide film 2415, 
thereby exposing the silicon nitride film 2315 (the second
insulating film). At this time, the silicon nitride film 2315
may be etched until the silicon oxide film 2424 (the third
insulating film) is exposed.</p>
    <p num="0469">After the resist film R2 is removed (Figs. 386 and
408), a silicon nitride film 2340 is deposited as a sixth
insulating film to a thickness of about 5 to 50 nm. Then, the
silicon nitride film 2340 is etched by anisotropic etching, for
example, to remain in the form of a sidewall spacer on the
sidewalls of the silicon nitride film 2330, the polysilicon film
2540, the silicon nitride film 2325 and the silicon oxide film
2415 (Figs. 387 and 309). At this time, the silicon oxide film
2415 containing the impurities (the first insulating film) is
isolated from other films than the island-like semiconductor
layer 2110 by the silicon nitride film 2325 (the fourth
insulating film), the silicon nitride film 2315 (the second
insulating film) and the silicon nitride film 2340 (the sixth
insulating film).</p>
    <p num="0470">Then, using the silicon nitride films 2330 and 2340
as a mask, successively etched are the silicon nitride film
2315, the silicon oxide film 2424, the silicon nitride film 2314,
the silicon oxide film 2423, the silicon nitride film 2313, the
silicon oxide film 2422, the silicon nitride film 2312 and the
silicon oxide film 2421, thereby exposing the silicon nitride
film 2321. Thus, a third trench 2230 is formed (Figs. 388
and 410).</p>
    <p num="0471">Thereafter, the silicon oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423
and 2424 (the third insulating films) are removed by isotropic
etching, for example, to expose the sides of the island-like 
semiconductor layers 2110. Then, the surface of each
island-like semiconductor layer 2110 is oxidized to form, for
example, a thermally oxidized film 2450 of about 10 to 100
nm thick as a ninth insulating film (Figs. 389 and 411).</p>
    <p num="0472">Next, the thermally oxidized film (the ninth
insulating film) 2450 is etched away from the periphery of
each island-like semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by
isotropic etching (Figs. 390 and 412). Then, as required,
channel ion implantation is carried out into the sidewall of
each island semiconductor layer 2110 by slant ion
implantation. For example, the ion implantation may be
performed at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at a
boron dose of about 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> and at an
angle of 5 to 45° with respect to the normal line of the
surface of the substrate. Preferably the channel ion
implantation is performed from various directions to the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110 because a surface
impurity concentration becomes more uniform. Alternatively,
instead of the channel ion implantation, an oxide film
containing boron may be deposited by CVD with a view to
utilizing diffusion of boron from the oxide film. The impurity
implantation from the surface of the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 may be carried out before the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110 are covered with the
thermally oxidized film 2450, or during the formation of the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110. Alternatively, the
impurities may be introduced to the silicon oxide films 2421,
2422, 2423 and 2424 in advance with a view to implanting
the impurities in the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 
by thermal treatment or the like before removing the silicon
oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423 and 2424. Means for the
implantation are not particularly limited so long as an
impurity concentration distribution is almost equal over the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110.</p>
    <p num="0473">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2460, for example,
is formed as a tenth insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film
to a thickness of about 10 nm around each island-like
semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by thermal
oxidization (Fig. 391 and Fig. 413). The tunnel oxide film,
however, may be formed of not only a thermally oxidized film
but also a CVD oxide film or a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0474">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 2510, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50
to 200 nm. Using the silicon nitride film 2330 (the fifth
insulating film) and the silicon nitride films 2340, 2314, 2313
and 2312 (the sixth insulating films) as a mask, the
polysilicon film 2510 is divided into polysilicon films 2511,
2512, 2513 and 2514, for example, by anisotropic etching
(Figs. 392 and 414).</p>
    <p num="0475">A silicon oxide film 2470, for example, is then
deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of
about 50 to 500 nm. The silicon oxide film 2470 is buried in
the third trench 2230, for example, by anisotropic and
isotropic etching such that the polysilicon film 2511 (the first
conductive film) is embedded (Figs. 393 and 415). At this
time, the depth of the buried silicon oxide film 2470 is so
controlled that the silicon nitride film 2312 (the second
insulating film) is partially exposed. Then, a silicon nitride 
film 2350, for example, is deposited as a twelfth insulating
film to a thickness of 5 to 50 nm on the surfaces of the
polysilicon films 2512 to 2514 (the first conductive films), the
silicon nitride films 2312, 2313, 2314 and 2315 (the sixth
insulating films) and the silicon oxide film 2470 (the eleventh
insulating film) which are present on the inner wall of the
third trench 2230. For example, the silicon nitride film 2350
is etched back anisotropically, for example, to remain in the
form of a sidewall spacer (Figs. 394 and 416).</p>
    <p num="0476">Then, the silicon oxide film 2470 is etched back
isotropically, for example, to such a degree that the side of
the polysilicon film 2511 is exposed (Figs. 395 and 417).</p>
    <p num="0477">Then, a polysilicon film 2521, for example, is
deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness of 15 to
150 nm (Figs. 396 and 418).</p>
    <p num="0478">The polysilicon film 2521 is then etched back
anisotropically, for example, as shown in Fig. 491.
Subsequently, the silicon nitride film 2321 (the fourth
insulating film), the silicon oxide film 2411 (the first
insulating film) and the P-type silicon substrate 2100 are
successively etched to form a second trench 2200 in the
P-type silicon substrate 2100 in self-alignment with the
polysilicon film 2521 (the second conductive film), thereby
separating the impurity diffusion layer 2710. That is, a
separation portion of the first wiring layer is formed in
self-alignment with a separation portion of the second
conductive film (Fig. 397 and Fig. 419).</p>
    <p num="0479">Then, a silicon oxide film 2470, for example, is
deposited to a thickness of 30 to 300 nm as an eleventh 
insulating film and buried in the second trench 2220 by, for
example, anisotropic etching. The height of the silicon oxide
film 2470 is so adjusted that the polysilicon film 2511 (the
first conductive film) is buried. Subsequently, the
polysilicon film 2521 is etched back anisotropically or
isotropically to such a degree that the polysilicon film 2521 is
able to contact the polysilicon film 2511 to form a selection
gate. At this time, by setting the intervals between the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110 in a direction of A-A' in
Fig. 1 to a predetermined value or smaller, the polysilicon
film 2521 is formed into a second wiring layer to be a
selection gate line continuous in the direction without need to
use a masking process.</p>
    <p num="0480">Then, the sidewall spacer made of the silicon nitride
film (the twelfth insulating film) 2350 is removed by isotropic
etching and a silicon oxide film 2471, for example, is
deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of
about 50 to 500 nm.</p>
    <p num="0481">The silicon oxide film 2471 is buried in the third

nitride film 2342 is partially exposed.</p>
    <p num="0482">Subsequently, an interlayer insulating film 2612 is
formed on exposed surfaces of the polysilicon films 2512 to
2514 (Fig. 398 and Fig. 420). This interlayer insulating film
2612 may be formed of an ONO film, for example. The ONO
film may be formed in the same manner as in Production
example 11. </p>
    <p num="0483">Subsequently, in the same manner, a polysilicon film
2522 is deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness
of 15 to 150 nm and then etched back so that the polysilicon
film 2522 is disposed on the side of the polysilicon film (the
first conductive film) 2512 with intervention of the interlayer
insulating film 2612. At this time, by setting the intervals
between the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 in the
direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined value or smaller,
the polysilicon film 2522 is formed into a third wiring layer to
be a control gate line continuous in the direction of A-A'
without need to use a masking process (Figs. 399 and 421).</p>

embedded to bury the polysilicon film 2523 (Figs. 400 and

    <p num="0487">With regard to the polysilicon film 2514 which is the
topmost first conductive film, a polysilicon film (a second

(the first conductive film) 2514, in the same manner as the
polysilicon film 2511 which is the bottommost first conductive
film (Figs. 399 to 401 and Figs. 421 to 423).</p>
    <p num="0488">Then, the silicon nitride film 2330 (the fifth

a thickness of 100 to 500 nm on the top of the polysilicon film
2524. The top portion of the polysilicon film 2540 is exposed
by etch-back or by CMP. A fourth wiring layer 2840 is
formed so that its direction crosses the direction of the

    <p num="0494">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this
example, regions for forming charge storage layers are defined
in advance by a laminated film comprising plural films, and
then island-like semiconductor layers in a pillar form are
formed by selective epitaxial silicon growth in trenches
opened by using a photoresist mask. Laminated insulating 
films as charge storage layers are formed on the sides of the
island-like semiconductor layers in the regions for forming
the charge storage layers. The island-like semiconductor
layers are each in an electrically floating state with respect to
the semiconductor substrate. The active regions of the

    <p num="0495">In the semiconductor memory, selection gate
transistors are disposed at the top and the bottom of the

transistors, for example, two memory transistors, are placed
between the selection gate transistors. The laminated
insulating films of the memory transistors are formed at the

    <p num="0497">In this example, production steps are the same as
those in Production Example 13 (Figs. 381 to 390 and Figs.
403 to 412) before the formation of the thermally oxidized film
2450 of 10 to 100 nm thick as the ninth insulating film by the

2110 and the removal of the thermally oxidized film 2450 by
isotropic etching from the periphery of the island-like

    <p num="0498">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2496, for example,
is deposited as a twenty-fourth insulating film to a thickness
of 50 to 500 nm by CVD and is etched back to such a degree
that the silicon nitride film 2312 (the second insulating film)
is exposed, thereby burying the silicon oxide film 2496 (Figs.

    <p num="0499">A laminated insulating film 2620 to be a charge

of each island-like semiconductor layer 2110, the silicon
nitride film 2340 (the sixth insulating film) and the silicon
nitride films 2313 to 2315 (the second insulating films) (Figs.
427 and 440). In order to form a laminated insulating film of
a MNOS structure, a silicon nitride film of 4 to 10 nm
thickness and a silicon oxide film of 2 to 5 nm thickness may
be formed sequentially on the surface of the island-like
semiconductor layer 2110 by CVD. Alternatively, a silicon
nitride film of 4 to 10 nm thickness is deposited on the
surface of the island-like semiconductor layer by CVD and the
surface of the silicon nitride film may be oxidized to form a
silicon oxide film of 2 to 5 nm thickness. Further, in order
to form a laminated insulating film of a MONOS structure, a
silicon oxide film of 2 to 5 nm thickness, a silicon nitride film
of 4 to 8 nm thickness and a silicon oxide film of 2 to 5 nm
thickness are sequentially deposited on the surface of the

CVD on the surface of the island-like semiconductor layer
2110, and then the surface of the silicon nitride film may be 
oxidized to form a silicon oxide film of 2 to 5 nm thickness, or
alternatively, the surface of the island-like semiconductor
layer may be oxidized to form a silicon oxide film of 2 to 5 nm
thickness. These processes may be combined in any way.</p>
    <p num="0500">Then, a polysilicon film 2510, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50
to 500 nm (Figs. 428 and 441).</p>
    <p num="0501">Using the silicon nitride film 2330 (the fifth

film 2510 (the first conductive film) is divided into polysilicon
films 2512, 2513 and 2514 by, for example, anisotropic
etching (Figs. 429 and 442).</p>
    <p num="0502">Then, the silicon oxide film 2496 is removed to
expose the island-like semiconductor layer 2110. Further, a
silicon oxide film 2491 is formed as an eighteenth insulating
film to be a selection gate oxide film to a thickness of about
10 nm by, for example, thermal oxidization. The eighteenth
insulating film, however, may be formed of not only a
thermally oxidized film but also a CVD oxide film or a
nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0503">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 2521, for example, is
deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness of 15 to
150 nm.</p>
    <p num="0504">As shown in Fig. 443, the polysilicon film 2521 is
then etched back by anisotropic etching (Figs. 430 and 443).</p>
    <p num="0505">Then, the silicon nitride film 2321 (the fourth
insulating film), the silicon oxide film 2411 (the first 
insulating film) and the P-type silicon substrate 2100 are
successively etched to form a second trench 2200 in the
P-type silicon substrate 2100 in self-alignment with the
polysilicon film 2521 (the second conductive film), thereby
separating the impurity diffusion layer 2710. That is, a
separation portion of the first wiring layer is formed in
self-alignment with a separation portion of the second
conductive film. It is also possible that the polysilicon film
2521 is anisotropically etched back at least from the bottom
surface of the first conductive film 2512 and a silicon oxide
film is buried therein by CVD only in the direction in which
the intervals between the island-like semiconductor layers
2110 are smaller, and then the second trench 2220 may be
opened in self-alignment using the silicon oxide film as a
mask.</p>
    <p num="0506">Subsequently, the polysilicon film 2521 is etched
back to such a degree that the polysilicon film 2521 is able to
contact the polysilicon film 2511 to form a selection gate. At
this time, by setting the intervals between the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 12 to
a predetermined value or smaller, the polysilicon film 2521 is
formed into a second wiring layer to be a selection gate line
continuous in the direction without need to use a masking
process.</p>
    <p num="0507">Then, a silicon oxide film 2471, for example, is
buried as an eleventh insulating film. At this time, the
silicon oxide film 2471 is so buried that at least the
polysilicon film 2512 (the first conductive film) is exposed
(Figs. 423 and 445). </p>
    <p num="0508">Subsequently, in the same manner, a polysilicon film
(a second conductive film) 2522 is deposited to a thickness of
15 to 150 nm and etched back so that the polysilicon film
2522 is disposed on the side of the polysilicon film (the first
conductive film) 2512. A silicon oxide film 2472 is formed as
an eleventh insulating film so that at least the polysilicon film
2513 (the first conductive film) is exposed. By repeating
likewise, a polysilicon film 2523 is deposited as a second
conductive film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm and etched
back to remain on the side of the polysilicon film 2513.</p>
    <p num="0509">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 2473, for example, is
buried as an eleventh insulating film. At this time, the
silicon oxide film 2473 is so buried that at least the
polysilicon film 2514 (the first conductive film) is exposed
(Figs. 434 and 447).</p>
    <p num="0510">Then, the polysilicon film 2514 and the laminated
insulating film 2620 which is not covered with the silicon
oxide film 2473 are removed, thereby exposing the island-like

    <p num="0511">Further, a silicon oxide film 2492, for example, is
formed as an eighteenth insulating film to be a selection gate
oxide film to a thickness of about 10 nm, for example, by
thermal oxidation (Figs. 435 and 448). The eighteenth
insulating film, however, may be formed of not only a
thermally oxidized film but also a CVD oxide film or a
nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0512">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 2524 is deposited as
a second conductive film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm, and
then etched back. A silicon oxide film 2474 is deposited as 
an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of 100 to 500 nm
on the top of the polysilicon film 2524, and then etched back
to a level lower than the top surface of the polysilicon film
2540 (Figs. 436 and 449).</p>
    <p num="0513">Subsequently, the silicon nitride film 2330 (the fifth
insulating film) and the silicon nitride film 2340 (the sixth
insulating film) are removed by anisotropic etching, for
example, to expose the polysilicon film 2540 (the fourth
conductive film). The top portion of the polysilicon film 2540
is exposed by etch-back or by CMP. A fourth wiring layer
2840 is formed so that its direction crosses the direction of
the second or third wiring layer and is connected to the top
portion of the island-like semiconductor layer 2110 (Fig. 437
and Fig. 450).</p>
    <p num="0514">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed. Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized
which has a memory function according to the state of a
charge in the charge storage layer which is the floating gate
made of the polysilicon film (the first conductive film).</p>
    <p num="0515">In this example, films formed on the surface of the

of a layered film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon nitride film
from the silicon surface.</p>
    <p num="0516">With regard to the polysilicon films 2510 or 2512 to
2514 (the first conductive films), the polysilicon films 2520 or

introduction may be carried out during or after the formation
of the polysilicon films or after the separation of the

    <p num="0541">First, on a surface of a P-type silicon substrate 2100,
a silicon oxide film 2411 containing arsenic impurities of
about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>22</sup> /cm<sup>3</sup>, for example, is deposited as a
first insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm by CVD.
At this time, ion implantation may be carried out to introduce
the impurities to the insulating film deposited by CVD. For
example, to the silicon oxide film 2411 deposited to a
thickness of 50 to 500 nm, ion implantation may be carried
out at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at an arsenic
dose of about 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of about 0
to 45° with respect to the normal line of the surface of the
substrate. The impurity introduction to the silicon oxide
film 2411 by ion implantation may not necessarily be carried
out immediately after the deposition of the silicon oxide film 
2411. Regarding the ion implantation to the silicon oxide
film 2411, the angle for the implantation is not particularly
limited as long as a desired impurity concentration is
obtained. Means for the impurity introduction to the silicon
oxide film 2411 is not limited to the ion implantation, but any
means such as solid or vapor phase diffusion may be used.</p>
    <p num="0542">Thereafter, a silicon nitride film 2321, for example, is
deposited as a fourth insulating film to a thickness of 10 to

silicon oxide film 2411 is carried out by ion implantation, the
impurities may be introduced by ion implantation through the
silicon nitride film 2321 into the silicon oxide film 2411.</p>
    <p num="0543">Then, a silicon oxide film 2421, for example, is
deposited as a third insulating film to a thickness of 50 to

thickness of 50 to 500 nm, a silicon nitride film 2322 is
deposited as a fourth insulating film to a thickness of 10 to
100 nm, and a silicon oxide film 2422 is deposited as a third

containing the impurities is deposited as a first insulating
film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm and a silicon nitride film
2323 is deposited as a fourth insulating film to a thickness of
500 to 5,000 nm.</p>
    <p num="0544">Subsequently, using a resist film R1 patterned by a

    <p num="0545">The resist film R1 is removed and then island-like

the silicon nitride film 2323 and the silicon oxide film 2413,
thereby exposing the silicon nitride film 2313 (the second

example, to remain in the form of a sidewall spacer on the
sidewalls of the silicon nitride film 2330, the polysilicon film
2540, the silicon nitride film 2323 and the silicon oxide film
2413 (Figs. 465 and 491). At this time, the silicon oxide film

isolated from other films than the island-like semiconductor
layer 2110 by the silicon nitride film 2323 (the fourth
insulating film), the silicon nitride film 2313 (the second

    <p num="0551">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 2342 is deposited
as a sixth insulating film to a thickness of about 5 to 50 nm.
Then, the silicon nitride film 2342 is arranged such that at
least the silicon oxide film 2412 containing the impurities is

insulating film) and the silicon nitride film 2322 (the fourth
insulating film). For example, the silicon nitride film 2342
deposited to a thickness of about 5 to 50 nm is removed from
the bottom of the third trench 2230 by anisotropic etching,
thereby exposing the silicon oxide film 2421 (Figs. 467 and
493).</p>
    <p num="0552">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 2432, for example, is
deposited as a seventh insulating film to a desired thickness
and buried in the third trench 2230 such that the silicon
oxide film 2412 containing the impurities is buried with
intervention of the silicon nitride film 2342 (Figs. 468 and
494).</p>
    <p num="0553">Using the silicon oxide film 2432 as a mask, an
exposed portion of the silicon nitride film 2342 is removed by
isotropic etching, while leaving an unexposed portion thereof
(Figs. 469 and 495).</p>
    <p num="0554">Thereafter, the silicon oxide films 2421 and 2422
(the third insulating films) and the silicon oxide film 2432
(the seventh insulating film) are removed by isotropic etching,
for example, to expose the sides of the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 (Figs. 470 and 496).</p>
    <p num="0555">Then, the periphery of each island-like
semiconductor layer 2110 is oxidized to form, for example, a
thermally oxidized film 2450 of about 10 to 100 nm thick as a
ninth insulating film (Figs. 471 and 497).</p>
    <p num="0556">Next, the thermally oxidized film (the ninth 
insulating film) 2450 is etched away from the periphery of
each island-like semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by
isotropic etching (Figs. 472 and 498). Then, as required,
channel ion implantation is carried out into the sidewall of
the island semiconductor layer 2110 by slant ion
implantation. For example, the ion implantation may be
performed at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at a
boron dose of about 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of
5 to 45° with respect to the normal line of the surface of the
substrate. Preferably the channel ion implantation is
performed from various directions to the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 because a surface impurity
concentration becomes more uniform. Alternatively, instead
of the channel ion implantation, an oxide film containing
boron may be deposited by CVD with a view to utilizing
diffusion of boron from the oxide film. The impurity
implantation from the surface of the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 may be carried out before the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110 are covered with the
thermally oxidized film 2450, or during the formation of the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110. Alternatively, the
impurities may be introduced to the silicon oxide films 2421
and 2422 in advance with a view to implanting the impurities
in the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 by thermal
treatment or the like before removing the silicon oxide films
2421 and 2422. Means for the implantation are not
particularly limited so long as an impurity concentration
distribution is almost equal over the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110. </p>
    <p num="0557">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2460, for example,
is formed as a tenth insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film
to a thickness of about 10 nm around each island-like
semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by thermal
oxidization (Fig. 473 and Fig. 499). The tunnel oxide film,
however, may be formed of not only a thermally oxidized film
but also a CVD oxide film or a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0558">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 2510, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50
to 200 nm. Using the silicon nitride film 2330 (the fifth
insulating film) and the silicon nitride films 2340 and 2342
(the sixth insulating films) as a mask, the polysilicon film
2510 is divided into polysilicon films 2511 and 2512, for
example, by anisotropic etching (Figs. 474 and 500).</p>
    <p num="0559">Subsequently, an interlayer insulating film 2612 is
formed on exposed surfaces of the polysilicon films 2511 to
2512 (Fig. 475 and Fig. 501). This interlayer insulating film
2612 may be formed of an ONO film, for example. The ONO
film may be formed in the same manner as in Production
example 1.</p>
    <p num="0560">The interlayer insulating film 2612 is anisotropically
etched to expose the silicon nitride film 2321 (Figs. 476 and
502), and then a polysilicon film (a second conductive film)
2521, for example, is deposited to a thickness of 15 to 150
nm. The polysilicon film 2521 may be deposited without
performing the etch-back of the interlayer insulating film
2612.</p>
    <p num="0561">Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 503, the polysilicon film
2521 (the second conductive film) is etched back, for example, 
by anisotropic etching (Figs. 477 and 503).</p>
    <p num="0562">Subsequently, the silicon nitride film 2321 (the
fourth insulating film), the silicon oxide film 2411 (the first
insulating film) and the P-type silicon substrate 2100 are
successively etched to form a second trench 2200 in the
P-type silicon substrate 2100 in self-alignment with the
polysilicon film 2521 (the second conductive film), thereby
separating the impurity diffusion layer 2710. That is, a
separation portion of the first wiring layer is formed in
self-alignment with a separation portion of the second
conductive film (Fig. 478 and Fig. 504).</p>
    <p num="0563">Then, a silicon oxide film 2470, for example, is
deposited to a thickness of 30 to 300 nm as an eleventh
insulating film and buried in the second trench 2220 by
anisotropic etch-back (Figs. 479 and 505) such that the
polysilicon film 2521 (the second conductive film) is
embedded by the silicon oxide film 2470. At this time, by
setting the intervals between the island-like semiconductor
layers 2110 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined
value or smaller, the polysilicon film 2521 is formed into a
third wiring layer to be a control gate line continuous in the
direction without need to use a masking process.</p>
    <p num="0564">Thereafter, the interlayer insulating film 2610 which
is not embedded by the silicon oxide film 2470 is etched away
(Figs. 480 and 506).</p>
    <p num="0565">In the same manner, an interlayer insulating film
2613 is formed on the exposed surface of the polysilicon film
2512 (Figs. 481 and 507). Then a polysilicon film 2522 is
deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness of 15 to 
150 nm and anisotropically etched back such that the
polysilicon film 2522 is disposed on the side of the polysilicon
film (the first conductive film) 2512 with intervention of the
interlayer insulating film 2613 (Figs. 482 and 508).</p>
    <p num="0566">Then, the interlayer insulating film 2613, the silicon
nitride film 2330 (the fifth insulating film) and the silicon
nitride film 2340 (the sixth insulating film) are removed by,
for example, isotropic etching to expose the polysilicon film
2540 (Figs. 483 and 509).</p>
    <p num="0567">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2472 is deposited
as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of 100 to 500 nm
on the top of the polysilicon film 2522. The top portion of
the polysilicon film 2540 is exposed by etch-back or by CMP.
A fourth wiring layer 2840 is formed so that its direction
crosses the direction of the second or third wiring layer and is
connected to the top portion of the island-like semiconductor
layer 2110.</p>
    <p num="0568">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed (Figs. 484 and 510). Thereby, a semiconductor
memory is realized which has a memory function according to
the state of a charge in the charge storage layer which is the
floating gate made of the polysilicon film (the first conductive
film).</p>
    <p num="0569">In this example, films formed on the surface of the
semiconductor substrate or the polysilicon film such as the
silicon nitride film (the fifth insulating film) 2330 and the
silicon nitride film (the sixth insulating film) 2340 may be
formed of a layered film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon 
nitride film from the silicon surface.</p>
    <p num="0570">With regard to the polysilicon films 2510 or 2511 to
2512 (the first conductive films), the polysilicon films 2521 to
2522 (the second conductive films) and the polysilicon film
2540 (the fourth conductive film), impurity introduction may
be carried out during or after the formation of the polysilicon
films or after the separation of the polysilicon films. The
timing of the impurity introduction to the polysilicon films is
not particularly limited so long as these films become
conductive films.</p>
    <p num="0571">In the example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a

are disposed symmetrically to a diagonal, for example, the
wiring layers may be separated through patterning with use of
resist films by photolithography.</p>
    <p num="0572">Further, by providing the selection gates in the top

in advance by a laminated film comprising plural films, and
then island-like semiconductor layers in a pillar form are
formed by selective epitaxial silicon growth in trenches

floating gates as charge storage layers are formed on the sides
of the island-like semiconductor layers in the regions for
forming the charge storage layers. The island-like
semiconductor layers are each in an electrically floating state
with respect to the semiconductor substrate. The active
regions of the memory cells are electrically common.
Selection gate transistors are disposed at the top and the
bottom of the island-like semiconductor layer. A plurality of
memory transistors, for example, two memory transistors, are
placed between the selection gate transistors. The tunnel
oxide film and the floating gate of the transistors are formed
at the same time. The transistors are connected in series
along the island-like semiconductor layer. The thickness of
gate insulating films of the selection gate transistors is equal
to the thickness of gate insulating films of the memory

formed. </p>
    <p num="0576">That is, after the formation of the polysilicon films

films 2612 and 2613 are removed by isotropic etching to such
an extent that the island-like semiconductor layer 2110 is
exposed between the polysilicon films 2521 and 2522. Then,
a silicon oxide film 2494 is formed as a twenty-second
insulating film by thermal oxidization on the surface of

is deposited to a thickness of half or more of the thickness of
the silicon oxide films 2412, 2413 and 2414, isotropic etching
is performed to a depth corresponding to the deposit
thickness, thereby the silicon nitride film 2341 remains only
on the sidewalls of the silicon oxide films 2412, 2413 and
2414 (Figs. 536 and 546). Thereby, the silicon oxide film
2412 containing the impurities is isolated from other films
than the island-like semiconductor layer 2110 by the silicon
nitride film 2341 (the sixth insulating film), the silicon nitride
film 2312 (the second insulating film) and the silicon nitride
film 2322 (the fourth insulating film). This is true of the
silicon oxide films 2413 and 2414 each containing the
impurities.</p>
    <p num="0611">As another process of isolating the silicon oxide films 
2412, 2413 and 2414, for example, the silicon nitride film
2341 is etched back anisotropically by using the silicon

silicon oxide film 2421 and leave the silicon nitride film 2341
on the sidewalls of the silicon oxide films 2412, 2413 and
2414.</p>
    <p num="0612">Thereafter, the silicon oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423

    <p num="0614">Next, production steps are carried out in the same

silicon nitride film 2312 are sequentially etched by using the
silicon nitride films 2330 and 2341 as a mask to expose the
silicon oxide film 2421, thereby forming the third trench 2230
(Figs. 538 and 548). The silicon oxide films 2412, 2413 and
2414 (the first insulating films) and the silicon oxide films
2421, 2422, 2423 and 2424 (the third insulating films) are 
then selectively reduced in a direction horizontal to the
semiconductor substrate surface (Figs. 539 and 549).</p>
    <p num="0615">A silicon nitride film 2341 is deposited as a sixth
insulating film to a thickness of about 25 to 250 nm (Figs.
540 and 550). The thickness of the silicon nitride film 2341
is preferably set to be half or more of the thickness of the
silicon oxide films 2412, 2413 and 2414, and to be half or
less of the thickness of the silicon oxide films 2421, 2422,
2423 and 2424. That is, it is preferred that the silicon oxide
films 2412, 2413 and 2414 are formed to have a thickness
smaller than that of the silicon oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423
and 2424, and the silicon nitride film 2341 is formed to have
a thickness larger than the half of the thickness of the silicon
oxide films 2412, 2413, 2414 and smaller than the half of the
thickness of the silicon oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423 and
2424.</p>
    <p num="0616">Thereafter, the silicon nitride film 2341 is etched
back to a depth corresponding to the deposit thickness by
isotropic etching, thereby leaving the silicon nitride film 2341
only on the sides of the silicon oxide films 2412, 2413 and
2414 (Figs. 541 and 551). Thus, the silicon oxide film 2412

film 2341 (the sixth insulating film), the silicon nitride film
2312 (the second insulating film) and the silicon nitride film

    <p num="0620">In this example, films formed on the surface of the

    <heading>Production example 21</heading>
    <p num="0624">In an example of production process for forming a
semiconductor memory in which regions for forming charge
storage layers are defined in advance by a laminated film
comprising plural films, explanation is given of an example of
production process in which vapor or solid phase diffusion is
utilized for the impurity introduction to the island-like
semiconductor layers.</p>
    <p num="0625">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by
the following production process. Figs. 553 to 573 and Figs.
574 to 594 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line
B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1 which is a plan view illustrating
an EEPROM memory cell array.</p>
    <p num="0626">First, on a surface of a P-type silicon substrate 2100,
a silicon nitride film 2321, for example, is deposited as a
fourth insulating film to a thickness of 10 to 100 nm. </p>
    <p num="0627">A silicon oxide film 2421, for example, is then
deposited as a third insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm, a silicon nitride film 2312 is deposited as a second
insulating film to a thickness of 10 to 100 nm and a silicon
oxide film 2422 is deposited as a third insulating film to a
thickness of 50 to 500 nm.</p>
    <p num="0628">After the films are sequentially formed, a silicon
oxide film 2424 is deposited to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm as
a third insulating film and a silicon nitride film 2315 is
deposited to a thickness of 20 to 200 nm as a second
insulating film as shown in Fig. 553 and 574.</p>
    <p num="0629">Subsequently, using a resist film R1 patterned by a
known photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 553 and
574), reactive ion etching, for example, is performed to
successively etch the silicon nitride film 2315, the silicon
oxide film 2424, the silicon nitride film 2314, the silicon
oxide film 2423, the silicon nitride film 2313, the silicon
oxide film 2422, the silicon nitride film 2312, the silicon
oxide film 2421 and the silicon nitride film 2321, thereby
forming a fourth trench 2240 (Figs. 554 and 575).</p>
    <p num="0630">The resist film R1 is removed and then island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 are filled in the fourth trench
2240. For example, the island-like semiconductor layers
2110 are formed by selective epitaxial growth from the P-type
silicon substrate 2100 located at the bottom of the fourth
trench 2240 (Figs. 555 and 576).</p>
    <p num="0631">The thus formed island-like semiconductor layers
2110 are flattened to be flush with the silicon nitride film
2315 (Figs. 556 and 577). The flattening may be carried out 
by isotropic or anisotropic etch-back, CMP, or a combination
of various techniques.</p>
    <p num="0632">Thereafter, a silicon nitride film 2330 is deposited as
a fifth insulating film to a thickness of about 200 to 2,000
nm.</p>
    <p num="0633">Then, using a resist film R2 patterned by a known
photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 557 and 578),
reactive ion etching, for example, is performed to successively
etch the silicon nitride film 2315, the silicon oxide film 2424,
the silicon nitride film 2314, the silicon oxide film 2423, the
silicon nitride film 2313, the silicon oxide film 2422, the
silicon nitride film 2312, the silicon oxide film 2421 and the
silicon nitride film 2321, thereby exposing the P-type silicon
substrate 2100 (Figs. 558 and 579). At this time, the silicon
nitride film 2321 may remain.</p>
    <p num="0634">After the resist film R2 is removed, the silicon oxide
films 2421, 2422, 2423 and 2424 (the third insulating films)
are removed by, for example, isotropic etching to expose the
sides of the island-like semiconductor layers 2110.</p>
    <p num="0635">Then, the periphery of each island-like
semiconductor layer 2110 is oxidized to form, for example, a
thermally oxidized film 2450 of about 10 to 100 nm thick as a
ninth insulating film (Figs. 559 and 580).</p>
    <p num="0636">Next, the thermally oxidized film (the ninth
insulating film) 2450 is etched away from the periphery of
each island-like semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by
isotropic etching. Then, as required, channel ion
implantation is carried out into the sidewall of the island
semiconductor layer 2110 by slant ion implantation. For 
example, the ion implantation may be performed at an
implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at a boron dose of about
1 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of 5 to 45° with
respect to the normal line of the surface of the substrate.
Preferably the channel ion implantation is performed from
various directions to the island-like semiconductor layers
2110 because a surface impurity concentration becomes more
uniform. Alternatively, instead of the channel ion
implantation, an oxide film containing boron may be
deposited by CVD with a view to utilizing diffusion of boron
from the oxide film. The impurity implantation from the
surface of the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 may be
carried out before the island-like semiconductor layers 2110
are covered with the thermally oxidized film 2450, or during
the formation of the island-like semiconductor layers 2110.
Alternatively, the impurities may be introduced to the silicon
oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423 and 2424 in advance with a
view to implanting the impurities in the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 by thermal treatment or the like
before removing the silicon oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423 and
2424. Means for the implantation are not particularly
limited so long as an impurity concentration distribution is
almost equal over the island-like semiconductor layers 2110.</p>
    <p num="0637">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2460, for example,
is formed as a tenth insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film
to a thickness of about 10 nm around each island-like
semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by thermal
oxidization (Fig. 560 and Fig. 581). The tunnel oxide film,
however, may be formed of not only a thermally oxidized film 
but also a CVD oxide film or a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0638">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 2510, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50
to 200 nm (Figs. 561 and 582).</p>
    <p num="0639">Using the silicon nitride films 2314, 2313 and 2312
(the second insulating films) as a mask, the polysilicon film
2510 is divided into polysilicon films 2511, 2512, 2513 and
2514, for example, by anisotropic etching (Figs. 562 and 583).</p>
    <p num="0640">Then, the silicon nitride films 2312, 2313 and 2314
(the second insulating films) and the silicon nitride film 2321
(the fourth insulating film) are selectively removed and
impurity introduction is carried out to the island-like
semiconductor layer 2110 and the semiconductor substrate
2100 in self-alignment with the polysilicon films 2511, 2512,
2513 and 2514. For example, N-type impurity diffusion
layers 2710 to 2724 are formed at an arsenic concentration of
about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, for example, by solid or vapor
phase diffusion process. At this time, the impurity diffusion
layer 2710 to be a first wiring layer may be adjusted about its
impurity concentration by ion implantation (Figs. 563 and
584). For example, the ion implantation may be carried out
at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at a phosphorus
dose of about 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>15</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> and at an angle of
about 0 to 7° with respect to the normal line of the surface of
the substrate.</p>
    <p num="0641">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2470, for example,
is deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of
about 50 to 500 nm. The silicon oxide film 2470 is buried in
the third trench 2230 by anisotropic etching such that the 
polysilicon film 2511 (the first conductive film) is buried (Figs.
564 and 585). At this time, the silicon oxide film 2470 is
buried in a gap between the polysilicon films 2511 and 2512,
a gap between the polysilicon films 2512 and 2513 and a gap
between the polysilicon films 2513 and 2514.</p>
    <p num="0642">Then, a silicon nitride film 2350, for example, is
deposited to a thickness of 5 to 50 nm as a twelfth insulating
film on the surfaces of the polysilicon films 2512 to 2514 (the
first conductive films) and the silicon oxide film 2470 (the
eleventh insulating film) which are located on the inner wall
of the third trench 2230. The silicon nitride film 2350 is
anisotropically etched back into the form of a sidewall spacer
(Figs. 565 and 586).</p>
    <p num="0643">Then, the silicon oxide film 2470 is etched back, for
example, by isotropic etching to such a degree that the side of
the polysilicon film 2511 (the first conductive film) is exposed.
Then, a polysilicon film 2521, for example, is deposited to a
thickness of 15 to 150 nm as a second conductive film.</p>
    <p num="0644">The polysilicon film 2521 is etched back, for example,
by anisotropic etching. Subsequently, the silicon oxide film
2470 (the eleventh insulating film) and the P-type silicon
substrate 2100 are sequentially etched to form a second
trench 2200 in the P-type silicon substrate 2100 in
self-alignment with the polysilicon film 2521 (the second
conductive film), thereby separating the impurity diffusion
layer 2710. That is, a separation portion of the first wiring
layer is formed in self-alignment with a separation portion of
the second conductive film.</p>
    <p num="0645">Subsequently, the polysilicon film 2521 is etched 
back to such a degree that the polysilicon film 2521 is able to
contact the polysilicon film 2511 to form a selection gate (Figs.
566 and 587). At this time, by setting the intervals between
the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 in a direction of
A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined value or smaller, the
polysilicon film 2521 is formed into a second wiring layer to
be a selection gate line continuous in the direction A-A'
without need to use a masking process.</p>
    <p num="0646">Then, a silicon oxide film 2471, for example, is
deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of
about 50 to 500 nm. The silicon oxide film 2471 is buried in
the third trench 2230 by anisotropic or isotropic etching such
that the polysilicon film 2521 is embedded. At this time, the
depth of the buried silicon oxide film 2471 is so controlled
that the polysilicon film 2512 (the second conductive film)
can be exposed later.</p>
    <p num="0647">Subsequently, the sidewall spacer made of the silicon
nitride film 2350 is removed by isotropic etching and an
interlayer insulating film 2612 is formed on exposed surfaces
of the polysilicon films 2512 to 2514 (the first conductive
films). This interlayer insulating film 2612 may be formed of
an ONO film, for example. The ONO film may be formed in
the same manner as in Production example 1.</p>
    <p num="0648">Then, in the same manner, a polysilicon film (a
second conductive film) 2522 is deposited to a thickness of 15
to 150 nm and etched back so that the polysilicon film 2522
is disposed on the side of the polysilicon film (the first
conductive film) 2512 with intervention of the interlayer
insulating film 2612. At this time, by setting the intervals 
between the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 in the
direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined value or smaller,
the polysilicon film 2522 is formed into a third wiring layer to
be a control gate line continuous in the direction of A-A'
without need to use a masking process (Figs. 567 and 588).</p>
    <p num="0649">By repeating likewise, a polysilicon film (a second
conductive film) 2523 is disposed on the side of the
polysilicon film (the first conductive film) 2513 with
intervention of an interlayer insulating film 2613 (Figs. 568
and 589).</p>
    <p num="0650">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 2472, for example, is
deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of
about 50 to 500 nm. The silicon oxide film 2472 is buried in
the third trench 2230 by anisotropic and isotropic etching
such that the polysilicon film (the second conductive film)
2522 is buried. At this time, the depth of the buried silicon
oxide film 2472 is so controlled that the polysilicon film 2522
can be exposed later. With regard to the polysilicon film
2514 which is the topmost first conductive film, a polysilicon
film (a second conductive film) 2524 is etched back to such a
degree that the polysilicon film 2524 is able to contact the
polysilicon film (the first conductive film) 2514, in the same
manner as the polysilicon film 2511 which is the bottommost
first conductive film.</p>
    <p num="0651">Then, the silicon nitride film 2330 (the fifth
insulating film) and the silicon nitride film 2340 (the sixth
insulating film) are removed, for example, by isotropic etching
to expose the polysilicon film 2540. Then, a silicon oxide
film 2475 is deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a 
thickness of 100 to 500 nm on the top of the polysilicon film
2524. The top portion of the polysilicon film 2540 is exposed
by etch-back or by CMP. A fourth wiring layer 2840 is
formed so that its direction crosses the direction of the
second or third wiring layer and is connected to the top
portion of the island-like semiconductor layer 2110.</p>
    <p num="0652">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed. Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized
which has a memory function according to the state of a
charge in the charge storage layer which is the floating gate
made of the polysilicon film (the first conductive film).</p>
    <p num="0653">In this example, films formed on the surface of the
semiconductor substrate or the polysilicon film such as the
silicon nitride film (the fourth insulating film) 2321, the
silicon nitride film (the fifth insulating film) 2330 and the
silicon nitride film (the twelfth insulating film) 2350 may be
formed of a layered film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon
nitride film from the silicon surface.</p>
    <p num="0654">With regard to the polysilicon films 2510 or 2511 to
2514 (the first conductive films), the polysilicon films 2520 or
2521 to 2524 (the second conductive films) and the
polysilicon film 2540 (the fourth conductive film), impurity
introduction may be carried out during or after the formation
of the polysilicon films or after the separation of the
polysilicon films. The timing of the impurity introduction to
the polysilicon films is not particularly limited so long as
these films become conductive films.</p>
    <p num="0655">In this example, the control gates of the memory cells

the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 are smaller.</p>
    <p num="0665">Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 2493 is etched
back to a depth corresponding to the deposit thickness. The
silicon nitride film 2390 remaining in the third trench 2230
as shown in Fig. 599 is removed by isotropic etching and the
polysilicon film 2550 is etched back by anisotropic etching.
At this time, as shown in Fig. 610, the top of the polysilicon
film 2550 is exposed and removed only in the direction in
which the intervals between the island-like semiconductor
layers 2110 are larger. However, the bottom of the
polysilicon film 2550 is not removed since the third trench
2230 is buried with the silicon oxide film 2493.</p>
    <p num="0666">Then, using as a mask the polysilicon film 2550

an EEPROM memory cell array.</p>
    <p num="0716">First, on a surface of a P-type silicon substrate 2100,
a silicon oxide film 2411 containing arsenic impurities of
about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>22</sup> /cm<sup>3</sup>, for example, is deposited as a
first insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm by CVD.
At this time, ion implantation may be carried out to introduce
the impurities to the insulating film deposited by CVD. For
example, to the silicon oxide film 2411 deposited to a
thickness of 50 to 500 nm, ion implantation may be carried
out at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at an arsenic
dose of about 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of about 0
to 45° with respect to the normal line of the surface of the
substrate. The impurity introduction to the silicon oxide
film 2411 by ion implantation may not necessarily be carried
out immediately after the deposition of the silicon oxide film
2411. Regarding the ion implantation to the silicon oxide
film 2411, the angle for the implantation is not particularly
limited as long as a desired impurity concentration is
obtained. Means for the impurity introduction to the silicon
oxide film 2411 is not limited to the ion implantation, but any
means such as solid or vapor phase diffusion may be used.
Thereafter, a silicon nitride film 2321, for example, is
deposited as a fourth insulating film to a thickness of 10 to
100 nm. If the above-mentioned impurity introduction to the
silicon oxide film 2411 is carried out by ion implantation, the
impurities may be introduced by ion implantation through the
silicon nitride film 2321 into the silicon oxide film 2411.</p>
    <p num="0717">Then, a silicon oxide film 2421, for example, is 
deposited as a third insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm, a silicon nitride film 2312, for example, is deposited
as a second insulating film to a thickness of 10 to 100 nm
and a silicon oxide film 2412 is deposited as a first insulating
film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm.</p>
    <p num="0718">After the films are thus formed in sequence, a silicon
oxide film 2415, for example, is deposited as a first insulating
film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm, a silicon nitride film
2325 is deposited as a fourth insulating film to a thickness of
10 to 100 nm, and then a silicon oxide film 2480 is deposited
as a fourteenth insulating film to a thickness of 100 to 1,000
nm as shown in Figs. 683 and 691.</p>
    <p num="0719">Subsequently, using a resist film R1 patterned by a
known photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 683 and
691), reactive ion etching, for example, is performed to
successively etch the silicon oxide film 2480, the silicon
nitride film 2325, the silicon oxide film 2415, the silicon
nitride film 2315, the silicon oxide film 2424, the silicon

nitride film 2312, the silicon oxide film 2421, the silicon
nitride film 2321 and the silicon oxide film 2411, thereby
forming a fourth trench 2240 (Figs. 684 and 692).</p>
    <p num="0720">The resist film R1 is removed and then island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 are filled in the fourth trench
2240. For example, the island-like semiconductor layers
2110 are formed by selective epitaxial growth from the P-type
silicon substrate 2100 located at the bottom of the fourth
trench 2240. Thereby, a sixth trench 2260 is formed (Figs. 
685 and 693). At this time, the island-like semiconductor
layer 2110 may be grown to a level higher than the silicon
nitride film 2325 such that at least the side of the silicon
oxide film 2415 is covered. Alternatively, the semiconductor
layer 2110 formed by selective epitaxial growth may be etched
back isotropically or anisotropically to a level lower than the
bottom of the silicon nitride film 2315. Or alternatively, the
island-like semiconductor layer 2110 may be formed by a
combination of flattening by CMP and etch-back.</p>
    <p num="0721">Thereafter, a polysilicon film 2540, for example, is
deposited as a fourth conductive film to a thickness of about
100 to 300 nm and then etched back to remain at the bottom
of the sixth trench 2260. Further, a silicon nitride film 2330
is deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of about
200 to 2,000 nm in the sixth trench 2260 and then flattened
by isotropic or anisotropic etch-back or by CMP to be buried
in the sixth trench. At this time, at least the silicon oxide
film 2480 (the fourteenth insulating film) is exposed (Figs.
686 and 694).</p>
    <p num="0722">Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 2480 is
selectively removed, for example, by isotropic etching. A
silicon nitride film 2370 is deposited to a thickness of about
20 to 200 nm as a fifteenth insulating film and anisotropically
etched into the form of a sidewall spacer on the sidewall of
the silicon nitride film 2330 (Figs. 687 and 695). Using the
silicon nitride film 2330 (the fifth insulating film) and the
silicon nitride film 2370 (the fifteenth insulating film) as a
mask, the silicon nitride film 2325 and the silicon oxide film
2415 are etched sequentially by reactive ion etching, thereby 
exposing the silicon nitride film 2315 (Figs. 688 and 696).
At this time, the silicon nitride film 2315 may be etched until
the silicon oxide film 2424 is exposed.</p>
    <p num="0723">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 2340 is deposited
as a sixth insulating film to a thickness of about 5 to 50 nm.
The silicon nitride film 2340 is etched, for example, by
anisotropic etching to remain in the form of a sidewall spacer
on the sidewalls of the silicon nitride film 2330, the
polysilicon film 2540, the silicon nitride film 2325 and the
silicon oxide film 2415 (Figs. 689 and 697). At this time, the
silicon oxide film 2415 containing the impurities (the first
insulating film) is isolated from other films than the
island-like semiconductor layer 2110 by the silicon nitride
film 2325 (the fourth insulating film), the silicon nitride film
2315 (the second insulating film) and the silicon nitride film
2340 (the sixth insulating film) (Figs. 689 and 697).</p>
    <p num="0724">Production steps thereafter follow Production example

polysilicon film 2540 (the fourth conductive film), impurity
introduction may be carried out during or after the formation
of the polysilicon films or after the separation of the
polysilicon films. The timing of the impurity introduction to
the polysilicon films is not particularly limited so long as
these films become conductive films.</p>
    <p num="0728">In this example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a

    <p num="0730">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this
example, regions for forming charge storage layers are defined
in advance by a laminated film comprising plural films, and
then island-like semiconductor layers are formed in a pillar
form by selective epitaxial silicon growth in trenches. 
Tunnel oxide films and floating gates as charge storage layers
are formed on the sides of the island-like semiconductor
layers in the regions for forming the charge storage layers.
The island-like semiconductor layers are each in an
electrically floating state with respect to the semiconductor
substrate. The active regions of the memory cells are
electrically common. In this production example, selection
gate transistors are disposed at the top and the bottom of the
island-like semiconductor layer. A plurality of memory
transistors, for example, two memory transistors, are placed
between the selection gate transistors. The tunnel oxide film
and the floating gate of the transistors are formed at the same
time. The transistors are connected in series along the
island-like semiconductor layer. Further, the thickness of
gate insulating films of the selection gate transistors is equal
to the thickness of gate insulating films of the memory
transistors.</p>
    <p num="0731">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by
the following production process. Figs. 699 to 737 and Figs.
738 to 776 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line
B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1 which is a plan view illustrating
an EEPROM memory cell array.</p>
    <p num="0732">First, on a surface of a P-type silicon substrate 2100,
a silicon oxide film 2411 containing arsenic impurities of
about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>22</sup> /cm<sup>3</sup>, for example, is deposited as a
first insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm by CVD.
At this time, ion implantation may be carried out to introduce
the impurities to the insulating film deposited by CVD. For
example, to the silicon oxide film 2411 deposited to a 
thickness of 50 to 500 nm, ion implantation may be carried
out at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at an arsenic
dose of about 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of about 0
to 45° with respect to the normal line of the surface of the
substrate. The impurity introduction to the silicon oxide
film 2411 by ion implantation may not necessarily be carried
out immediately after the deposition of the silicon oxide film
2411. Regarding the ion implantation to the silicon oxide
film 2411, the angle for the implantation is not particularly
limited as long as a desired impurity concentration is
obtained. Means for the impurity introduction to the silicon
oxide film 2411 is not limited to the ion implantation, but any
means such as solid or vapor phase diffusion may be used.</p>
    <p num="0733">Thereafter, a silicon nitride film 2321, for example, is
deposited as a fourth insulating film to a thickness of 10 to
100 nm. If the above-mentioned impurity introduction to the
silicon oxide film 2411 is carried out by ion implantation, the
impurities may be introduced by ion implantation through the
silicon nitride film 2321 into the silicon oxide film 2411.</p>
    <p num="0734">Then, a silicon oxide film 2421, for example, is
deposited as a third insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm, a silicon nitride film 2312, for example, is deposited
as a second insulating film to a thickness of 10 to 100 nm
and a silicon oxide film 2412 is deposited as a first insulating
film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm.</p>
    <p num="0735">After the films are thus formed in sequence, a silicon
oxide film 2415, for example, is deposited as a first insulating
film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm and a silicon nitride film
2325 is deposited as a fourth insulating film to a thickness of 
100 to 1,000 nm as shown in Figs. 699 and 738.
Subsequently, using a resist film R1 patterned by a known
photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 700 and 739),
reactive ion etching, for example, is performed to successively
etch the silicon nitride film 2325, the silicon oxide film 2415,
the silicon nitride film 2315, the silicon oxide film 2424, the
silicon nitride film 2314, the silicon oxide film 2423, the
silicon nitride film 2313, the silicon oxide film 2422, the
silicon nitride film 2312, the silicon oxide film 2421, the
silicon nitride film 2321 and the silicon oxide film 2411,
thereby forming a fourth trench 2240 (Figs. 701 and 740).</p>
    <p num="0736">The resist film R1 is removed (Figs. 702 and 741) and
then island-like semiconductor layers 2110 are filled in the
fourth trench 2240. For example, the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 are formed by selective epitaxial
growth from the P-type silicon substrate 2100 located at the
bottom of the fourth trench 2240 (Figs. 703 and 742).</p>
    <p num="0737">The thus formed island-like semiconductor layers
2110 are flattened to be flush with the silicon nitride film
2325 (Figs. 704 and 743). The flattening may be carried out
by isotropic or anisotropic etch-back, CMP, or a combination
of various techniques.</p>
    <p num="0738">The silicon nitride film 2325 is anisotropically etched
back to form a seventh trench 2270 (Figs. 705 and 744).</p>
    <p num="0739">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 2490 is deposited to a
thickness of about 20 to 200 nm as a sixteenth insulating
film in the seventh trench 2270 and etched back
anisotropically to remain in the form of a sidewall spacer on
the sidewalls of the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 
(Figs. 706 and 745).</p>
    <p num="0740">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 2380, for example,
is deposited as a seventeenth insulating film to a thickness of
about 20 to 200 nm in the seventh trench 2270 and buried in
the seventh trench 2270, for example, by anisotropic
etch-back (Figs. 707 and 746).</p>
    <p num="0741">Then, the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 are
etched back anisotropically to form an eighth trench 2280.
At this time, the etch-back may be performed to such a degree
that the silicon nitride film 2325 is partially exposed or not
exposed. The etch-back is not limited as long as the
island-like semiconductor layer 2110 is left on the side of the
silicon oxide film 2415 (Figs. 708 and 747).</p>
    <p num="0742">Thereafter, the silicon oxide film 2490 is selectively
removed by isotropic etching (Figs. 709 and 748) and a
polysilicon film 2540, for example, is deposited as a fourth
conductive film to a thickness of about 100 to 300 nm and
buried in the eighth trench 2280 by CMP (Figs. 710 and 749).</p>
    <p num="0743">Using the polysilicon film 2540 as a mask, the silicon
nitride film 2380, the silicon nitride film 2325 and the silicon
oxide film 2415 are removed by anisotropic etching, thereby
forming a third trench 2230 (Figs. 711 and 750).</p>
    <p num="0744">Then, a silicon nitride film 2340 is deposited as a
sixth insulating film to a thickness of about 5 to 50 nm. The
silicon nitride film 2340 is etched anisotropically to remain in
the form of a sidewall spacer on the sidewalls of the
polysilicon film 2540, the silicon nitride film 2325 and the
silicon oxide film 2415 (Figs. 712 and 751). At this time, the
silicon oxide film 2415 containing the impurities (the first 
insulating film) is isolated from other films than the
island-like semiconductor layer 2110 by the silicon nitride
film 2325 (the fourth insulating film), the silicon nitride film
2315 (the second insulating film) and the silicon nitride film
2340 (the sixth insulating film) (Figs. 713 and 752).</p>
    <p num="0745">Then, using the silicon nitride films 2540 and 2340
as a mask, the silicon nitride film 2315, the silicon oxide film
2424, the silicon nitride film 2314, the silicon oxide film 2423,
the silicon nitride film 2313, the silicon oxide film 2422 and
the silicon nitride film 2312 are successively etched, thereby
exposing the silicon oxide film 2421. Thus, a third trench
2230 is formed (Figs. 713 and 752).</p>
    <p num="0746">Thereafter, the silicon oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423
and 2424 are removed by isotropic etching to expose the sides
of the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 (Figs. 714 and
753).</p>
    <p num="0747">Then, the periphery of each island-like
semiconductor layer 2110 is oxidized to form, for example, a
thermally oxidized film 2450 of about 10 to 100 nm thick as a
ninth insulating film.</p>
    <p num="0748">Next, the thermally oxidized film (the ninth
insulating film) 2450 is etched away from the periphery of
each island-like semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by
isotropic etching. Then, as required, channel ion
implantation is carried out into the sidewall of the island
semiconductor layer 2110 by slant ion implantation. For
example, the ion implantation may be performed at an
implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at a boron dose of about
1 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of 5 to 45° with 
respect to the normal line of the surface of the substrate.
Preferably the channel ion implantation is performed from
various directions to the island-like semiconductor layers
2110 because a surface impurity concentration becomes more
uniform. Alternatively, instead of the channel ion
implantation, an oxide film containing boron may be
deposited by CVD with a view to utilizing diffusion of boron
from the oxide film. The impurity implantation from the
surface of the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 may be
carried out before the island-like semiconductor layers 2110
are covered with the thermally oxidized film 2450, or during
the formation of the island-like semiconductor layers 2110.
Alternatively, the impurities may be introduced to the silicon
oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423 and 2424 in advance with a
view to implanting the impurities in the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 by thermal treatment or the like
before removing the silicon oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423 and
2424. Means for the implantation are not particularly
limited so long as an impurity concentration distribution is
almost equal over the island-like semiconductor layers 2110.</p>
    <p num="0749">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2460, for example,
is formed as a tenth insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film
to a thickness of about 10 nm around each island-like
semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by thermal
oxidization. The tunnel oxide film, however, may be formed
of not only a thermally oxidized film but also a CVD oxide film
or a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0750">Then, a polysilicon film 2510, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50 
to 200 nm (Figs. 715 and 754). Using the polysilicon film
2540 (the fourth conductive film), the silicon nitride film 2340
(the sixth insulating film) and the silicon nitride films 2342,
2343 and 2344 (the second insulating films) as a mask, the
polysilicon film 2510 is divided into polysilicon films 2511,
2512, 2513 and 2514 by anisotropic or isotropic etching (Figs.
716 and 755).</p>
    <p num="0751">Then, a silicon oxide film 2470, for example, is
deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of
about 50 to 500 nm (Figs. 717 and 756).</p>
    <p num="0752">The silicon oxide film 2470 is buried in the third
trench 2230, for example, by anisotropic or isotropic etching
such that the polysilicon film 2511 (the first conductive film)
is embedded (Figs. 718 and 757). At this time, the depth of
the buried silicon oxide film 2470 is so controlled that the
silicon nitride film 2312 (the second insulating film) is
partially exposed.</p>
    <p num="0753">Then, a silicon nitride film 2350, for example, is
deposited as a twelfth insulating film to a thickness of 5 to 50
nm on the surfaces of the polysilicon films 2512 to 2514 (the
first conductive films), the silicon nitride film 2340 (the sixth
insulating film), the silicon nitride films 2342, 2343 and 2344
(the second insulating films) and the silicon oxide film 2470
(the eleventh insulating film) which are present on the inner
wall of the third trench 2230. At this time, by setting the
intervals between the island-like semiconductor layers 2110
in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined value or
smaller, a mask for forming a control gate line continuous in
the direction is formed in self-alignment without need to use 
a masking process. That is, if the deposition thickness of
the silicon nitride film 2350 is about half or more of the width
of the third trench 2230 defined by the silicon nitride film
2340, the silicon nitride film 2350 fills the third trench 2230
only in a direction of A-A' of Fig. 1. The thickness of the
silicon nitride film 2350 is so set that concave portions
defined by the polysilicon films 2511, 2512, 2513 and 2514
(the first conductive films) are not completely filled with the
silicon nitride film 2350 (Figs. 719 and 758).</p>
    <p num="0754">The silicon nitride film 2350 is etched back
anisotropically into the form of a sidewall spacer such that
the silicon oxide film 2470 is exposed as shown in Fig. 759.
At this time, as shown in Fig. 720, the third trench 2230 in a
direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 is filled with the silicon nitride film
2350.</p>
    <p num="0755">Then, the silicon oxide film 2470 is etched back
isotropically to such a degree that the side of the polysilicon
film 2511 (the first conductive film) is exposed (Figs. 721 and
760). Then, a polysilicon film 2521, for example, is
deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness of 15 to
150 nm.</p>
    <p num="0756">The polysilicon film 2521 is etched back, for example,
by anisotropic etching (Figs. 722 and 761). Subsequently, as
shown in Fig. 762, the silicon nitride film 2321 (the fourth
insulating film), the silicon oxide film 2411 (the first
insulating film) and the P-type silicon substrate 2100 are
successively etched to form a second trench 2200 in the
P-type silicon substrate 2100 in self-alignment with the
polysilicon film 2521 (the second conductive film), thereby 
separating the impurity diffusion layer 2710.</p>
    <p num="0757">That is, a separation portion of the first wiring layer
is formed in self-alignment with a separation portion of the
second conductive film (Fig. 723 and Fig. 762). At this time,
by setting the intervals between the island-like semiconductor
layers 2110 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined
value or smaller, the polysilicon film 2521 is formed into a
second wiring layer to be a selection gate line continuous in
the direction without need to use a masking process.</p>
    <p num="0758">Then, the silicon nitride film (the twelfth insulating
film) 2350 is removed by isotropic etching from the surfaces
of the polysilicon films 2512, 2513 and 2514 (Figs. 724 and
763). That is, by isotropically etching the silicon nitride film
2350 to a depth corresponding to the deposit thickness, the
surfaces of the polysilicon films 2512, 2513 and 2514 are
exposed. At this time, as shown in Fig. 724, the third trench
2230 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 is filled with the silicon
nitride film 2350.</p>
    <p num="0759">Then, a silicon oxide film 2471, for example, is
deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of
about 50 to 500 nm and buried in the second and third
trenches 2220 and 2230 by anisotropic or isotropic etching
such that the polysilicon film 2521 is embedded (Figs. 725
and 764). At this time, the depth of the buried silicon oxide
film 2471 is so controlled that the silicon nitride film 2312 is
partially exposed.</p>
    <p num="0760">Subsequently, an interlayer insulating film 2612 is
formed on exposed surfaces of the polysilicon films 2512 to
2514 (Fig. 726 and Fig. 765). This interlayer insulating film 
2612 may be formed of an ONO film, for example. The ONO
film may be formed in the same manner as in Production
example 1.</p>
    <p num="0761">Then, in the same manner, a polysilicon film (a
second conductive film) 2520 is deposited to a thickness of 15
to 150 nm (Figs. 727 and 766).</p>
    <p num="0762">A silicon oxide film 2472 is then deposited as an
eleventh insulating film to a thickness of about 50 to 500 nm
and buried in the third trench 2230 by anisotropic or
isotropic etching such that the polysilicon film 2513 is
embedded with intervention of the polysilicon film 2520 and
the interlayer insulating film 2612 (Figs. 728 and 767).</p>
    <p num="0763">Using the silicon oxide film 2472 as a mask, the
polysilicon film 2520 and the interlayer insulating film 2612
are partially removed by isotropic etching to expose the
polysilicon film 2514 (Figs. 729 to 730 and Figs. 768 to 769).</p>
    <p num="0764">The silicon oxide film 2472 is removed (Figs. 731 and
770), and then the polysilicon films 2522 and 2523 are
divided by anisotropic etching. At this time, since the
polysilicon films 2522 and 2523 are defined in advance to be
separated by the silicon nitride film 2350, the polysilicon
films 2522 and 2523 are simultaneously disposed on the side
of the polysilicon film 2512 with intervention of the interlayer
insulating film 2612 (Figs. 732 and 771).</p>
    <p num="0765">Then, a silicon oxide film 2473 is deposited as an
eleventh insulating film to a thickness of about 50 to 500 nm
(Figs. 733 and 772) and buried in the third trench 2230 by
anisotropic or isotropic etching such that the polysilicon films
2522 and 2523 are buried (Figs. 734 and 773). With regard 
to the polysilicon film 2514 which is the topmost first
conductive film, a polysilicon film (a second conductive film)
2524 is etched back to such a degree that the polysilicon film
2524 is able to contact the polysilicon film (the first
conductive film) 2514 (Figs. 735 and 774).</p>
    <p num="0766">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2474 is deposited
as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of 100 to 500 nm
on the top of the polysilicon film 2524. The top portion of
the polysilicon film 2540 is exposed by etch-back or by CMP.
Then a fourth wiring layer is formed so that its direction
crosses the direction of the second or third wiring layer and is
connected to the top portion of the island-like semiconductor
layer 2110.</p>
    <p num="0767">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed.</p>
    <p num="0768">Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized which
has a memory function according to the state of a charge in
the charge storage layer which is the floating gate made of the
polysilicon film (the first conductive film).</p>
    <p num="0769">In this example, films formed on the surface of the
semiconductor substrate or the polysilicon film such as the
silicon nitride film (the sixth insulating film) 2340 and the
silicon nitride film (the twelfth insulating film) 2350 may be
formed of a layered film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon
nitride film from the silicon surface.</p>
    <p num="0770">With regard to the polysilicon films 2510 or 2511 to
2514 (the first conductive films), the polysilicon films 2520 or
2521 to 2524 (the second conductive films) and the 
polysilicon film 2540 (the fourth conductive film), impurity
introduction may be carried out during or after the formation
of the polysilicon films or after the separation of the
polysilicon films. The timing of the impurity introduction to
the polysilicon films is not particularly limited so long as
these films become conductive films.</p>
    <p num="0771">In the example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a
mask. Further, by providing the selection gates in the top
and the bottom of a set of memory cells, it is possible to
prevent the phenomenon that a memory cell transistor is
over-erased.</p>

    <p num="0772">In an example of production process for producing a

back anisotropically to such a degree that the polysilicon film
2521 is able to contact the polysilicon film 2511 to form a

so controlled that the silicon nitride film 2342 is partially
exposed.</p>
    <p num="0780">Subsequently, an interlayer insulating film 2612 is 
formed on the exposed surfaces of the polysilicon films 2512
to 2514. This interlayer insulating film 2612 may be formed
of an ONO film, for example. The ONO film may be formed in
the same manner as in Production example 1.</p>
    <p num="0781">Subsequently, in the same manner, a polysilicon film

film (a second conductive film) 2523 is disposed on the side of
the polysilicon film (the first conductive film) 2513 with
intervention of an interlayer insulating film 2613. With
regard to the polysilicon film 2514 which is the topmost first

2524 is etched back to such a degree that the polysilicon film
2524 is able to contact the polysilicon film (the first

    <p num="0782">Then, the silicon nitride film 2330 (the fifth
insulating film) and the silicon nitride film 2340 (the sixth
insulating film) are removed, for example, by isotropic etching
to expose the polysilicon film 2540 (Figs. 780 and 787). A
silicon oxide film 2474 is deposited as an eleventh insulating

polysilicon film 2524. Subsequently, using a resist film R3
patterned by a known photolithographic technique as a mask

thereby forming a second trench 2220 in the P-type silicon
substrate 2100 and separating the impurity diffusion layer
2710 (Figs. 782 and 789).</p>
    <p num="0783">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2475 is deposited

The top portion of the polysilicon film 2540 (the fourth
conductive film) is exposed by etch-back or by CMP. A
fourth wiring layer is formed so that its direction crosses the
direction of the second or third wiring layer and is connected
to the top portion of the island-like semiconductor layer
2110.</p>
    <p num="0784">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed. Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized
which has a memory function according to the state of a

of a layered film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon nitride film
from the silicon surface.</p>

2514 (the first conductive films), the polysilicon films 2520 or

polysilicon film 2540 (the fourth conductive film), impurity
introduction may be carried out during or after the formation
of the polysilicon films or after the separation of the
polysilicon films. The timing of the impurity introduction to
the polysilicon films is not particularly limited so long as
these films become conductive films.</p>

    <p num="0805">First, on a surface of a P-type silicon substrate 2100,
a silicon nitride film 2321, for example, is deposited as a
fourth insulating film to a thickness of 10 to 100 nm.</p>
    <p num="0806">A silicon oxide film 2421, for example, is deposited 
as a third insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm, a

2422 is deposited as a third insulating film to a thickness of

    <p num="0807">After the films are thus formed sequentially, a silicon
oxide film 2424 is deposited as a third insulating film to a
thickness of 50 to 500 nm, a silicon nitride film 2315 is
deposited as a second insulating film to a thickness of 20 to
200 nm, and a silicon oxide film 2495 is deposited as a
twenty-third insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm as
shown in Fig. 809 and 827.</p>
    <p num="0808">Using a resist film R1 patterned by a known
photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 809 and 827),
reactive ion etching, for example, is performed to successively
etch the silicon oxide film 2495, the silicon nitride film 2315,
the silicon oxide film 2424, the silicon nitride film 2314, the
silicon oxide film 2423, the silicon nitride film 2313, the
silicon oxide film 2422, the silicon nitride film 2312 and the
silicon oxide film 2421 and the silicon nitride film 2321,
thereby forming a fourth trench 2240 (Figs. 810 and 828).</p>
    <p num="0809">The resist film R1 is removed and then island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 are filled in the fourth trench
2240. For example, the island-like semiconductor layers
2110 are formed by selective epitaxial growth from the P-type
silicon substrate 2100 located at the bottom of the fourth
trench 2240. The thus formed island-like semiconductor
layers 2110 are flattened to be flush with the silicon nitride
film 2315. The flattening may be carried out by isotropic or 
anisotropic etch-back, CMP, or a combination of various
techniques.</p>
    <p num="0810">The island-like semiconductor layers 2110 are
anisotropically etched back almost to a height where the top
of the silicon nitride film 2315 is positioned (Figs. 811 and
829). Further, a polysilicon film 2540 (a fourth conductive
film) and a silicon nitride film 2330 (a fifth insulating film)
are buried (Figs. 812 and 830).</p>
    <p num="0811">Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 2495 is removed,
for example, by isotropic etching. Then, a silicon nitride film
2340, for example, is deposited as a sixth insulating film to a
thickness of about 20 to 200 nm and anisotropically etched
back into the form of a sidewall spacer. At this time, the
silicon nitride film 2315 is etched simultaneously by using
the sidewall spacer as a mask. However, the silicon nitride
film 2315 may not necessarily be etched simultaneously with
the formation of the sidewall spacer.</p>
    <p num="0812">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 2496, for example, is
deposited as a twenty-third insulating film to a thickness of
50 to 500 nm and is etched back to such a degree that the
top surfaces of the silicon nitride films 2330 and 2340 are
exposed (Figs. 813 and 831).</p>
    <p num="0813">Further, the silicon nitride films 2330 and 2340 are
etched back such that at least the top surfaces thereof are
disposed at a level lower than the top of the silicon oxide film
2496. Then, a polysilicon film 2550, for example, is
deposited as a fifth conductive film to a thickness of about 15
to 150 nm. The polysilicon film 2550 is flattened to be flush
with the silicon oxide film 2496 (Figs. 814 and 832). At this 
time, the flattening may be carried out by isotropic or
anisotropic etch-back, CMP or a combination of various
techniques. If the thicknesses of the silicon nitride films
2330 and 2340 are greater than the total thickness of the
silicon nitride films 2314, 2313, 2312 and 2321, the
polysilicon film 2550 may not be used. Further, the
polysilicon film 2550 may not necessarily be a conductive film
but may be formed of a material different from the silicon
oxide film and the silicon nitride film.</p>
    <p num="0814">The silicon oxide film 2496 is removed, for example,
by isotropic etching. Then, using the polysilicon film 2550
as a mask, reactive ion etching, for example, is performed to
successively etch the silicon oxide film 2424, the silicon
nitride film 2314, the silicon oxide film 2423, the silicon
nitride film 2313, the silicon oxide film 2422, the silicon
nitride film 2312, the silicon oxide film 2421 and the silicon
nitride film 2321, thereby exposing the P-type silicon
substrate 2100 (Figs. 815 and 833). At this time, the silicon
nitride film 2321 may remain.</p>
    <p num="0815">Thereafter, the silicon oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423
and 2424 (the third insulating films) are removed, for example,
by isotropic etching to expose the sides of the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110. Then, the surface of each
island-like semiconductor layer 2110 is oxidized to form, for
example, a thermally oxidized film 2450 of about 10 to 100
nm thick as a ninth insulating film (Figs. 816 and 834).</p>
    <p num="0816">Next, the thermally oxidized film (the ninth
insulating film) 2450 is etched away from the periphery of
each island-like semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by 
isotropic etching. Then, as required, channel ion
implantation is carried out into the sidewall of the island
semiconductor layer 2110 by slant ion implantation. For
example, the ion implantation may be performed at an
implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at a boron dose of about
1 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of 5 to 45° with
respect to the normal line of the surface of the substrate.
Preferably the channel ion implantation is performed from
various directions to the island-like semiconductor layers
2110 because a surface impurity concentration becomes more
uniform. Alternatively, instead of the channel ion
implantation, an oxide film containing boron may be
deposited by CVD with a view to utilizing diffusion of boron
from the oxide film. The impurity implantation from the
surface of the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 may be
carried out before the island-like semiconductor layers 2110
are covered with the thermally oxidized film 2450, or during
the formation of the island-like semiconductor layers 2110.
Alternatively, the impurities may be introduced to the silicon
oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423 and 2424 in advance with a
view to implanting the impurities in the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 by thermal treatment or the like
before removing the silicon oxide films 2421, 2422, 2423 and
2424. Means for the implantation are not particularly
limited so long as an impurity concentration distribution is
almost equal over the island-like semiconductor layers 2110.</p>
    <p num="0817">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2460, for example,
is formed as a tenth insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film
to a thickness of about 10 nm around each island-like 
semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by CVD (Fig. 817 and
835). The tunnel oxide film, however, may be formed of not
only a CVD oxide film but also a thermally oxidized film or a
nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0818">Then, a polysilicon film 2510, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50
to 200 nm. Using the silicon nitride films 2314, 2313 and
2312 (the second insulating films) as a mask, the polysilicon
film 2510 is divided into polysilicon films 2511, 2512, 2513
and 2514, for example, by anisotropic etching (Figs. 818 and
836).</p>
    <p num="0819">A silicon oxide film 2497, for example, is then
deposited to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm as a twenty-third
insulating film. The silicon oxide film 2470 is buried by
isotropic etching such that at least the polysilicon film 2511
(the first conductive film) is embedded (Figs. 819 and 837).</p>
    <p num="0820">Subsequently, the polysilicon films 2512, 2513 and
2514 are reduced in a horizontal direction, for example, by
isotropic etching to such a degree that the tunnel oxide film
disposed on the side of the island-like semiconductor layer
2110 is not exposed.</p>
    <p num="0821">Thereafter, an interlayer insulating film 2612 is
formed on exposed surfaces of the polysilicon films 2512 to
2514. This interlayer insulating film 2612 may be formed of
an ONO film, for example. The ONO film may be formed in
the same manner as in Production example 1.</p>
    <p num="0822">The interlayer insulating film 2612 and the silicon
oxide film 2497 are etched back anisotropically by using the
silicon nitride films 2330 and 2340 as a mask, thereby 
exposing the polysilicon film 2511 (the first conductive film)
(Figs. 820 and 838).</p>
    <p num="0823">Then, a polysilicon film 2520, for example, is
deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness of about
15 to 150 nm and then anisotropically etched back.
Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 2470 (the eleventh
insulating film) and the P-type silicon substrate 2100 are
successively etched to form a second trench 2200 in the
P-type silicon substrate 2100 in self-alignment with the
polysilicon film 2520 (the second conductive film) (Figs. 821
and 839).</p>
    <p num="0824">A silicon oxide film 2470, for example, is buried as
an eleventh insulating film in the second trench 2220. Using
the silicon nitride films 2330 and 2340 as a mask, the
polysilicon film 2520 is etched back to such a degree that the
polysilicon film 2520 is able to contact the polysilicon film
2511 to form a selection gate and is divided into polysilicon
films 2522, 2523 ad 2524. At this time, by setting the
intervals between the island-like semiconductor layers 2110
in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined value or
smaller, the polysilicon film 2520 is formed into a second
wiring layer to be a selection gate line continuous in the
direction without need to use a masking process.</p>
    <p num="0825">Then, the silicon oxide film 2497 is removed by
isotropic etching, for example, and the silicon nitride films
2312 to 2315 (the second insulating films) and the silicon
nitride film 2321 (the fourth insulating film) are selectively
removed.</p>
    <p num="0826">Subsequently, impurities are introduced into the 
island-like semiconductor layer 2110 and the semiconductor
substrate 2100 in self-alignment with the separated
polysilicon films 2521, 2522, 2523 and 2524. For example,
impurity introduction may be carried out at an arsenic dose
of about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>21</sup> /cm<sup>3</sup> by solid or vapor phase
diffusion to form N-type impurity diffusion layers 2710 to
2714. At this time, the impurity diffusion layer 2710 to be a
first wiring layer may be adjusted about its impurity
concentration by ion implantation (Figs. 822 and 840). For
example, the ion implantation may be carried out at an
implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at a phosphorus dose of
about 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>15</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> and at an angle of about 0 to
7° with respect to the normal line of the surface of the
substrate.</p>
    <p num="0827">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 2470, for example, is
then deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of
about 50 to 500 nm. The silicon oxide film 2470 is buried in
the third trench 2230, for example, by anisotropic or isotropic
etching such that the polysilicon film 2511 (the first
conductive film) and the polysilicon film 2521 (the second
conductive film) are embedded and the polysilicon films 2512
to 1514 are embedded on the side of the island-like
semiconductor layer 2110. Further, a polysilicon film 2560,
for example, is deposited to a thickness of 15 to 150 nm as a
sixth conductive film (Figs. 823 and 841). At this time, by
setting the thicknesses of the silicon nitride films 2313 and
2314 to a predetermined value or greater in advance, spaces
are obtained as shown in Fig. 823.</p>
    <p num="0828">Then, the polysilicon film 2560 is etched back by 
isotropic etching to a depth corresponding to the deposit
thickness to form a control gate line. At this time, by setting
the intervals between the island-like semiconductor layers
2110 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined value
or smaller, the polysilicon film 2560 is formed into a third
wiring layer to be a control gate line continuous in the
direction without need to use a masking process.</p>
    <p num="0829">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2472, for example,
is buried as an eleventh insulating film to such a degree that
the polysilicon film 2564 is embedded. Then, a silicon
nitride film 2342, for example, is deposited to a thickness of
about 20 to 200 nm as a sixth insulating film and
anisotropically etched into the form of a sidewall spacer.</p>
    <p num="0830">Thereafter, the silicon oxide film 2472 is buried to
such a degree that the polysilicon film 2563 is embedded
(Figs. 824 and 842).</p>
    <p num="0831">The polysilicon film 2564, the polysilicon film 2524
and the interlayer insulating film 2612 are removed from the
side of the polysilicon film 2514. Then, a polysilicon film
2574, for example, is deposited to a thickness of about 15 to
150 nm as a seventh conductive film and etched back to such
a degree that the polysilicon film 2574 is able to contact the
polysilicon film 2514 (Figs. 825 and 843).</p>
    <p num="0832">Then, the silicon nitride films 2330 and 2340 are
etched back by anisotropic etching to such a degree that the
polysilicon film 2540 is exposed. A silicon oxide film 2475 is
deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of 100
to 500 nm on the top of the polysilicon film 2574. The top
portion of the polysilicon film 2540 is exposed by etch-back or 
by CMP and a fourth wiring layer is formed so that its
direction crosses the direction of the second or third wiring
layer and is connected to the top portion of the island-like
semiconductor layer 2110.</p>
    <p num="0833">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed. Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized
which has a memory function according to the state of a
charge in the charge storage layer which is the floating gate
made of the polysilicon film (the first conductive film) (Figs.
826 and 844).</p>
    <p num="0834">In this example, films formed on the surface of the
semiconductor substrate or the polysilicon film such as the
silicon nitride film (the fourth insulating film) 2321, the
silicon nitride film (the fifth insulating film) 2330 and the
silicon nitride film (the twelfth insulating film) 2350 may be
formed of a layered film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon
nitride film from the silicon surface.</p>
    <p num="0835">With regard to the polysilicon films 2510 or 2511 to
2514 (the first conductive films), the polysilicon films 2520 or

films 2560 or 2562 and 2563 (the sixth conductive films), the
polysilicon film 2574 (the seventh conductive film) and the
polysilicon film 2540 (the fourth conductive film), impurity
introduction may be carried out during or after the formation
of the polysilicon films or after the separation of the
polysilicon films. The timing of the impurity introduction to
the polysilicon films is not particularly limited so long as
these films become conductive films. </p>
    <p num="0836">In this example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a
mask. That is possible only where the island-like
semiconductor layers are not disposed symmetrically to a
diagonal. In contrast, if the island-like semiconductor layers
are disposed symmetrically to a diagonal, for example, the
wiring layers may be separated through patterning with use of
resist films by photolithography.</p>
    <p num="0837">Further, by providing the selection gates in the top

    <heading>Production example 40</heading>
    <p num="0838">In contrast to Production example 11, explanation is
given of an example of production process in which the silicon
nitride film 2340 which is a sixth insulating film to be a
sidewall mask is not formed and the third trench 2230 is
formed by patterning with use of resist films by
photolithography.</p>
    <p num="0839">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by
the following production process. Figs. 845 to 873 and Figs.
874 to 902 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line
B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1 which is a plan view illustrating

    <p num="0840">The production steps are the same as those of

known photolithographic technique is disposed on the silicon
nitride film (the fifth insulating film) 2330 (Figs. 845 to 848
and Figs. 874 to 877). </p>
    <p num="0841">Thereafter, using the resist film R2 as a mask (Figs.
849 and 878), reactive ion etching, for example, is performed
to successively etch the silicon nitride film 2330, the

exposing the silicon oxide film 2421 (the third insulating film).

2312 (the second insulating film) and the silicon nitride film
2322 (the fourth insulating film). For example, the silicon
nitride film 2342 deposited to a thickness of about 5 to 50 nm
is removed from the bottom of the third trench 2230 by
anisotropic etching, thereby exposing the silicon oxide film
2421 (Figs. 851 and 880).</p>
    <p num="0843">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 2432, for example, is

in the third trench 2230, for example, by anisotropic etching
such that the silicon oxide film 2443 is disposed on the side
of the silicon oxide film 2422 (Figs. 854 and 883). At this
time, the depth of the buried silicon oxide film 2443 (the
eighth insulating film) is so controlled that the side of the
silicon oxide film (the first insulating film) 2413 containing
the impurities is exposed.</p>
    <p num="0845">Then, in the same manner as the above, a silicon

    <p num="0854">The silicon nitride film 2345 may be arranged to
cover only the exposed portion of the silicon oxide film 2415

sacrificial oxidation and the formation of the tunnel oxide film
and the oxidized portion is eroded through isotropic etching
of the silicon oxide film. However, the eroded portion is
filled through the deposition of the polysilicon film 2510 (the

    <p num="0856">According to this example, the same effect as

Further, since a step of forming the sidewall spacer made of
the silicon nitride film is omitted from the production steps of
Production example 11, the structure of the semiconductor
memory is simplified as compared with that of Production
example 11. Therefore, the semiconductor memory of this
example is advantageous in easy formation, i.e., improvement
in device reliability.</p>
    <heading>Production example 41</heading>
    <p num="0857">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this
example, regions for forming charge storage layers are defined
in advance by a laminated film comprising plural films, and
then island-like semiconductor layers in a pillar form are
formed by selective epitaxial silicon growth in trenches
opened by using a photoresist mask. Laminated insulating
films as charge storage layers are formed on the sides of the
island-like semiconductor layers in the regions for forming
the charge storage layers. The island-like semiconductor
layers are each in an electrically floating state with respect to
the semiconductor substrate. The active regions of the
memory cells are electrically common. In this production
example, selection gate transistors are disposed at the top
and the bottom of the island-like semiconductor layer. A
plurality of memory transistors, for example, two memory
transistors, are placed between the selection gate transistors.
The laminated insulating films of the transistors are formed
at the same time. The transistors are connected in series 
along the island-like semiconductor layer. Further, the
thickness of gate insulating films of the selection gate
transistors is equal to the thickness of gate insulating films of
the memory transistors.</p>
    <p num="0858">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by
the following production process. Figs. 903 to 907 and Figs.

polysilicon films 2511 to 2514 are formed as the first
conductive films (Figs. 903 and 908). At this time, the
silicon nitride films 2313, 2314 (second insulating films),
2322 and 2323 (fourth insulating films) are formed to have
such a thickness that they do not completely cover the
impurity diffusion layers 2721, 2722, 2723 and 2724 which
are N-type semiconductor layers located adjacent to the
silicon nitride films, respectively.</p>
    <p num="0860">Then, the polysilicon films 2511 to 2514 are
isotropically etched back (Figs. 904 and 909).</p>
    <p num="0861">The silicon nitride films 2312 to 2315 (the second

that the island-like semiconductor layer is not exposed (Figs.
905 and 910).</p>
    <p num="0862">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 2550, for example, is
deposited as a fifth conductive film to a thickness of about 50

films) 2412 to 2414 containing impurities as a mask, the
polysilicon film 2550 is divided into polysilicon films 2551,
2552, 2553 and 2554 (the fifth conductive films), for example,
by anisotropic etching (Figs. 906 and 911).</p>
    <p num="0863">Then, a silicon oxide film 2470 is deposited as an
eleventh insulating film. Production steps thereafter follow
Production example 11 (Figs. 323 to 335 and Figs. 356 to

has a memory function according to the state of a charge in
the charge storage layer which is the floating gate made of the
polysilicon film (the first conductive film) (Figs. 907 and 912).</p>
    <p num="0864">In this example, the silicon nitride films 2312 and

2313 and 2314 (the second conductive films) and the silicon
nitride films 2322 and 2323 (the fourth insulating films).
However, they may have a thickness smaller than that of the

(the twelfth insulating film) 2350 may be formed of a layered
film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon nitride film from the
silicon surface.</p>
    <p num="0866">With regard to the polysilicon films 2510 or 2512 to 
2514 (the first conductive films), the polysilicon films 2520 or

polysilicon film 2540 (the fourth conductive film), impurity
introduction may be carried out during or after the formation
of the polysilicon films or after the separation of the
polysilicon films. The timing of the impurity introduction to
the polysilicon films is not particularly limited so long as
these films become conductive films.</p>
    <p num="0867">In this example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a
mask. That is possible only where the island-like
semiconductor layers are not disposed symmetrically to a
diagonal. In contrast, if the island-like semiconductor layers
are disposed symmetrically to a diagonal, for example, the
wiring layers may be separated through patterning with use of
resist films by photolithography.</p>
    <p num="0868">Further, by providing the selection gates in the top

prevent the phenomenon that a memory cell transistor is

    <p num="0869">In an example of production process for producing a
semiconductor memory in which in which the selection gates
and the floating gates of the transistors are formed at the

process in which terminals are formed which electrically
connect the first, the second and the third wiring layers to a
peripheral circuit, respectively.</p>
    <p num="0870">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by 
the following production process. Figs. 913 and 919 are
sectional views taken on line H-H' of Fig. 1 illustrating a
memory cell array of EEPROM, Figs. 914 to 918 are sectional
views taken on lines shifted parallel to line I-I' of Fig. 10 in a
direction of H-H', respectively, and Figs. 920 to 924 are
sectional views taken on lines shifted parallel to line I-I' of Fig.
11 in a direction of H-H', respectively. These sectional views
are taken at locations showing sites (contact portions) 2921,
2932, 2933, 2934 and 2910 where terminals mounted on the
top face of the semiconductor device are electrically
connected to the buried wiring layers 2521, 2522, 2523, 2524
and 2710 for the application of voltage to the buried wiring
layers from outside.</p>
    <p num="0871">Production steps until the silicon oxide film (the
tenth insulating film) 2474 is deposited to a thickness of 100
to 500 nm are the same as those in Production Example 11.</p>
    <p num="0872">Thereafter, the surface of the silicon nitride film
2474 is flattened by etch-back or CMP as required. Using a
resist film patterned by a known photolithographic technique
as a mask, the silicon nitride film 2474 is etched by reactive
ion etching to reach a wiring layer intended to be lead out.
This step is repeated as many times as the number of wiring
layers to be lead out.</p>
    <p num="0873">More particularly, for leading out the first wiring
layer, using a resist film patterned by a known
photolithographic technique as a mask, reactive ion etching is
performed from the top surface of the silicon oxide film (the
tenth insulating film) 2474 to reach the impurity diffusion
layer 2710 only in a region where the lead-out portion of the 
wiring layer exists.</p>
    <p num="0874">Subsequently, for leading out a wiring layer which is
the second from the bottom, for example, using a resist film
patterned by a known photolithographic technique as a mask,
reactive ion etching is performed from the top surface of the
silicon oxide film 2474 to reach the polysilicon film (the
second conductive film) 2521 in a region of the lead-out
portion of the wiring layer other than the region where the
etching has been performed previously.</p>
    <p num="0875">The order of etching for leading out the wiring layers
is not particularly limited. For example, two trenches may
be simultaneously formed to reach a wiring layer in the
lead-out portion of the wiring layers. One of the trenches
may be masked by a resist film and the other may be further
etched to reach a lower wiring layer. Means for forming
trenches for leading out the wiring layers are not particularly
limited so long as the trenches are separately formed in the
lead-out portion of the wiring layers to reach the wiring layers
in a number equal to the number of the wiring layers to be
lead out. The positions of the sites (contact portions) 2921,
2932, 2933, 2924 and 2910 are not particularly limited so
long as the terminals disposed on the top face of the
semiconductor device are electrically connected to the buried
wiring layers 2521, 2522, 2523, 2524 and 2710.</p>
    <p num="0876">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 2499, for example, is
deposited as a twenty-sixth insulating film to a thickness of
10 to 100 nm and is etched back by about a thickness
deposited so that a sidewall spacer made of the silicon oxide
film 2499 is formed on an inner wall of the trenches formed in 
the lead-out portion of the wiring layers.</p>
    <p num="0877">The twenty-sixth insulating film is not particularly
limited to a silicon oxide film but may be formed of a silicon
nitride film or any other insulating film.</p>
    <p num="0878">Production steps thereafter follow Production
Example 11. When the fourth wiring layer is formed, a metal
or a conductive film is buried in the trenches formed in the
lead-out portion of the wiring layers with intervention of the
sidewall spacer made of the silicon oxide film 2499. Thereby
the first, second, third wiring layers are lead out to the top
face of the semiconductor (Fig. 913 to Fig. 918).</p>
    <p num="0879">Alternatively, the second and third wiring layers may
be arranged in the lead-out portion of the wiring layers as
shown in Figs. 919 to 924, and the trench formed in the
lead-out portion may have some distance from other wiring
layers unintended to be lead out with intervention of an
insulating film. In this case, by omitting the formation of
the sidewall spacer of the silicon oxide film 2499, reduction in
resistance at the contact portions is expected. As a further
effect, parasitic capacity between the wiring layers is expected
to decrease because unrelated wiring layers do not exist
around the trench.</p>
    <p num="0880">The lead-out of the first, second and third wiring
layers to the top face of the semiconductor by the
above-described process is applicable to all examples of the
present invention.</p>
    <heading>Production example 43</heading>
    <p num="0881">Explanation is given of an example of production

2100 or the island-like semiconductor layers 2110.</p>
    <p num="0882">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by
the following production process. Figs. 925 and 926 are
sectional views taken on line A-A' and line B-B', respectively,
in Fig. 1 illustrating a memory cell array of an EEPROM.</p>
    <p num="0883">In Figs. 925 and 926, the island-like semiconductor
layer 2110 and the semiconductor substrate 2100 are
structurally connected. In this example, the island-like

2100 are electrically insulated by a depletion layer formed on
an island-like semiconductor layer 2110 side or a
semiconductor substrate 2100 side of a PN junction between
the impurity diffusion layer 2710 as the first wiring layer and
the island-like semiconductor layer 2110 or the
semiconductor substrate 2100 owing to a potential difference
between a potential given to the impurity diffusion layer 2710
and a potential given to the island-like semiconductor layer
2110 or the semiconductor substrate 2100 at reading or at
erasing.</p>
    <p num="0884">More particularly, supposing that the depletion layer
formed on the island-like semiconductor layer 2110 side or
the semiconductor substrate 2100 side has a width W, the
electrical insulation can be produced if at least either a space
Sa1 or Sb1 of the impurity diffusion layer 2710 shown in Fig.
925 and Fig. 926 is two or less times as large as W. Also, as 
regards the N-type impurity diffusion layers 2721 to 2723,
like the impurity diffusion layer 2710, the active region of
each transistor is electrically insulated if at least either one of
Sa2 and Sb2, Sa3 and Sb3, or Sa4 and Sb4 is two or less
times as-large as W.</p>
    <p num="0885">The above described state may be produced both at
reading and at erasing, only at erasing or only at reading.
The above dimensional relationships may be combined in any
way so long as the electrical insulation can be obtained.

931 to 934 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line
B-B', respectively, in Fig. 13 which is a plan view illustrating
a memory cell array of a DRAM.</p>
    <p num="0888">Production steps are the same as those of Production
example until the silicon oxide films 2415, 2416 and 2417
containing arsenic impurities of about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>22</sup>
/cm<sup>3</sup> are disposed by CVD on the sides of the semiconductor
layers 2110 in the regions for forming an impurity diffusion
layer, and the third trench 2230 is formed. At this time, the
silicon oxide film 2416 as the third insulating film may be
etched back to such a degree that the silicon nitride film
2321 as the fourth insulating film is exposed.</p>
    <p num="0889">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 2342, for example,
is deposited as a sixth insulating film to a thickness of about
5 to 50 nm and is thermally treated to diffuse the impurities
contained in the silicon oxide films 2415, 2416 and 2417 into
the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 (Figs. 927 and 931).
The impurity introduction from the surface of the island-like
semiconductor layer 2110 may be carried out during the
formation of the island-like semiconductor layer 2110.
Means for the implantation are not particularly limited so
long as an impurity concentration distribution is almost equal
over the island-like semiconductor layers 2110.</p>
    <p num="0890">Then, the silicon nitride film 2342 (the sixth
insulating film) is removed by isotropic etching, and the 
silicon oxide films 2416 and 2417 as well as the silicon oxide
films 2422 and 2424 are removed by isotropic etching.</p>
    <p num="0891">Then, the surface of each island-like semiconductor
layer 2110 is oxidized to form, for example, a thermally
oxidized film 2450 of about 10 to 100 nm thick as a ninth
insulating film (Figs. 928 and 932). The thermally oxidized
film 2450 is etched away from the periphery of each
island-like semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by
isotropic etching.</p>
    <p num="0892">Then, as required, channel ion implantation is
carried out into the sidewall of each island semiconductor
layer 2110 by slant ion implantation. For example, the ion
implantation may be performed at an implantation energy of 5
to 100 keV at an boron dose of about 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 1 ×
10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> at an angle of 5 to 45° with respect to the normal
line of the surface of the substrate. Preferably the channel
ion implantation is performed from various directions to the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110 because a surface
impurity concentration becomes more uniform. Alternatively,
instead of the channel ion implantation, an oxide film
containing boron may be deposited by CVD with a view to
utilizing diffusion of boron from the oxide film. The impurity
implantation from the surface of the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110 may be carried out before the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110 are covered with the
thermally oxidized film 2450, or during the formation of the
island-like semiconductor layers 2110. Alternatively, the
impurities may be introduced to the silicon oxide films 2422
and 2424 in advance with a view to implanting the impurities 
in the island-like semiconductor layers 2110 by thermal
treatment or the like before removing the silicon oxide films
2422 and 2424. Means for the implantation are not
particularly limited so long as an impurity concentration
distribution is almost equal over the island-like
semiconductor layers 2110.</p>
    <p num="0893">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 2460, for example,
is formed as a tenth insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film
to a thickness of about 10 nm around each island-like
semiconductor layer 2110, for example, by thermal
oxidization. The tunnel oxide film, however, may be formed
of not only a thermally oxidized film but also a CVD oxide film
or a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0894">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 2510, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50

insulating film) as a mask, the polysilicon film 2510 is divided
into polysilicon films 2511, 2512, 2513 and 2514, for example,
by anisotropic etching (Figs. 929 and 933).</p>
    <p num="0895">Production steps thereafter (Figs. 930 and 934)

967 to 994 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line
B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1 which illustrates a memory cell
array of an EEPROM. </p>
    <p num="0899">First, on the surface of a P-type silicon substrate
1100, a silicon oxide film 1410, for example, is deposited to 2
to 20 nm as a first insulating film to be an implantation
protection film, and a first impurity diffusion layer 1710 is
introduced into the p-type silicon substrate 1100 using ion
implantation (Fig. 939 and Fig. 967). For example, the ion
implantation may be performed at an implantation energy of 5
to 100 keV at an arsenic dose of about 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>
in a direction inclined about 0 to 7° . Instead of the ion
implantation, an oxide film containing arsenic may be
deposited by CVD, and arsenic diffusion from the oxide film
may be utilized. The first impurity diffusion layer 1710 need
not necessarily be introduced on the topmost surface of the
P-type silicon substrate 1100.</p>
    <p num="0900">Subsequently, using as a mask a resist film R5
patterned by a known photolithography technique (Fig. 940
and Fig. 968), the first insulating film 1410 and the P-type
silicon substrate 1100 are etched 200 to 2000 nm, for
example, by RIE so as to divide the first impurity diffusion
layer 1710 to form a second trench 1220.</p>
    <p num="0901">After the resist film R5 is removed (Fig. 941 and Fig.
969), a silicon oxide film 1420, for example, is deposited to
100 to 300 nm as a fifth insulating film in the second trench
1220 and etched back to be buried. Means for burying the
silicon oxide film 1420 is not particularly limited, and the
silicon oxide film 1420 may be etched back using isotropic
etching, etched back using anisotropic etching, buried by
flattening using CMP or by a combination of these means.
The silicon oxide film 1420 may be a silicon nitride film. The 
silicon oxide film 1410 may be removed or may be retained.</p>
    <p num="0902">For example, in the case where the silicon oxide film
1410 is removed, a silicon oxide film 1471 is formed to 50 to
500 nm as a ninth insulating film on the P-type silicon
substrate 1100 or on the first impurity diffusion layer 1710.
Subsequently, a polysilicon film 1511 is deposited to 100 to
1000 nm as a first conductive film. Thus silicon oxide films
1471 to 1475 as ninth insulating films and polysilicon films
1511 to 1514 as first conductive films are formed sequentially
and alternately. On the silicon oxide film 1475, a silicon
nitride film 1320 is deposited to 100 to 1000 nm as a tenth
insulating film (Fig. 942 and Fig. 970). At this time, the
silicon oxide films 1471 to 1475 may have different
thicknesses or may have the same thickness. The first
conductive films 1511 to 1514 may have different thicknesses
or may have the same thickness.</p>
    <p num="0903">Thereafter, using as a mask a resist film R6
patterned by a known photolithography technique (Fig. 943
and Fig. 971), the silicon nitride film 1320 is patterned, for
example, by RIE (Fig. 944 and Fig. 972).</p>
    <p num="0904">Subsequently, a silicon nitride film 1330, for example,
is formed in the form of a sidewall as an eleventh insulating
film on the sidewall of the silicon nitride film 1320 (Fig. 945
and Fig. 973). Using the silicon nitride film 1320 and the
silicon nitride film 1330 as a mask, the silicon oxide films
1472 to 1475 and the polysilicon films 1511 to 1514 are
anisotropically etched sequentially (Fig. 946 and Fig. 974)
until the time when the first conductive film 1511 is removed,
i.e., until the ninth insulating film 1472 is exposed, to form a 
third trench 1230.</p>
    <p num="0905">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 1521, for example, is
deposited to 20 to 200 nm as a second conductive film (Fig.
947 and Fig. 975).</p>
    <p num="0906">Next, the polysilicon film 1521 is etched back to form
a sidewall on the sidewall of the polysilicon film 1511 (Fig.
948 and Fig. 976). At this time,
the polysilicon film
1521 is formed as a second wiring layer to be a selection gate
line continuous in the direction without using a masking
process.</p>
    <p num="0907">Thereafter, a silicon nitride film 1342, for example, is
deposited to 2 to 20 nm as a twelfth insulating film on the
sidewall of the third trench 1230(Fig. 949 and Fig. 977).</p>
    <p num="0908">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 1422, for example,
is deposited to 50 to 500 nm as a fifth insulating film in the
third trench 1230. Next, the silicon oxide film 1422 is
buried by isotropic etching so as to remain only on the
sidewall of the silicon oxide film 1472 in the third trench
1230 (Fig. 950 and Fig. 978), and then, the silicon nitride film
1342 is selectively removed, for example, by isotropic etching.</p>
    <p num="0909">Further, an interlayer insulating film 1612 is formed
on the surface of the third trench 1230 and the polysilicon
films 1512 to 1514 (Fig. 951 and Fig. 979). This interlayer
insulating film 1612 is formed of an ONO film. The ONO film
can be formed in the same manner as Production example 1.</p>
    <p num="0910">Subsequently, in the same manner as described
above, a polysilicon film 1522 is deposited to 15 to 150 nm as 
a second conductive film (Fig. 952 and Fig. 980) and etched
back to form a sidewall on the sidewall of the polysilicon film
1512 (Fig. 953 and Fig. 981). At this time, by setting the
intervals between the third trenches 1230 to a predetermined
value or smaller in the A-A' direction in Fig.1, the polysilicon
film 152 2 is formed as a third wiring layer to be a control
gate line continuous in the direction without using a masking
process.</p>
    <p num="0911">Thereafter, by repeating the above production steps,
a silicon oxide film 1423, for example, is buried as fifth
insulating film in the third trench 1230 so as to remain only
on the side of a silicon oxide film 1473 as a ninth insulating
film (Fig. 954 and Fig. 982), and then, the interlayer
insulating film 1612 is selectively removed by isotropic
etching.</p>
    <p num="0912">Subsequently, an interlayer insulating film 1613 is
formed on the surface of the third trench 1230 and the
polysilicon films 1513 and 1514.</p>
    <p num="0913">Next, a polysilicon film 1523, for example, is
deposited to 15 to 150 nm as a second conductive film and
etched back to form a sidewall on the sidewall of the
polysilicon film 1513. Further, by repeating in the same
manner, a silicon oxide film 1424 is buried as a fifth
insulating film in the third trench 1230 so as to remain only
on the side of a silicon oxide film 1474 as a ninth insulating
film (Fig. 955 and Fig. 983).</p>
    <p num="0914">The interlayer insulating film 1613 is selectively
removed, for example, by isotropic etching. Thereafter, in
the state in which the surface of the third trench 1230 and 
the polysilicon film 1514 is exposed (Fig. 956 and Fig. 984), a
polysilicon film 1524 is deposited to 15 to 150 nm as a
second conductive film and etched back to form a sidewall on
the sidewall of the polysilicon film 1514 (Fig. 957 and Fig.
985).</p>
    <p num="0915">Further in the same manner, a silicon oxide film
1425 is buried as a fifth insulating film in the third trench
1230 on the side of a silicon oxide film 1475 as a ninth
insulating film or on the side of a silicon nitride film 1330 as
an eleventh insulating film (Fig. 958 and Fig. 986), and a
silicon nitride film 1350, for example, is deposited as a
fourteenth insulating film. Thereafter, the surface of the
silicon nitride film 1350 is flattened, for example, by CMP (Fig.
959 and Fig. 987). Using as a mask a resist film R7
patterned by a known photolithography (Fig. 960 and Fig.
988), the silicon nitride film 1350, the silicon nitride film
1330 or the silicon nitride film 1320 is patterned, for example,
by RIE.</p>
    <p num="0916">Subsequently, the silicon oxide films 1471 to 1475
and the polysilicon films 1511 to 1514 are sequentially etched,
for example, by anisotropic etching until the time when the
silicon oxide film 1471 is removed, i.e., until the surface of
the P-type silicon substrate 1100 is exposed, to form a first
trench 1210 (Fig. 961 and Fig.989).</p>
    <p num="0917">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 1440, for example,
is formed as a third insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film
of about 10 nm on the inner wall of the first trench 1210, for
example, using CVD (Fig. 962 and Fig. 990). Here, the
silicon oxide film 1440 is not particularly limited to a CVD 
oxide film, but may be a thermally oxidized film or a nitrogen
oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0918">Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 1440 on the first
diffusion layer 1710 or on the P-type silicon substrate 1100 is
selectively removed. For example, by anisotropic etching,
the silicon oxide film 1440 is left in the form of a sidewall
only on the sidewall of the first trench 1210 (Fig. 963 and Fig.
991).</p>
    <p num="0919">Thereafter, the silicon oxide film 1440 is, for example,
annealed in a nitrogen atmosphere at 800 to 1000°C for 10 to
100 minutes. At this time, a gas other then nitrogen, for
example, oxygen may be added. Preferably the silicon oxide
film 1440 becomes about 10 nm thick after the thermal
treatment.</p>
    <p num="0920">Thereafter, the oxide film formed on the surface of
the first impurity diffusion layer 1710 or on the P-type silicon
substrate 1100 is optionally removed, for example, with
diluted HF, and the first trench 1210 is filled with island-like
semiconductor layers 1721 to 1725 and 1111 to 1114. For
example, the semiconductor layers are selectively grown
epitaxially from the first impurity diffusion layer 1710 or the
P-type silicon substrate 1100 positioned at the bottom of the
first trench 1210. At this time, from the bottom, an N-type
semiconductor layer 1721, a P-type semiconductor layer 1111,
an N-type semiconductor layer1722, a P-type semiconductor
layer 1112, an N-type semiconductor layer 1723, a P-type
semiconductor layer 1113, an N-type semiconductor layer
1724, a P-type semiconductor layer 1114 and an N-type
semiconductor layer 1725 are sequentially formed (Fig. 964 
and Fig. 992). The concentration of the N-type
semiconductor layers 1721 to 1725 is formed at an arsenic
dose of about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, and the concentration
of the P-type semiconductor layers 1111 to 1114 is formed at
a boron dose of about 1 × 10<sup>15</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. Preferably,
the N-type semiconductor layers 1721 and 1722 overlap each
other with intervention of the polysilicon layer 1511 and the
silicon oxide film 1440; the N-type semiconductor layers 1722
and 1723 overlap each other with intervention of the
polysilicon layer 1512 and the silicon oxide film 1440; the
N-type semiconductor layers 1723 and 1724 overlap each

1724 and 1725 overlap each other with intervention of the
polysilicon layer 1514 and the silicon oxide film 1440.</p>
    <p num="0921">Thereafter, the N-type semiconductor layer 1725 is
reduced, for example, by etch back or by CMP to expose the
silicon oxide film 1425 and divide the N-type semiconductor
layer.</p>
    <p num="0922">Subsequently, a fourth wiring layer 1840 is
connected to the top of the N-type semiconductor layer 1725
so as to cross the direction of the second and third wiring

    <p num="0923">Thereafter, an interlayer insulating film is formed by
a known technique, and contact holes and metal wiring are
formed. Thereby a semiconductor memory device is realized
which has a memory function according to the state of a

as the second conductive films may be performed when the
polysilicon films are formed, after the polysilicon films are

polysilicon film 1514 as a first conductive film, and a silicon
nitride film 1385 as an eighteenth insulating film, for
example. </p>
    <p num="0950">Subsequently, using as a mask a resist film R2
patterned by a known photolithography technique (Fig. 1017
and Fig. 1040), etching is performed, for example, by RIE
until the silicon nitride film 1381 is reached, so as to form a
third trench (Fig. 1018 and Fig. 1041).</p>
    <p num="0951">Thereafter, the polysilicon films 1511 to 1514 are
isotropically etched (Fig. 1019 and Fig. 1042) to reduce the
diameter of the polysilicon films 1511 to 1514 as compared
with the diameter of the silicon nitride films 1382 to 1385.</p>
    <p num="0952">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 1421 is deposited
to 50 to 500nm as a fifth insulating film by CVD in the third
trench 1230. Thereafter, the silicon oxide film 1421 is
buried almost to the height of the top of the polysilicon film
1511, for example, by isotropic etching (Fig. 1020 and Fig.
1043). A silicon nitride film 1390, for example, is deposited
to about 10 to 200 nm as a nineteenth insulating film on the
surface of the polysilicon films 1512 to 1514 and the silicon
nitride films 1382 to 1385.</p>
    <p num="0953">The silicon nitride film 1390 is anisotropically etched
to form a sidewall (Fig. 1021 and Fig. 1004), and then, the
silicon oxide film 1421 is removed by isotropic etching (Fig.
1022 and Fig. 1045).</p>
    <p num="0954">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 1521, for example, is
deposited to 100 to 500 nm as a second conductive film and
is etched back to form a sidewall on the sidewall of the
polysilicon film 1511 (Fig. 1023 and Fig. 1046). At this time,
by setting the intervals between the third trenches 1230 to a
predetermined value or smaller in the A-A' direction in Fig.1,
the polysilicon film 1521 is formed as a second wiring layer to 
be a selection gate line continuous in the direction without
using a masking process.</p>
    <p num="0955">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 1421 is deposited
50 to 500 nm as a fifth insulating film in the third trench.
The silicon oxide film 1421 is buried almost to the height of
the top of the silicon nitride film 1382, for example, by
isotropic etching (Fig. 1024 and Fig. 1047), and then, an
interlayer insulating film 1612 is formed on the surface of the
polysilicon films 1512 to 1514 and the silicon nitride films
1383 to 1385 (Fig. 1025 and Fig. 1048). This interlayer
insulating film is formed of an ONO film, for example. The
ONO film can be formed in the same manner as in Production
Example 1.</p>
    <p num="0956">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 1522 is deposited to
about 100 to 500 nm as a second conductive film and is
buried almost to the height of the top of the silicon nitride
film 1384, for example, by isotropic etching (Fig. 1026 and Fig.
1049). Thereafter, the interlayer insulating film 1612
deposited on the surface of the polysilicon film 1514 and on
the surface of the silicon nitride film 1385 is removed, for
example, by isotropic etching (Fig. 1027 and Fig. 1050).
Next, a polysilicon film 1524, for example, is deposited to
about 100 to 500 nm as a second conductive film (Fig. 1028
and Fig. 1051).</p>
    <p num="0957">Thereafter, the polysilicon films 1524 and 1522 are
anisotropically etched in self-alignment with the interlayer
insulating film 1612 deposited on the sidewalls of the silicon
nitride film 1385 and the silicon nitride film 1384 (Fig. 1029
and Fig. 1052) so that the polysilicon film 1522 is buried in 
the recesses of the polysilicon films 1512 to 1513 sandwiched
between the silicon nitride films 1382 to 1384, with
intervention of the interlayer insulating film 1612.</p>
    <p num="0958">Thereby, the polysilicon film 1522 is arranged on the
side of the polysilicon film 1512 with intervention of the
interlayer insulating film 1612, and the polysilicon film 1523
is arranged on the side of the polysilicon film 1513 with
intervention of the interlayer insulating film 1612. The
polysilicon film 1524 as the second conductive film need not
necessarily be formed.</p>
    <p num="0959">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 1532, for example, is
deposited to about 50 to 200 nm as third conductive film and
is etched back to form a sidewall on the side of the polysilicon
film 1512 with intervention of the interlayer insulating film
1612 (Fig. 1030 and Fig. 1053). At this time, by setting the
intervals between the third trenches 1230 to a predetermined
value or smaller in the A-A' direction in Fig.1, the polysilicon
film 1532 is formed as a second wiring layer to be a selection
gate line continuous in the direction without using a masking
process.</p>
    <p num="0960">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 1422, for example, is
deposited to 50 o 500 nm as a fifth insulting film, and then,
is buried almost to the height of the top of the silicon nitride
film 1383, for example, by isotropic etching. Thereafter, by
repeating the above-described steps, a sidewall is formed of a
polysilicon film 1533 as a third conductive film on the side of
the polysilicon film 1513 with intervention of the interlayer
insulating film 1513 (Fig. 1031 and Fig. 1054).</p>
    <p num="0961">Next, a silicon oxide film 1423, for example, is

Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 1423 is buried almost to

example, by isotropic etching. Then a polysilicon film 1534,
for example, is deposited to about 50 to 200 nm as a third
conductive film, and then etched back to form a sidewall of
the polysilicon film 1534 on the side of the polysilicon film
1513 (Fig. 1032 and Fig. 1055).</p>
    <p num="0962">Thereafter, the silicon nitride film 1385 is removed
by isotropic etching. A silicon oxide film 1491, for example,
is deposited to about 50 to 500 nm as a twentieth insulating
film. Using as a mask a resist film R1 patterned by a known
photolithography technique (Fig. 1033 and Fig. 1056), etching
is performed by RIE until reached the first impurity diffusion
layer 1710, thereby to form a first trench 1210 (Fig. 1034 and
Fig. 1057).</p>
    <p num="0963">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 1440, for example,
is formed as a third insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film
of about 10 nm in the inner wall of the first trench, for
example, using CVD. Here, the third insulating film is not
particularly limited to a CVD oxide film, but may be a
thermally oxidized film or a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="0964">Thereafter, the silicon oxide film 1440 positioned on
the first impurity diffusion layer 1710 is selectively removed,
for example, by anisotropic etching so that the silicon oxide
film 1440 remains in the form of a sidewall only on the
sidewall of the first trench 1210 (Fig. 1035 and Fig. 1058).</p>
    <p num="0965">Thereafter, the silicon oxide film 1440 is treated, for
example, by thermal treatment. This treatment can be 
conducted in the same manner as in Production Example 45.</p>
    <p num="0966">Thereafter, the oxide film formed on the surface of
the first impurity diffusion layer 1710 is optionally removed,
for example, with diluted HF, and the first trench 1210 is
filled with island-like semiconductor layers 1721 to 1725 and
1111 to 1114. For example, the semiconductor layers are
selectively grown epitaxially from the first impurity diffusion
layer 1710 positioned at the bottom of the first trench 1210.
At this time, from the bottom, an N-type semiconductor layer
1721, a P-type semiconductor layer 1111, an N-type
semiconductor layer1722, a P-type semiconductor layer 1112,
an N-type semiconductor layer 1723, a P-type semiconductor
layer 1113, an N-type semiconductor layer 1724, a P-type
semiconductor layer 1114 and an N-type semiconductor layer
1725 are sequentially formed. The concentration of the
N-type semiconductor layers 1721 to 1725 is formed at an
arsenic dose of about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, and the
concentration of the P-type semiconductor layers 1111 to
1114 is formed at a boron dose of about 1 × 10<sup>15</sup> to 1 ×
10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. Preferably, the N-type semiconductor layers 1721
and 1722 overlap each other with intervention of the
polysilicon layer 1511 and the silicon oxide film 1440; the
N-type semiconductor layers 1722 and 1723 overlap each
other with intervention of the polysilicon layer 1512 and the
silicon oxide film 1440; the N-type semiconductor layers 1723

the N-type semiconductor layers 1724 and 1725 overlap each
other with intervention of the polysilicon layer 1514 and the 
silicon oxide film 1440.</p>
    <p num="0967">Thereafter, the N-type semiconductor layer 1725 is
reduced, for example, by etch back or by CMP to expose the
silicon oxide film 1425 and divide the N-type semiconductor
layer (Fig. 1036 and Fig. 1059).</p>
    <p num="0968">Subsequently, a fourth wiring layer is connected to
the top of the N-type semiconductor layer 1725 so as to cross
the direction of the second and third wiring layers.</p>
    <p num="0969">Thereafter, an interlayer insulating film is formed by
a known technique, and contact holes and metal wiring are
formed (Fig. 1037 and Fig. 1060).</p>
    <p num="0970">Thereby a semiconductor memory device is realized
which has a memory function according to the state of a
charge in the charge storage layer which is the floating gate
made of the polysilicon film as the first conductive film.</p>
    <p num="0971">The impurity introduction into the polysilicon films
1511 to 1514 as the first conductive films, the polysilicon
films 1521 to 1524 as the second conductive films and the
polysilicon films 1532 to 1534 as the third conductive films
may be performed when the polysilicon films are formed, after
the polysilicon films are formed or after the sidewalls are
formed. The timing of introducing the impurity is not limited
so long as the conductive film is formed.</p>
    <p num="0972">In this production example, the control gates of the
memory cells are formed continuously in one direction
without using a mask. However, that is possible only in the
case where the island-like semiconductor layers are not
disposed symmetrically to a diagonal. In contrast, if the
island-like semiconductor layers are disposed symmetrically 
to a diagonal, for example, the wiring layers may be separated
through patterning with use of resist films by
photolithography.</p>
    <p num="0973">By providing the selection gates in the top and the
bottom of a set of memory cells, it is possible to prevent the
phenomenon that a memory cell transistor is over-erased.

    <p num="0974">In a semiconductor memory device to be formed in
this example, after regions where charge storage layers and
selection gates are formed are to be pre-defined by laminated
films including floating gates as charge storage layer, tunnel
oxide films are formed in hole-form trenches opened using a
photoresist mask. Island-like semiconductor layer are
formed in the form of pillars by selective epitaxial silicon
growth and are electrically floated with respect to a
semiconductor substrate. Active regions of memory cells are
electrically in common. In this semiconductor memory
device, selection gate transistors are disposed at the top and
at the bottom of each island-like semiconductor layer. A
plurality of, for example, two memory cells are disposed
between the selection gate transistors. The tunnel oxide
films of the memory cells are formed at the same time. The
memory cells are connected in series along the island-like
semiconductor layer. The gate insulating films of the
selection gate transistors have the same thickness of the gate
insulating films of the memory transistors. Transfer gates
are formed between the transistors for transferring potential
to the active regions of the memory transistors.</p>

as the twelfth insulating film and the silicon nitride film 1350
as the fourteenth insulating film are exposed to divide the
N-type semiconductor layer 1725 (Fig. 1061 and fig. 1064).</p>
    <p num="0977">Thereafter, isotropically etched are the silicon nitride

and the silicon oxide films 1472, 1473, 1474 and 1475 as the
ninth insulating film. At this time, the silicon oxide films
1472, 1473, 1474 and 1475 are removed, and further, the
silicon oxide film 1440 as the third insulating film between
the silicon oxide films 1472, 1473, 1474, 1475 and the
island-like semiconductor layer 111 or the impurity diffusion

removed (Fig. 1062 and Fig. 1065). Or the silicon oxide film
1440 as the third insulating film between the silicon oxide

or 1725 as the N-type semiconductor layer is removed. After 
the silicon oxide films 1472, 1473, 1474, 1475 are removed,
and further, portions of the interlayer insulating film 1612
and 1613 exposed by the etching of the silicon oxide films
1472, 1473, 1474, 1475 are etched.</p>
    <p num="0978">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 1400, for example,
is deposited to about 5 to 50 nm as a twenty-first insulating
film, and then, a polysilicon film 1530, for example, is
deposited to about 30 to 300 nm as a third conductive film.
Thereafter, the polysilicon film 1530 is etched back to a
degree such that at least the top surface of the impurity

    <p num="0979">Next, a silicon oxide film 1426, for example, is
deposited to about 50 to 500 nm as a twenty-second

    <p num="0982">First, on the surface of a P-type silicon substrate
1100, a silicon oxide film 1410, for example, is deposited to 2

protection film, and a first impurity diffusion layer 1710 is
introduced into the p-type silicon substrate 1100 using ion
implantation (Fig. 1067 and Fig. 1094). For example, the ion
implantation may be performed at an implantation energy of 5
to 100 keV at an arsenic dose of about 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>
in a direction inclined about 0 to 7° . Instead of the ion

deposited by CVD, and arsenic diffusion from the oxide film
may be utilized. The first impurity diffusion layer 1710 need
not necessarily be introduced on the topmost surface of the
P-type silicon substrate 1100.</p>
    <p num="0983">Subsequently, using as a mask a resist film R5
patterned by a known photolithography technique, the P-type
silicon substrate 1100 are etched 200 to 2000 nm, for

1420 is not particularly limited, and the silicon oxide film
1420 may be etched back using isotropic etching, etched back
using anisotropic etching, buried by flattening using CMP or
by a combination of these means. The silicon oxide film
1420 may be a silicon nitride film. The silicon oxide film

in a direction inclined about 0 to 7° . Instead of the ion

may be utilized. The first impurity diffusion layer 1710 need
not necessarily be introduced on the topmost surface of the
P-type silicon substrate 1100.</p>
    <p num="1019">Subsequently, using as a mask a resist film R5

connected to the buried wiring layers 1521, 1522, 1523, 1524
and 1710 for the application of voltage to the buried wiring
layers from outside.</p>
    <p num="1108">The first, second and third wiring layers buried in
wiring layer lead-out portions are stepwise arranged. First,
second and third contacts 1921, 1932, 1933, 1924 and 1910
are formed from end portions of the wiring layers so that the
contacts are contacted only with desired wiring layers, and
thereby the first, second and third wiring layers are lead out
onto the top of the semiconductor memory device (Figs. 1247
to 1252).</p>
    <p num="1109">Alternatively, conductive films may be taken out onto
the semiconductor memory device instead of forming the first,
second and third contacts 1921, 1932, 1933, 1924 and 1910.
With this construction, the same effect as described above
can be obtained.</p>
    <p num="1110">Further the first, second and third wiring layers
buried in the wiring layer lead-out portions may be lead out
onto the top of the semiconductor memory device in the
following process. The wiring layers are arranged as shown
in Fig.1247 to Fig. 1252. The first, second and third
contacts 1921, 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1910 are opened, and
then, a silicon oxide film 1499, for example, is deposited to
10 to 100 nm as a twenty-third insulating film and etched
back by a deposited thickness. Thereby sidewalls are formed
of the silicon oxide film 1499 on the inner walls of the
contacts formed in the wiring layer lead-out portions. At 
this time, the twenty-third insulating film is not particularly
limited to a silicon oxide film, but may be an insulating film
such as a silicon nitride film. Thereafter, a metallic or
conductive film is filled in the contacts, and thereby, the first,
second and third wiring layers are lead out onto the top of the
semiconductor memory device (Fig. 1253 and Fig. 1258).</p>
    <p num="1111">The contacts for leading out the wiring layers may be
formed in common to wiring layers of adjacent memory cells
that are continuous in the A-A' direction as shown in Figs.
1253 to 1258 or may be formed in each wiring layer lead-out
portion as shown in Fig. 1247 to 1252.</p>
    <p num="1112">Leading the first, second and third wiring layers out
onto the top of the semiconductor memory device is
applicable to all the examples of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="1113">In the above-described production examples, after a
plurality of charge storage layers are formed, island-like
semiconductor layers 1110 are formed in the form of pillars
by selective epitaxial silicon growth; before the active regions
are formed of the semiconductor substrate or semiconductor
layers, regions to be the charge storage layers are defined by
multi-layered film and the charge storage layers are formed in
these regions; a plurality of memory cells having charge
storage layers and control gates are connected in series in the
direction perpendicular to the surface of the semiconductor
substrate and these memory cells are formed on the
semiconductor substrate and the sidewalls of the island-like
semiconductor layers which are arranged in matrix and
separated in the lattice form on the semiconductor substrate;
impurity diffusion layers disposed on the island-like 
semiconductor layers form sources or drains of the memory
cells and the impurity diffusion layers electrically separate
the substrate from the island-like semiconductor layers;
control gates have control gate lines which are formed
continuously with respect to a plurality of island-like
semiconductor layers in one direction and horizontally with
respect to the surface of the semiconductor substrate; and bit
lines are electrically connected with the impurity diffusion
layers in a direction crossing the control gate lines and are
arranged horizontally with respect to the surface of the
semiconductor substrate. However the production steps and
the constructions of the semiconductor memory device shown
in the examples may be optionally combined.</p>
    <p num="1114">Hereinafter, described is a production process for
producing a semiconductor memory in which, charge storage
layers or control gates are formed, insulating films are formed
between the charge storage layers and a semiconductor
substrate or a semiconductor layer at the same time, and
then semiconductor layers in the form of pillars to be active
regions are formed on the sides of the insulating films. For
forming gate electrodes in the form of sidewall spacers, an
insulating film is buried in advance in an adjacent trench and
etching is carried out in a horizontal direction using the
insulating film as a mask. Thereby the gate electrodes are
formed accurately by etching to a depth corresponding to the
deposit thickness of a material for the gate electrodes.</p>
    <heading>Production Example 69</heading>
    <p num="1115">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this
example, a plurality of floating gates are formed as charge 
storage layers and selection gates and control gates are
formed. Then, tunnel oxide films are formed and island-like
semiconductor layers in a pillar form are formed by selective
epitaxial silicon growth. The island-like semiconductor
layers are each in an electrically floating state with respect to
the semiconductor substrate. The active region of each
memory cell is in the electrically floating state. Selection
gate transistors are disposed at the top and the bottom of the
island-like semiconductor layer. A plurality of memory
transistors, for example, two memory transistors, are placed
between the selection gate transistors. Tunnel oxide films of
the transistors are formed at the same time. The transistors
are connected in series along the island-like semiconductor
layer. Further, the thickness of gate insulating films of the
selection gate transistors is equal to the thickness of gate
insulating films of the memory transistors.</p>
    <p num="1116">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by
the following process. Figs. 1259 to 1283 and Figs. 1284 to
1308 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line B-B',
respectively, in Fig. 1 illustrating an EEPROM memory cell
array.</p>
    <p num="1117">First, on a surface of a p-type silicon substrate 1100,
a silicon oxide film 1410 is deposited as a first insulating film
to be an implantation protective film to a thickness of 2 to 20
nm and a first impurity layer 1710 is formed on the p-type
silicon substrate 1100 by ion implantation (Figs. 1259 and
1284). For example, the ion implantation may be performed
at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at an arsenic dose
of about 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> in a direction inclined by 
about 0 to 7° with respect to the normal line of the surface of
the substrate. Alternatively, instead of the channel ion
implantation, an oxide film containing arsenic may be
deposited by CVD with a view to utilizing diffusion of arsenic
from the oxide film. The first impurity layer 1710 may not
be formed on the topmost surface of the p-type silicon
substrate 1100.</p>
    <p num="1118">Using a resist film R5 patterned by a known
photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 1260 and 1285),
the first insulating film 1410 and the p-type silicon substrate
1100 are etched by 200 to 2,000 nm by reactive ion etching
so that the first impurity layer 1710 is separated, thereby
forming a second trench 1220.</p>
    <p num="1119">After the resist film R5 is removed (Figs. 1261 and
1286), a silicon oxide film 1420, for example, is deposited as
a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 100 to 300 nm and
buried in the second trench 1220 by etch-back. The silicon
oxide film 1420 may be buried by isotropic or anisotropic
etch-back, CMP, or a combination in various ways. At this
time, the silicon oxide film 1420 may be a silicon nitride film.
The silicon oxide film 1410 may be removed or may remain.</p>
    <p num="1120">For example, if the silicon oxide film 1410 is removed,
a silicon nitride film 1310, for example, is formed as a second
insulating film to a thickness of 2,000 to 20,000 nm on the
p-type silicon substrate 1100 or the first impurity layer 1710
(Figs. 1262 and 1287).</p>
    <p num="1121">Subsequently, using a resist film R6 patterned by a
known photolithographic technique as a mask (Figs. 1263 and
1288), the silicon nitride film 1310 is etched by reactive ion 
etching, for example, to form a fourth trench 1240 in a lattice
form. Then, a silicon oxide film 1421, for example, is
deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500
nm by CVD in the lattice-form fourth trench 1240.</p>
    <p num="1122">Thereafter, the silicon oxide film 1421 is buried in
the fourth trench 1240 to a desired depth, for example, by
isotropic etching (Figs. 1264 and 1289). On the surface of
the silicon nitride film 1310, a silicon oxide film 1431, for
example, is deposited as a fourth insulating film to a
thickness of 1 to 10 nm and a polysilicon film 1511, for
example, is deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness
of about 100 to 500 nm (Figs. 1265 and 1290).</p>
    <p num="1123">The polysilicon film 1511 is then etched back into
the form of a sidewall spacer of a desired height (Figs. 1266
and 1291). At this time, by setting the intervals between the
fourth trenches 1240 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a
predetermined value or smaller, the polysilicon film 1511 is
formed into a second wiring layer to be a selection gate line
continuous in the direction without need to use a masking
process.</p>
    <p num="1124">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 1422, for example, is
deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500
nm in the fourth trench 1240 and buried in the fourth trench
1240 to a desired depth by isotropic etching. Then, on the
surface of the silicon nitride film 1310, a silicon oxide film
1432, for example, is deposited as a fourth insulating film to
a thickness of 1 to 10 nm (Figs. 1267 and 1292) and a
polysilicon film 1512, for example, is deposited as a first
conductive film to a thickness of about 50 to 200 nm (Figs. 
1268 and 1293).</p>
    <p num="1125">In the same manner, the polysilicon film 1512 is
etched back into the form of a sidewall spacer of a desired
height (Figs. 1269 and 1294). At this time, the polysilicon
films 1512 (the first conductive films) are formed to surround
the silicon nitride film 1310, respectively, and isolated from
each other.</p>
    <p num="1126">Subsequently, an interlayer insulating film 1612 is
formed on the surface of the polysilicon film 1512 (Fig. 1270
and Fig. 1295). This interlayer insulating film 1612 may be
formed of an ONO film. The ONO film can be formed in the
same manner as Production example 1.</p>
    <p num="1127">Then, in the same manner, a polysilicon film 1522,
for example, is deposited as a second conductive film to a
thickness of 15 to 150 nm (Figs. 1271 and 1296) and etched
back to a depth corresponding to the deposit thickness,
thereby the interlayer insulating film 1612 on the silicon
oxide film 1422 is exposed and the polysilicon film 1522 is
disposed on the side of the polysilicon film 1512 (the first
conductive film) with intervention of the interlayer insulating
film 1612. At this time, a polysilicon film 1526 (a second
conductive film) remains around the silicon nitride film 1310.
Preferably the polysilicon film 1522 and the polysilicon film
1526 are separated (Figs. 1272 and 1297). At this time, by
setting the intervals between the fourth trenches 1240 in a
direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined value or smaller,
the polysilicon film 1522 is formed into a third wiring layer to
be a control gate line continuous in the direction without
need to use a masking process. </p>
    <p num="1128">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 1423, for example, is
deposited as a fifth insulating film in the fourth trench 1240
to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm, and then buried in the fourth
trench 1240 to a desired depth by isotropic etching (Figs.
1273 and 1298). Using the silicon oxide film 1423 as a mask,
the exposed polysilicon film 1526 is removed by isotropic
etching (Figs. 1274 and 1299). At this time, the etching is
performed in an etching amount corresponding to the
thickness of the polysilicon film 1526. Thereby, variations in
the production process can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="1129">Subsequently, the polysilicon film 1526 remaining
between the silicon nitride film 1310 and the silicon oxide
film 1423 is removed by isotropic or anisotropic etching (Figs.
1275 and 1300).</p>
    <p num="1130">Then, a silicon oxide film 1483, for example, is
deposited as a sixth insulating film to a thickness of 8 to 80
nm such that it is buried in a space between the silicon
nitride film 1310 and the silicon oxide film 1423. At this
time, it is preferred that the thickness of the silicon oxide film
1483 is about half or more of the thickness of the polysilicon
film 1522 (Figs. 1276 and 1301).</p>
    <p num="1131">Then, isotropic etching is performed to a depth
corresponding to the deposit thickness of the silicon oxide
film 1483, thereby the interlayer insulating film 1612 present
on the side of the silicon nitride film 1310 is exposed and the
silicon oxide film 1483 is buried in the fourth trench 1240.</p>
    <p num="1132">Here, explanation is given of the formation of the
polysilicon film 1522 as the second conductive film.
However, the polysilicon film 1522 may be formed into the 
form of a sidewall spacer merely by a combination of
deposition and anisotropic etching. Thereafter, using the
silicon oxide film 1423 as a mask, the interlayer insulating
film 1612 is partially removed by isotropic etching (Figs. 1277
and 1302).</p>
    <p num="1133">By repeating likewise, a polysilicon film 1523 is
disposed as a second conductive film on the side of a
polysilicon film 1513 with intervention of an interlayer
insulating film 1613, and then the polysilicon film 1523 is
buried by forming thereon a silicon oxide film 1424 (a fifth
insulating film) and a silicon oxide film 1484 (a sixth
insulating film) (Figs. 1278 and 1303). With regard to a
polysilicon film 1514 which is the topmost first conductive
film, the polysilicon film 1514 is etched back in the same
manner as the polysilicon film 1511 which is the bottommost
first conductive film.</p>
    <p num="1134">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 1425, for example, is
deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500
nm and the top of the silicon nitride film 1310 is exposed by
etch-back or by CMP (Figs. 1279 and 1304). At this time,
the silicon oxide film 1425 may be a silicon nitride film.</p>
    <p num="1135">Then, the silicon nitride film 1310 is selectively
removed by isotropic etching to form a first trench 1210.
Then, a silicon oxide film 1440 is formed as a third insulating
film to be a tunnel oxide film to a thickness of about 10 nm
by CVD on the inner wall of the first trench 1210 (Figs. 1280
and 1305). The silicon oxide film 1440, however, may be
formed of not only a CVD oxide film but also a thermally
oxidized film or a nitrogen oxide film. </p>
    <p num="1136">Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 1440 formed on
the first impurity diffusion layer 1710 or the p-type silicon
substrate 1100 is selectively removed. For example, the
silicon oxide film 1440 is anisotropically etched to remain in
the form of a sidewall spacer only on the sidewall of the first
trench 1210 (Figs. 1281 and 1306).</p>
    <p num="1137">Thereafter, the silicon oxide film 1440 is subjected to
thermal treatment or the like in a nitrogen atmosphere at 800
to 1,000°C for 10 to 100 minutes. At this time, gases other
than nitrogen, e.g., oxygen, may be added. After the thermal
treatment, the thickness of the silicon oxide film 1440 is
preferably about 10 nm.</p>
    <p num="1138">Then, an oxide film generated on the surface of the
first impurity diffusion layer 1710 or the p-type silicon
substrate 1100 is optionally removed by using diluted HF, for
example, and island-like semiconductor layers 1721 to 1725
and 1111 to 1114 are buried in the first trench 1210. For
example, from the first impurity diffusion layer 1710 or the
p-type silicon substrate 1100 located at the bottom of the
first trench 1210, the semiconductor layers are formed
selectively by epitaxial growth. At this time, from the bottom,
an N-type semiconductor layer 1721, a P-type semiconductor
layer 1111, an N-type semiconductor layer 1722, a P-type
semiconductor layer 1112, an N-type semiconductor layer
1723, a P-type semiconductor layer 1113, an N-type
semiconductor layer 1724, a P-type semiconductor layer 1114,
and an N-type semiconductor layer 1725 are formed
sequentially (Figs. 1282 and 1307). The N-type
semiconductor layers 1721 to 1725 are formed at an arsenic 
concentration of about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> and the P-type
semiconductor layers 1111 to 1114 are formed at a boron
concentration of about 1 × 10<sup>15</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. Further, it is
preferable that the N-type semiconductor layers 1721 and
1722 are overlapped with the polysilicon film 1511 (the first
conductive film) with intervention of the silicon oxide film
1440 (the third insulating film), respectively. In the same
manner, it is preferred that the N-type semiconductor layers
1722 and 1723 are overlapped with the polysilicon film 1512,
the N-type semiconductor layers 1723 and 1724 are
overlapped with the polysilicon film 1513, and the N-type
semiconductor layers 1724 and 1725 are overlapped with the
polysilicon film 1514, with intervention of the silicon oxide
film 1440, respectively.</p>
    <p num="1139">Thereafter, the N-type semiconductor layer 1725 is
reduced by etch-back or CMP, for example, to expose the
silicon oxide film 1425 (the fifth insulating film). Thereby
the N-type semiconductor layer 1725 is separated. Then, a
fourth wiring layer is formed so that its direction crosses the
direction of the second or third wiring layer and is connected
to the top portion of the N-type semiconductor layer 1725.</p>
    <p num="1140">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed. Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized
which has a memory function according to the state of a
charge in the charge storage layer which is the floating gate
made of the polysilicon film (the first conductive film).</p>
    <p num="1141">In this example, films formed on the surface of the
semiconductor substrate or the polysilicon film such as the 
silicon nitride film (the second insulating film) 1310 may be
formed of a layered film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon
nitride film from the silicon surface. With regard to the
polysilicon films 1511 to 1514 (the first conductive films) and
the polysilicon films 1522 and 1523 (the second conductive
films), impurity introduction may be carried out during or
after the formation of the polysilicon films or after the
formation of the sidewall spacer. The timing of the impurity
introduction to the polysilicon films is not particularly limited
so long as these films become conductive films.</p>
    <p num="1142">In this example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a
mask. However, that is possible only where the island-like
semiconductor layers are not disposed symmetrically to a
diagonal. In contrast, if the island-like semiconductor layers
are disposed symmetrically to a diagonal, for example, the
wiring layers may be separated through patterning with use of
resist films by photolithography.</p>
    <p num="1143">Further, by providing the selection gates in the top
and the bottom of a set of memory cells, it is possible to
prevent the phenomenon that a memory cell transistor is
over-erased.</p>
    <p num="1144">The charge storage layer may be formed of not only
the floating gate structure but also a laminated insulating
film. This example is also applicable even if MNOS or
MONOS structure is employed. The laminated insulating
film mentioned herein signifies a laminated structure of a
tunnel oxide film and a silicon nitride film, or a structure
including a tunnel oxide film, a silicon nitride film and a 
silicon oxide film.</p>
    <heading>Production example 70</heading>
    <p num="1145">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this
example, selection gates and control gates are formed, and
laminated insulating films are formed as charge storage
layers. Then, island-like semiconductor layers in a pillar
form are formed by selective epitaxial silicon growth. The
island-like semiconductor layers are each in an electrically
floating state with respect to the semiconductor substrate.
The active region of each memory cell is in the electrically
floating state. Selection gate transistors are disposed at the
top and the bottom of the island-like semiconductor layer. A
plurality of memory transistors, for example, two memory
transistors, are placed between the selection gate transistors.
Tunnel oxide films of the transistors are formed at the same
time. The transistors are connected in series along the
island-like semiconductor layer. Further, the thickness of
gate insulating films of the selection gate transistors is equal
to the thickness of gate insulating films of the memory
transistors.</p>
    <p num="1146">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by
the following process. Figs. 1309 to 1326 and Figs. 1327 to
1344 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line B-B',
respectively, in Fig. 12 illustrating an NMOS or MONOS
memory cell array.</p>
    <p num="1147">This example is same as Production example 69 (Figs.
1259 to 1283 and 1284 to 1308) until the silicon nitride film
1310 is etched by reactive ion etching by using the resist film
R6 as a mask to form the lattice-form fourth trench 1240 
(Figs. 1309 to 1313 and 1327 to 1331).</p>
    <p num="1148">Then, a silicon oxide film 1421, for example, is

preferable that the N-type semiconductor layers 1721 and
1722-1 are overlapped with the polysilicon film 1511 (the first

    <p num="1159">Then, using the N-type semiconductor layer 1722-1
as a mask, the silicon oxide film 1440 is partially removed.</p>
    <p num="1160">Subsequently, a laminated insulating film 1620 to be
charge storage layer is formed on the inner wall of the first
trench 1210 (Figs. 1322 and 1340). In the case of forming a
laminated insulating film of MNOS structure, a silicon nitride
film of 4 to 10 nm thickness and a silicon oxide film of 2 to 5
nm thickness may be formed sequentially on the surface of
the polysilicon film by CVD. Alternatively, a silicon nitride 
film of 4 to 10 nm thickness is deposited on the surface of the
polysilicon film by CVD and the surface of the silicon nitride
film is oxidized to form a silicon oxide film of 2 to 5 nm
thickness. In order to form a laminated insulating film of
MONOS structure, a silicon oxide film of 2 to 5 nm thickness,
a silicon nitride film of 4 to 8 nm thickness and a silicon
oxide film of 2 to 5 nm thickness are deposited sequentially
on the surface of the polysilicon film by CVD. Alternatively,
a silicon oxide film of 2 to 5 nm thickness and a silicon

on the surface of the polysilicon film by CVD, and then the
surface of the silicon nitride film is oxidized to form a silicon

of the polysilicon film may be oxidized to form a silicon oxide

combined in any way.</p>
    <p num="1161">Then, the laminated insulating film 1620 formed on
the N-type semiconductor layer 1722-1 is selectively removed.
For example, the laminated insulating film 1620 is
anisotropically etched to remain in the form of a sidewall

    <p num="1162">In the same manner as the above, island-like
semiconductor layers 1722-2 to 1724-1, 1112 and 1113 are
buried in the first trench 1210. For example, from the
island-like semiconductor layer 1722-1 located at the bottom
of the first trench 1210, the semiconductor layers are formed
selectively by epitaxial growth. At this time, from the bottom, 
an N-type semiconductor layer 1722-2, a P-type

1723, a P-type semiconductor layer 1113 and an N-type

preferable that the N-type semiconductor layers 1722-2 and
1723 are overlapped with the polysilicon film 1512 (the first

semiconductor layers 1723 and 1724-1 are overlapped with
the polysilicon film 1513 (the first conductive film) with

respectively. Further, it is preferred that the N-type
semiconductor layer 1724-1 is formed such that it is not
overlapped with the polysilicon film 1514 (the first conductive

    <p num="1163">Then, using the N-type semiconductor layer 1724-1
as a mask, the laminated insulating film 1620 is partially
removed. A silicon oxide film 1444 is formed as a third
insulating film to be a gate oxide film to a thickness of about
10 nm by CVD on the inner wall of the first trench 1210.
The silicon oxide film 1444, however, may be formed of not
only a CVD oxide film but also a thermally oxidized film or a
nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="1164">Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 1444 formed on

    <p num="1165">Thereafter, the silicon oxide film 1444 is subjected to
thermal treatment or the like. Further, in the same manner
as the above, island-like semiconductor layers 1724-2, 1725

from the island-like semiconductor layer 1724-1 located at
the bottom of the first trench 1210, the semiconductor layers
are formed selectively by epitaxial growth. At this time, from
the bottom, an N-type semiconductor layer 1724-2, a P-type

semiconductor layer 1725 is reduced by etch-back or CMP,
for example, to expose the silicon oxide film 1425 (the fifth
insulating film). Thereby the N-type semiconductor layer
1725 is separated. Then, a fourth wiring layer is formed so
that its direction crosses the direction of the second or third 
wiring layer and is connected to the top portion of the N-type
semiconductor layer 1725.</p>
    <p num="1166">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed. Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized
which has a memory function according to the state of a

insulating film.</p>
    <p num="1167">In this example, the silicon nitride film (the second

polysilicon films 1511 to 1514 (the first conductive films) and
the polysilicon films 1522 and 1523 (the second conductive

after the formation of the polysilicon films or after the
formation of the sidewall spacer. The timing of the impurity
introduction to the polysilicon films is not particularly limited
so long as these films become conductive films.</p>
    <p num="1168">In this example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a

    <p num="1206">In this example, a silicon oxide film 1410, for
example; is deposited as a first insulating film to be an
injection protective film to a thickness of 2 to 20 nm on a
surface of a p-type silicon substrate 1100, and a first
impurity layer 1710 is formed on the p-type silicon substrate
1100 by ion implantation (Figs. 1395 and 1416). For
example, the ion implantation may be performed at
implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at an arsenic dose of
about 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> in a direction inclined by about
0 to 7° with respect to the normal line of the surface of the
substrate. Alternatively, instead of the channel ion
implantation, an oxide film containing arsenic may be
deposited by CVD with a view to utilizing diffusion of arsenic
from the oxide film. The first impurity layer 1710 may not
be formed on the topmost surface of the p-type silicon
substrate 1100.</p>
    <p num="1207">Using a resist film R5 patterned by a known
photolithographic technique as a mask, the first insulating
film 1410 and the P-type silicon substrate 1100 are etched by
200 to 2,000 nm by reactive ion etching so that the first
impurity layer 1710 is separated, thereby forming a second
trench 1220 (Figs. 1396 and 1417).</p>
    <p num="1208">After the resist film R5 is removed, a silicon oxide
film 1420, for example, is deposited as a fifth insulating film
to a thickness of 100 to 300 nm and buried in the second
trench 1220 by etch-back (Figs. 1397 and 1418). The silicon 
oxide film 1420 may be buried by isotropic or anisotropic
etch-back, CMP, or a combination in various ways. At this
time, the silicon oxide film 1420 may be a silicon nitride film.
The silicon oxide film 1410 may be removed or may remain.
For example, if the silicon oxide film 1410 is removed, a
silicon nitride film 1310, for example, is formed as a second
insulating film to a thickness of 1,000 to 10,000 nm on the
p-type silicon substrate 1100 or the first impurity layer 1710
(Figs. 1398 and 1419).</p>
    <p num="1209">Subsequently, using a resist film R6 patterned by a
known photolithographic technique as a mask, the silicon
nitride film 1310 is etched by reactive ion etching, for
example, to form a fourth trench 1240 in a lattice form (Figs.
1399 and 1420).</p>
    <p num="1210">Then, a silicon oxide film 1421, for example, is
deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500
nm by CVD in the lattice-form fourth trench 1240.</p>
    <p num="1211">The silicon oxide film 1421 is buried in the fourth
trench 1240 to a desired depth, for example, by isotropic
etching (Figs. 1400 and 1421). Then, on the surface of the
silicon nitride film 1310, a silicon oxide film 1431, for
example, is deposited as a fourth insulating film to a
thickness of 1 to 10 nm and a polysilicon film 1511, for
example, is deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness
of about 50 to 200 nm (Figs. 1401 and 1422).</p>
    <p num="1212">In the same manner, the polysilicon film 1511 is
etched back in the form of a sidewall spacer of a desired
height (Figs. 1402 and 1422). At this time, the polysilicon
films 1511 (the first conductive films) are formed to surround 
the silicon nitride films 1310, respectively, and isolated from
each other.</p>
    <p num="1213">Subsequently, an interlayer insulating film 1611 is
formed on the surface of the polysilicon film 1511 (Fig. 1403
and Fig. 1424). This interlayer insulating film 1611 may be
formed of an ONO film. The ONO film may be formed in the
same manner as in Production example 1.</p>
    <p num="1214">Then, in the same manner, a polysilicon film 1521,
for example, is deposited as a second conductive film to a
thickness of 15 to 150 nm (Figs. 1404 and 1425) and etched
back to a depth corresponding to the deposit thickness,
thereby the interlayer insulating film 1611 on the silicon
oxide film 1421 is exposed and the polysilicon film 1521 is
disposed on the side of the polysilicon film 1511 (the first
conductive film) with intervention of the interlayer insulating
film 1611. At this time, a polysilicon film 1525 (a second
conductive film) remains around the silicon nitride film 1310.
It is preferable that the polysilicon film 1521 and the
polysilicon film 1525 are separated (Figs. 1405 and 1426).
At this time, by setting the intervals between the fourth
trenches 1240 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 5 to a
predetermined value or smaller, the polysilicon film 1521 is
formed into a third wiring layer to be a control gate line
continuous in the direction without need to use a masking
process.</p>
    <p num="1215">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 1422, for example, is
deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500
nm.</p>
    <p num="1216">Then, a silicon oxide film 1422, for example, is 
buried as a fifth insulating film in the fourth trench 1240 to a
desired depth by isotropic etching (Figs. 1406 and 1427).
Using the silicon oxide film 1422 as a mask, the exposed
polysilicon film 1525 is removed by isotropic etching (Figs.
1407 and 1428). At this time, the etching is performed in an
etching amount corresponding to the thickness of the
polysilicon film 1525. Thereby, variations in the production
process can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="1217">Subsequently, the polysilicon film 1525 remaining
between the silicon nitride film 1310 and the silicon oxide
film 1422 is removed by isotropic or anisotropic etching (Figs.
1408 and 1429).</p>
    <p num="1218">Then, a silicon oxide film 1482, for example, is
deposited as a sixth insulating film to a thickness of 8 to 80
nm such that it is buried in a space between the silicon
nitride film 1310 and the silicon oxide film 1422. At this
time, it is preferred that the thickness of the silicon oxide film
1482 is about half or more of the thickness of the polysilicon
film 1521 (Figs. 1409 and 1430).</p>
    <p num="1219">Then, isotropic etching is performed to a depth
corresponding to the deposit thickness of the silicon oxide
film 1482, thereby the interlayer insulating film 1611 present
on the side of the silicon nitride film 1310 is exposed and the
silicon oxide film 1482 is buried in the fourth trench 1240
(Figs. 1410 and 1431). Here, explanation is given of the
formation of the polysilicon film 1521 as the second
conductive film. However, the polysilicon film 1521 may be
formed into the form of a sidewall spacer merely by a
combination of deposition and anisotropic etching. </p>
    <p num="1220">Thereafter, using the silicon oxide film 1422 as a
mask, the interlayer insulating film 1611 is partially removed
by isotropic etching, for example (Figs. 1411 and 1423).</p>
    <p num="1221">By repeating likewise, a polysilicon film 1522 is
disposed as a second conductive film on the side of a
polysilicon film 1512 with intervention of an interlayer
insulating film 1612, and then the polysilicon film 1522 is
buried by forming thereon a silicon oxide film 1423 (a fifth
insulating film) and a silicon oxide film 1483 (a sixth
insulating film).</p>
    <p num="1222">The top of the silicon nitride film 1310 is exposed by
etch-back or by CMP (Figs. 1412 and 1433). At this time,
the silicon oxide film 1423 may be a silicon nitride film.</p>
    <p num="1223">The silicon nitride film 1310 is selectively removed by
isotropic etching to form a first trench 1210.</p>
    <p num="1224">Then, a silicon oxide film 1440 is formed as a third
insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film to a thickness of
about 10 nm by CVD on the inner wall of the first trench
1210 (Figs. 1413 and 1434). The silicon oxide film 1440,
however, may be formed of not only a CVD oxide film but also
a thermally oxidized film or a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="1225">Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 1440 formed on
the first impurity diffusion layer 1710 or the p-type silicon
substrate 1100 is selectively removed. For example, the
silicon oxide film 1440 is anisotropically etched to remain in
the form of a sidewall spacer only on the sidewall of the first
trench 1210.</p>
    <p num="1226">The silicon oxide film 1440 is subjected to thermal
treatment or the like in the same manner as in Production 
example 69.</p>
    <p num="1227">Then, if required, an oxide film generated on the
surface of the first impurity diffusion layer 1710 or the p-type
silicon substrate 1100 is optionally removed by using diluted
HF, for example, and island-like semiconductor layers 1721 to
1723, 1111 and 1112 are buried in the first trench 1210.
For example, from the first impurity diffusion layer 1710 or
the p-type silicon substrate 1100 located at the bottom of the
first trench 1210, the semiconductor layers are formed
selectively by epitaxial growth. At this time, from the bottom,
an N-type semiconductor layer 1721, a P-type semiconductor
layer 1111, an N-type semiconductor layer 1722, a P-type
semiconductor layer 1112 and an N-type semiconductor layer
1723 are sequentially formed (Figs. 1414 and 1435). The
N-type semiconductor layers 1721 to 1723 are formed at an
arsenic concentration of about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> and the
P-type semiconductor layers 1111 and 1112 are formed at a
boron concentration of about 1 × 10<sup>15</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. It is
preferable that the N-type semiconductor layers 1721 and
1722 are overlapped with the polysilicon film 1511 (the first
conductive film) with intervention of the silicon oxide film
1440 (the third insulating film), respectively. It is also
preferred that the N-type semiconductor layers 1722 and
1723 are overlapped with the polysilicon film 1512 (the first
conductive film) with intervention of the silicon oxide film
1440 (the third insulating film), respectively.</p>
    <p num="1228">Thereafter, the N-type semiconductor layer 1723 is
reduced by etch-back or CMP, for example, to expose the
silicon oxide film 1423 (the fifth insulating film). Thereby 
the N-type semiconductor layer 1723 is separated.</p>
    <p num="1229">Then, a fourth wiring layer is formed so that its
direction crosses the direction of the second or third wiring
layer and is connected to the top portion of the N-type
semiconductor layer 1723.</p>
    <p num="1230">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed. Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized
which has a memory function according to the state of a
charge in the charge storage layer which is the floating gate
made of the polysilicon film (the first conductive film) (Figs.
1415 and 1436).</p>
    <p num="1231">In this example, films formed on the surface of the
semiconductor substrate or the polysilicon film such as the
silicon nitride film (the second insulating film) 1310 may be
formed of a layered film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon

polysilicon films 1511 and 1512 (the first conductive films)
and the polysilicon films 1521 and 1522 (the second
conductive films), impurity introduction may be carried out
during or after the formation of the polysilicon films or after
the formation of the sidewall spacer. The timing of the
impurity introduction to the polysilicon films is not
particularly limited so long as these films become conductive
films.</p>
    <p num="1232">In this example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a
mask. However, that is possible only where the island-like
semiconductor layers are not disposed symmetrically to a 
diagonal. In contrast, if the island-like semiconductor layers
are disposed symmetrically to a diagonal, for example, the
wiring layers may be separated through patterning with use of
resist films by photolithography.</p>

    <p num="1233">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this

    <p num="1261">The silicon oxide film 1423 is buried in the fourth
trench 1240 to a desired depth, for example, by isotropic
etching (Figs. 1474 and 1478). Using the silicon oxide film
1423 as a mask, the exposed polysilicon film 1522 is removed
by isotropic or anisotropic etching (Figs. 1475 and 1479). At
this time, the etching is performed in an etching amount
corresponding to the thickness of the polysilicon film 1522.
Thereby, variations in the production process can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="1262">Subsequently, the polysilicon film 1522 is arranged
such that it remains between the silicon nitride film 1310 and
the silicon oxide film 1423 (Figs. 1476 and 1480). Thereby,
an area increases in which the polysilicon film 1512 contacts
the polysilicon film 1522 with intervention of the interlayer
insulating film 1612, which improves the coupling ratio.</p>

    <heading>Production Example 90</heading>
    <p num="1292">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this
example, a semiconductor substrate is patterned in the form
of pillars to form island-like semiconductor layers. Sides of
the island-like semiconductor layers make active regions. A
plurality of tunnel oxide films and floating gates as charge
storage layers are formed on the active regions. The
island-like semiconductor layers are each in an electrically
floating state with respect to the semiconductor substrate.
The active region of each memory cell is in the electrically
floating state. Selection gate transistors are disposed at the
top and the bottom of the island-like semiconductor layer. A
plurality of memory transistors, for example, two memory
transistors, are placed between the selection gate transistors
and are connected in series along the island-like
semiconductor layer. The thickness of gate insulating films 
of the selection gate transistors is larger than the thickness
of gate insulating films of the memory transistors. The
transistors are formed from the bottom to the top.</p>
    <p num="1293">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by
the following process. Figs. 1531 to 1540 and Figs. 1541 to
1550 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line B-B',
respectively, in Fig. 1 illustrating a memory cell array of an
EEPROM.</p>
    <p num="1294">First, a silicon nitride film 310, for example, is
deposited to a thickness of 200 to 2,000 nm as a first
insulating film to be a mask layer on a surface of a P-type
silicon substrate 100. Using a resist film P11 patterned by a
known photolithographic technique as a mask (Fig. 1531 and
Fig. 1541), the silicon nitride film 310 is etched by reactive
ion etching.</p>
    <p num="1295">The P-type silicon substrate 100 is etched to a depth
of about 2,000 to 20,000 nm by reactive ion etching using the
silicon nitride film 310 as a mask to form a first trench 210 in
a lattice form. Thereby the P-type silicon substrate 100 is
separated into a plurality of island-like pillar-form
semiconductor layers 110.</p>
    <p num="1296">The surface of the island-like semiconductor layer
110 is oxidized to form a second insulating film, for example,
a thermally oxidized film 410, to a thickness of 10 nm to 100
nm (Figs. 1532 and 1542). At this time, if the island-like
semiconductor layer 110 has been formed in the minimum
photoetching dimension, the dimension of the island-like
semiconductor layer 110 is decreased by the formation of the
thermally oxidized film 410, that is, the island-like 
semiconductor layer 110 is formed to have a dimension not
larger than the minimum photoetching dimension.</p>
    <p num="1297">Next, the thermally oxidized film 410 is etched away
from the periphery of each island-like semiconductor layer
110, for example, by isotropic etching (Figs. 1533 and 1543).
Then, as required, channel ion implantation is carried out
into the sidewall of the island semiconductor layers 110 by
slant ion implantation. For example, the ion implantation
may be performed at an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV
at a boron dose of about 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> at an
angle of 5 to 45° with respect to the normal line of the
surface of the substrate. Preferably the channel ion
implantation is performed from various directions to the
island-like semiconductor layers 110 because a surface
impurity concentration becomes more uniform. Alternatively,
instead of the channel ion implantation, an oxide film
containing boron may be deposited by CVD with a view to
utilizing diffusion of boron from the oxide film. The impurity
implantation from the surface of the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 may be carried out before the
island-like semiconductor layers 110 are covered with the
thermally oxidized film 410, or the impurity implantation may
be finished before the island-like semiconductor layers 110
are formed. Means for the implantation are not particularly
limited so long as an impurity concentration distribution is
almost equal over the island-like semiconductor layers 110.</p>
    <p num="1298">Subsequently, a silicon oxide film 431, for example,
is deposited as a fifth insulating film in the lattice-form first
trench 210 to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm by CVD and etched 
back to a desired depth so that the silicon oxide film 431 is
buried in the first trench 210. The deposition and the
etch-back of the silicon oxide film 431 may be carried out
without removing the thermally oxidized film 410 by etching.</p>
    <p num="1299">Then, a silicon oxide film 481, for example, is formed
as a thirteenth insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film to a
thickness of about 10 nm around each island-like
semiconductor layer 110, for example, by CVD. The tunnel
oxide film, however, may be formed of not only a CVD oxide
film but also a thermally oxidized film or a nitrogen oxide
film.</p>
    <p num="1300">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 511, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50
to 200 nm. The polysilicon film 511 is then etched by
reactive ion etching, for example, to remain in the form of a
sidewall spacer of a desired height (Figs. 1534 and 1544).</p>
    <p num="1301">Then, a silicon oxide film 432, for example, is
deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500
nm by CVD. The silicon oxide film 432 is then etched back
by isotropic etching, for example, such that the polysilicon
film 511 remaining in the form of the sidewall spacer is
completely buried.</p>
    <p num="1302">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 422, for example, is
formed as a third insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film to a
thickness of about 10 nm, for example, by thermal oxidation.
The silicon oxide film 422, similar to the silicon oxide film
481 (the thirteenth insulating film), may be formed of not only
a thermally oxidized film but also a CVD oxide film or a
nitrogen oxide film. The silicon oxide film 422 may not be 
formed of the same material as that of the silicon oxide film
481. The silicon oxide films 422 and 481 may be formed to
have an optionally determined thickness, and the thickness of
the silicon oxide film 422 may be smaller or larger than or
equal to the thickness of the silicon oxide film 481.</p>
    <p num="1303">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 512, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50
to 200 nm. The polysilicon film 512 is then etched by
reactive ion etching, for example, to remain in the form of a
sidewall spacer of a desired height (Figs. 1535 and 1545).
By repeating likewise, a silicon oxide film 433 (a fifth
insulating film) is embedded such that the polysilicon film
512 is buried, a silicon oxide film 423 is formed as a third
insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film to a thickness of
about 10 nm around each island-like semiconductor layer 110,
and then a polysilicon film 513 is disposed as a first
conductive film on the side of the silicon oxide film 423. In
the same manner, a silicon oxide film 434 (a fifth insulating
film) is embedded such that the polysilicon film 513 is buried,
a silicon oxide film 484 is formed as a thirteenth insulating
film to be a tunnel oxide film to a thickness of about 10 nm
around each island-like semiconductor layer 110, and then a
polysilicon film 514 is disposed as a first conductive film on
the side of the silicon oxide film 484 (Figs. 1536 and 1546).</p>
    <p num="1304">Next, the silicon oxide films 434, 433, 432 and 431
(the fifth insulating films) are removed by isotropic etching,
and then impurity introduction is carried out into the
island-like semiconductor layers 110 and the semiconductor
substrate 100 in self-alignment with the polysilicon films 511 
to 514, which are separated first conductive films, and the
silicon nitride film 310. For example, N-type impurity
diffusion layers 710 to 724 are formed in an arsenic
concentration of about 1 × 10<sup>18</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> by, for
example, solid or vapor phase diffusion process. At this time,
the impurity diffusion layer 710 to be a first wiring layer may
be adjusted about its impurity concentration by ion
implantation (Fig. 1537 and Fig. 1547). For example, the ion
implantation may be performed at an implantation energy of 5
to 100 keV at a phosphorus dose of about 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> to 1 ×
10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> in a direction inclined by about 0 to 7° .
Thereafter, thermal treatment is carried out to form the
impurity diffusion layers 710 to 724, thereby bringing P-type
regions of the island-like semiconductor layers 110 to an
electrically floating state (Figs. 1538 and 1548). Preferably
the impurity concentration distribution in the impurity
diffusion layer 710 to be a first wiring layer keeps a gentle
gradient towards the P-type silicon substrate 110. The
impurity introduction to the polysilicon films 511 to 514 may
be performed during the formation of the polysilicon film 510
or during the impurity introduction into the island-like
semiconductor layers 110. The timing of the impurity
introduction is not particularly limited so long as these films
become conductive films.</p>
    <p num="1305">Then, a silicon oxide film 471, for example, is
deposited as an eleventh insulating film to a thickness of 50
to 500 nm by CVD and embedded by anisotropic or isotropic
etching to bury the side of the polysilicon film 511.</p>
    <p num="1306">Then, a silicon nitride film 340, for example, is 
deposited as a twelfth insulating film to a thickness of 5 to 50
nm to form a sidewall spacer (Figs. 1539 and 1549).</p>
    <p num="1307">Subsequently, the silicon oxide film 471 is etched
back to such a degree that the side of the polysilicon film 511
is exposed, and a polysilicon film 521, for example, is
deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness of 15 to
150 nm.</p>
    <p num="1308">Then, the polysilicon film 521 is etched back, and
the silicon oxide film 471 and the P-type silicon substrate 100
are etched by anisotropic etching, for example, to form a
second trench 220 in self-alignment with the polysilicon film
521, thereby separating the impurity diffusion layer 710.
That is, a separation portion of the first wiring layer is formed
in self-alignment with a separation portion of the second
conductive film.</p>
    <p num="1309">Subsequently, the polysilicon film 521 is etched back
to such a degree that the polysilicon film 521 is able to
contact the polysilicon film 511 to form a selection gate. At
this time, by setting the intervals between the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a
predetermined value or smaller, the polysilicon film 521 is
formed into a second wiring layer to be a selection gate line
continuous in the direction without need to use a masking
process.</p>
    <p num="1310">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 462, for example, is
deposited as an eighth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm by CVD and anisotropically or isotropically etched so
that the silicon oxide film 462 is embedded at least to bury
the polysilicon film (the second conductive film) 521. Then 
the sidewall spacer of the silicon nitride film (the twelfth
insulating film) 340 is removed by isotropic etching and an
interlayer insulating film 612 is formed on exposed surfaces
of the polysilicon films 512 to 514. This interlayer
insulating film 612 may be formed of an ONO film, for
example. The ONO film can be formed in the same manner
as Production example 1.</p>
    <p num="1311">Subsequently, in the same manner, a polysilicon film
522 is deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness of
15 to 150 nm and etched back so that the polysilicon film 522
is disposed on the side of the polysilicon film (the first
conductive film) 512 with intervention of the interlayer
insulating film 612. At this time, by setting the intervals
between the island-like semiconductor layers 110 in the
direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined value or smaller,
the polysilicon film 522 is formed into a third wiring layer to
be a control gate line continuous in the direction of A-A'
without need to use a masking process.</p>
    <p num="1312">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 463, for example, is
deposited as an eighth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm by CVD and anisotropically or isotropically etched so
that the silicon oxide film 463 is embedded at least to bury
the polysilicon film (the second conductive film) 522. By
repeating likewise, a polysilicon film (a second conductive
film) 523 is disposed on the side of the polysilicon film (the
first conductive film) 513 with intervention of an interlayer
insulating film 613. With regard to the polysilicon film 514
which is the topmost first conductive film, a polysilicon film
(a second conductive film) 524 is etched back to such a 
degree that the polysilicon film 524 is able to contact the
polysilicon film (the first conductive film) 514, in the same
manner as the polysilicon film 511 which is the bottommost
first conductive film. A silicon oxide film 465, for example,
is deposited as a tenth insulating film to a thickness of 100 to
500 nm on the top of the polysilicon film 524. The top
portion of the island-like semiconductor layer 110 provided
with the impurity diffusion layer 724 is exposed by etch-back
or by CMP. A fourth wiring layer is then formed so that its
direction crosses the direction of the second or third wiring
layer and is connected to the top portion of the island-like
semiconductor layer 110.</p>
    <p num="1313">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed (Figs. 1540 and 1550).</p>
    <p num="1314">Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized which
has a memory function according to the state of a charge in
the charge storage layer which is the floating gate made of the
polysilicon film (the first conductive film).</p>
    <p num="1315">By bringing an active region of each memory cell into
a floating state with respect to the semiconductor substrate,
the back-bias effect from the substrate is eliminated and
variations in threshold between the memory cells located at

    <p num="1316">In this example, the side of the island-like
semiconductor layer 110, which makes an active region, is
oxidized and the oxide film 410 is removed to form the
pillar-form island-like semiconductor layer 110 having a 
dimension smaller than the minimum photoetching dimension.
This allows increase in the ratio of the capacity between the
floating gates and the control gates to the capacity between
the floating gates and the pillar-form semiconductor layers
without increasing the area occupied by the memory cells.
Thereby, data writing and erasing in and from the memory
cells can be carried out without difficulty.</p>
    <p num="1317">Further, by providing the selection gates in the top
and the bottom of a set of memory cells, it is possible to
prevent the phenomenon that a memory cell transistor is
over-erased.</p>
    <p num="1318">In this example, films formed on the surface of the
semiconductor substrate or the polysilicon film such as the
silicon nitride film 310 and the silicon nitride film 340 may be
formed of a layered film of a silicon oxide film / a silicon

    <p num="1319">The insulating films used in the present invention
are not limited to an oxide film and a nitride film. Similar to
the insulating film to be buried in the second trench 220, the

    <p num="1320">In this example, the control gates of the memory cells
are formed continuously in one direction without using a

semiconductor layers are not disposed symmetrically to a
diagonal. In contrast, if the island-like semiconductor layers
are disposed symmetrically to a diagonal, for example, the
wiring layers may be separated through patterning with use of
resist films by photolithography. </p>
    <heading>Production Example 91</heading>
    <p num="1321">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this
example, a semiconductor substrate is patterned in the form
of pillars to form island-like semiconductor layers. Sides of
the island-like semiconductor layers make active regions. A
plurality of tunnel oxide films and floating gates as charge
storage layers are formed on the active regions. The
island-like semiconductor layers are each in an electrically
floating state with respect to the semiconductor substrate.
The active region of each memory cell is in the electrically
floating state. The active regions of the memory cells are
electrically common. Selection gate transistors are disposed
at the top and the bottom of the island-like semiconductor
layer. A plurality of memory transistors, for example, two
memory transistors, are placed between the selection gate
transistors and are connected in series along the island-like
semiconductor layer. The thickness of gate insulating films
of the selection gate transistors is larger than the thickness
of gate insulating films of the memory transistors. The
transistors are formed from the bottom to the top.</p>
    <p num="1322">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by
the following process. Figs. 1551 to 1564 and Figs. 1565 to
1578 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line B-B',
respectively, in Fig. 1 illustrating a memory cell array of an
EEPROM.</p>
    <p num="1323">First, a silicon nitride film 310, for example, is
deposited to a thickness of 200 to 2,000 nm as a first
insulating film to be a mask layer on a surface of a P-type
silicon substrate 100. Using a resist film R11 patterned by a 
known photolithographic technique as a mask, the silicon
nitride film 310 is etched by reactive ion etching. The P-type
silicon substrate 100 is then etched to a depth of about 100
to 5,000 nm by reactive ion etching to form a first trench 210
in a lattice form in a direction of B-B' (Figs. 1551 and 1565).
At the etching of the P-type silicon substrate 100, the resist
film R11 may be removed and the silicon nitride film 310 may
be used as a mask.</p>
    <p num="1324">Then, using a resist film R12 patterned by a known
photolithographic technique as a mask, the silicon nitride
film 310 is etched by reactive ion etching to form a trench
211 in a lattice form in a direction of A-A' (Figs. 1552 and
1566).</p>
    <p num="1325">The P-type silicon substrate 100 is etched by reactive
ion etching to a depth of about 2,000 to 20,000 nm to form a
trench 212 in a lattice form (Figs. 1553 and 1567). Thereby
the P-type silicon substrate 100 is separated into a plurality
of island-like pillar-form semiconductor layers 110. At this
time, the lattice-form trench 212 in the direction of B-B' is
formed to have a larger depth than that of the trench 212 in
the direction of A-A'.</p>
    <p num="1326">Subsequently, in the same manner as Production
example 90, channel ion implantation is carried out into the
sidewall of the island semiconductor layers 110. Means and
timing for the implantation are not particularly limited as in
the same manner as Production example 90.</p>
    <p num="1327">The surface of the island-like semiconductor layer
110 is oxidized to form a second insulating film, for example,
a thermally oxidized film 410, to a thickness of 10 nm to 100 
nm. If the island-like semiconductor layer 110 has been
formed in the minimum photoetching dimension, the
dimension of the island-like semiconductor layer 110 is
decreased by the formation of the thermally oxidized film 410,
that is, the island-like semiconductor layer 110 is formed to
have a dimension not larger than the minimum photoetching
dimension. Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 431, for example,
is deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm by CVD in the lattice-form trench 212. The silicon
oxide film 431 is buried in the lattice-form trench 212 in the
direction of B-B' to a depth equal to or lower than the bottom
of the lattice-form trench 212 in the direction of A-A', and
then impurity introduction is carried out into the bottom of
the separation portions between the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 (Figs. 1554 and 1568). For
example, ion implantation may be performed at an
implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at an arsenic dose of
about 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> in a direction inclined by
about 0 to 7° . Then, thermal treatment is carried out to
diffuse impurities that have been introduced in advance to
form an impurity diffusion layer 710. The impurity diffusion
layer 710 does not require any additional separation process
and is ready to be formed as a first wiring layer.</p>
    <p num="1328">Then, a silicon oxide film 481, for example, is formed
as a thirteenth insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film to a
thickness of about 10 nm around each island-like
semiconductor layer 110, for example, by thermal oxidation
(Figs. 1555 and 1569). The tunnel oxide film, however, may
be formed of not only a thermally oxidized film but also a CVD 
oxide film or a nitrogen oxide film.</p>
    <p num="1329">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 511, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50
to 200 nm. The polysilicon film 511 is then etched by
reactive ion etching, for example, to remain in the form of a
sidewall spacer of a desired height (Figs. 1556 and 1570). At
this time, by setting the intervals between the island-like
semiconductor layers 110 in a direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a
predetermined value or smaller, the polysilicon film 511 is
formed into a second wiring layer to be a selection gate line
continuous in the direction without need to use a masking
process.</p>
    <p num="1330">Then, a silicon oxide film 451, for example, is
deposited as a seventh insulating film to a thickness of about
10 to 30 nm around each island-like semiconductor layer 110
and the polysilicon film 511, for example, by thermal
oxidation. Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 432, for example,
is deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm by CVD (Figs. 1557 and 1571) and embedded such
that the polysilicon film 511 remaining in the form of the
sidewall spacer is completely buried (Figs. 1558 and 1572).
At this time, the thickness of the silicon oxide film 432 is set
to be 20 to 30 nm or smaller on the top portion of the
polysilicon film 511.</p>
    <p num="1331">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 422, for example, is
formed as a third insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film to a
thickness of about 10 nm, for example, by thermal oxidation.
The silicon oxide film 422, similar to the silicon oxide film
481 (the thirteenth insulating film), may be formed of not only 
a thermally oxidized film but also a CVD oxide film or a
nitrogen oxide film. The silicon oxide film 422 may not be
formed of the same material as that of the silicon oxide film
481. The silicon oxide films 422 and 481 may be formed to
have an optionally determined thickness, and the thickness of
the silicon oxide film 422 may be smaller or larger than or
equal to the thickness of the silicon oxide film 481. The
silicon oxide film 451 may not necessarily be formed.
However, in that case, the thickness of the silicon oxide film
(the third insulating film) 422 might possibly be uneven at a
portion contacting the silicon nitride film (the fourth
insulating film) 432. Therefore it is preferred to form the
silicon oxide film 451 in advance.</p>
    <p num="1332">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 512, for example, is
deposited as a first conductive film to a thickness of about 50
to 200 nm. The polysilicon film 512 is then etched by
reactive ion etching, for example, to remain in the form of a
sidewall spacer of a desired height.</p>
    <p num="1333">Then, an interlayer insulating film 612 is formed
(Figs. 1559 and 1573). This interlayer insulating film 612
may be formed of an ONO film, for example. The ONO film
may be formed in the same manner as described in
Production example 1.</p>
    <p num="1334">Subsequently, a polysilicon film 522, for example, is
deposited as a second conductive film to a thickness of 15 to
150 nm and etched back so that the polysilicon film 522 is
disposed on the side of the polysilicon film (the first
conductive film) 512 with intervention of the interlayer
insulating film 612 (Figs. 1560 and 1574). At this time, by 
setting the intervals between the island-like semiconductor
layers 110 in the direction of A-A' in Fig. 1 to a predetermined
value or smaller, the polysilicon film 522 is formed into a
third wiring layer to be a control gate line continuous in the
direction of A-A' without need to use a masking process.</p>
    <p num="1335">Then, a silicon oxide film 452, for example, is
deposited as a seventh insulating film to a thickness of about
10 to 30 nm around each island-like semiconductor layer 110
and the polysilicon film 522, for example, by thermal
oxidation. Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 433, for example,
is deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm by CVD (Figs. 1561 and 1575). By repeating likewise,
a position within 20 to 30 nm or smaller above the third
wiring layer, a silicon oxide film 423 is formed as a third
insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film on the surface of the
island-like semiconductor layer 110. A polysilicon film 513
is disposed as a first conductive film on the side of the silicon
oxide film 423 and a polysilicon film 523 is disposed as a
second conductive film on the side of the polysilicon film 513
with intervention of an interlayer insulating film 613.</p>
    <p num="1336">Then, a silicon oxide film 453, for example, is
deposited as a seventh insulating film to a thickness of about
10 to 30 nm around each island-like semiconductor layer 110
and the polysilicon film 523, for example, by thermal
oxidation. Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 434, for example,
is deposited as a fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to
500 nm by CVD (Figs. 1562 and 1576) and etched back. At
this time, the thickness of the silicon oxide film 434 is set to
be 20 to 30 nm or smaller on the top portion of the polysilicon 
film 523.</p>
    <p num="1337">Thereafter, a silicon oxide film 484 is formed as a
thirteenth insulating film to be a tunnel oxide film on the
surface of the island-like semiconductor layer 110. A
polysilicon film 514 (a first conductive film) is formed on the
side of the silicon oxide film 484. On the polysilicon film
514, a silicon oxide film 435, for example, is deposited as a
fifth insulating film to a thickness of 50 to 500 nm by CVD
(Figs. 1563 and 1577). The top portion of the island-like
semiconductor layer 110 is exposed by etch-back or CMP and
impurities are introduced therein. Thermal treatment is
carried out to form an impurity diffusion layer 724. The
impurity introduction may be realized by doping arsenic by
ion implantation, or an oxide film containing arsenic may be
deposited by CVD with a view to utilizing diffusion of arsenic
from the oxide film.</p>
    <p num="1338">Then, a fourth wiring layer is formed so that its
direction crosses the direction of the second or third wiring
layer and is connected to the top portion of the island-like
semiconductor layer 110 (Figs. 1564 and 1578).</p>
    <p num="1339">Thereafter, by known techniques, an interlayer
insulating film is formed, and a contact hole and metal wiring
are formed.</p>
    <p num="1340">The same effect as obtained by Production Example
90 can be obtained in this example. According to this
example, the number of production steps is decreased, the
necessary height of the island-like semiconductor layers can
be reduced and variations in the production process can be
reduced. Thereby, a semiconductor memory is realized 
which has a memory function according to the state of a
charge in the charge storage layer which is the floating gate
made of the polysilicon film (the first conductive film).</p>
    <p num="1341">By bringing an active region of each memory cell into

    <p num="1342">In this example, the side of the island-like

    <p num="1347">The silicon oxide films 452 and 453 (the seventh
insulating films) may not be formed for the same reason
mentioned above with respect to the silicon oxide film 451.
However, it is preferred to form the silicon oxide films 452
and 453 with a view to improving uniformity in thickness of
the silicon oxide films 423 and 484.</p>
    <p num="1348">In this example, memory cells or control gates are
formed stage by stage, i.e., until a memory cell or a control
gate at a certain stage is completed, a memory cell or a
control gate at a stage thereabove is not formed. However, in
the same manner as in Production example 90, the tunnel
oxide films and the floating gates of every stage may be
formed in advance and then a second wiring layer or an
interlayer insulating film and a third wiring layer may be
formed stage by stage. More particularly, this example is the
same as Production example 90 except the step of forming the 
polysilicon films 511 to 514 (Figs. 1534 to 1536 and 1544 to
1546), in which the polysilicon films 511 to 514 are arranged
such that intervals therebetween are set to 20 to 30 nm or
smaller and the impurity diffusion layers 721, 722, 723 and
724 are not formed (Figs. 1537 and 1547).</p>
    <p num="1349">The first wiring layer may also be formed in the same
manner as in Production example 90, that is, a second trench
220 is formed in the P-type silicon substrate 110 in
self-alignment with a polysilicon film 521 (Fig. 1550) and then
a separation portion of the first wiring layer is formed.</p>
    <heading>Production example 92</heading>
    <p num="1350">In a semiconductor memory to be produced in this
example, a semiconductor substrate to which an oxide film is
inserted, for example, a semiconductor portion on an oxide
film of an SOI substrate, is patterned in the form of pillars to
form island-like semiconductor layers. Sides of the
island-like semiconductor layers make active regions. A
plurality of tunnel oxide films and floating gates as charge
storage layers are formed on the active regions. The
island-like semiconductor layers are each electrically common
to the semiconductor substrate. The active region of each
memory cell is in the electrically floating state. Selection
gate transistors are disposed at the top and the bottom of the
island-like semiconductor layer. A plurality of memory
transistors, for example, two memory transistors, are placed
between the selection gate transistors and are connected in
series along the island-like semiconductor layer. The
thickness of gate insulating films of the selection gate
transistors is larger than the thickness of gate insulating 
films of the memory transistors. The transistors are formed
from the bottom to the top.</p>
    <p num="1351">Such a semiconductor memory may be produced by
the following process. Figs. 1579 to 1585 and Figs. 1586 to
1592 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line B-B',

EEPROM.</p>
    <p num="1352">First, a silicon nitride film 310, for example, is
deposited to a thickness of 200 to 2,000 nm as a first
insulating film to be a mask layer on a surface of a SOI
substrate 101 which is used as a substrate. Using a resist
film P11 patterned by a known photolithographic technique
as a mask, the silicon nitride film 310 is etched by reactive
ion etching. The SOI substrate 101 is then etched to a depth
of about 10 to 5,000 nm by reactive ion etching to form a first
trench 210 in a lattice form in a direction of B-B' (Figs. 1579
and 1586). At the etching of the SOI substrate 101, the
resist film R11 may be removed and the silicon nitride film
310 may be used as a mask.</p>
    <p num="1353">Then, using a resist film R12 patterned by a known

the P-type silicon portion on the surface of the SOI substrate
101 is separated into a plurality of island-like pillar-form

    <p num="1356">The surface of the island-like semiconductor layer
110 is oxidized to form a second insulating film, for example,

formed in the minimum photoetching dimension, the
dimension of the island-like semiconductor layer 110 is
decreased by the formation of the thermally oxidized film 410,
that is, the island-like semiconductor layer 110 is formed to
have a dimension not larger than the minimum photoetching

the surface of the SOI substrate 101 remaining in the
separation portion extending in the direction of A-A' between
the island-like semiconductor layers 110 (Figs. 1582 and

an implantation energy of 5 to 100 keV at an arsenic dose of 
about 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> in a direction inclined by

diffuse impurities that have been introduced in advance to
form an impurity diffusion layer 710 (Figs. 1583 and 1590).
The impurity diffusion layer 710 does not require any

I2-I2', line I3-I3', line I4-I4', and line I5-I5', respectively, of
Fig. 8 illustrating a memory cell array of EEPROM. These
sectional views are taken at locations showing sites 921, 932,
933, 934 and 910 where terminals mounted on the top face of
the semiconductor device are electrically connected to the
wiring layers 521, 522, 523, 524 and 710 for the application
of voltage to the buried wiring layers from outside.</p>
    <p num="1430">The buried first, second and third wiring layers in a
region of a lead-out portion are arranged into steps as shown
in Figs. 1637 to 1642 and first, second and third contact
portions 921, 932, 933, 934 and 910 are opened to reach the
edges of the wiring layers, respectively, so that they do not
contact other wiring layers than the intended one. Then, a
silicon oxide film 492, for example, is deposited as a fifteenth
insulating film to a thickness of 10 to 100 nm and etched
back to a depth corresponding to the deposit thickness to
form a sidewall spacer on the inner wall of each contact
portion formed in the leading out portion. Thereafter, the
first, second and third wiring layers may be lead out to the
top face of the semiconductor memory by burying metal or a 
conductive film in the contact portions.</p>
    <p num="1431">Instead of forming the first, second and third contact
portions 921, 932, 933, 934 and 910, the conductive films
may be arranged such that they are lead out to the top face of
the semiconductor memory to obtain the same effect as the
above.</p>
    <p num="1432">Alternatively, the sidewall spacer of the silicon oxide
film 492 may not be formed in the inner wall of each contact
portion formed in the lead-out portion. In the case of
forming the sidewall spacer of the silicon oxide film 492 (the
fifteenth insulating film), the fifteenth insulating film may be
formed of not only a silicon oxide film but also a silicon
nitride film as long as it is an insulating film.</p>
    <p num="1433">For leading out the wiring layers, a common contact
portion may be formed in the region of the lead-out portion of
the memory cells continuous in a direction of A-A' as shown
in Figs. 1637 to 1642, or alternatively, the contact portions
may be formed in the lead out portions of the memory cells,
respectively.</p>
    <p num="1434">The lead-out of the first, second and third wiring
layers to the top face of the semiconductor by the
above-described process is applicable to all examples of the
present invention.</p>
    <heading>Production example 109</heading>
    <p num="1435">This example shows an example of production
process for producing a semiconductor memory in which the
transistors are formed from the bottom to the top after the
formation of the island-like semiconductor layers.
Explanation is given of a production process in which the 
polysilicon film covering the island-like semiconductor layer
110 has an altered shape. Figs. 1643 and 1644 and Figs.
1645 and 1646 are sectional views taken on line A-A' and line
B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1 illustrating a memory cell array of
an EEPROM.</p>
    <p num="1436">As shown in Figs. 1643 and 1645 and Figs. 1644 and
1646, the polysilicon film (the first conductive film) 510
covering the island-like semiconductor layer 110 may have a
shape such that it is uniformly deposited along the bottom
shape of the first trench 210. Alternatively, the polysilicon
film 510 may have a shape such that it is deposited partially
ununiformly according to the bottom shape of the first trench
210.</p>
    <heading>Production example 110</heading>
    <p num="1437">This example shows an example of production
process for producing a semiconductor memory in which the
transistors are formed from the bottom to the top after the
formation of the island-like semiconductor layer.

Explanation is given of a production process in which the
silicon nitride film 310 has an altered shape. Figs. 1647 and
1648 and Figs. 1649 and 1650 are sectional views taken on
line A-A' and line B-B', respectively, in Fig. 1 illustrating a
memory cell array of an EEPROM.</p>
    <p num="1438">According Production example 90 (Figs. 1531 and
1541), the mask layer 310 is etched by reactive ion etching
using a resist film R1 patterned by a known photolithographic
technique as a mask, and then the P-type semiconductor
substrate 100 is etched to a depth of 2,000 to 20,000 nm by
reactive ion etching by using the mask layer 310 as a mask to 
form a first trench 210. At this time, the mask layer 310
may be smaller (Figs. 1647 and 1649) or larger (Figs. 1648
and 1650) than the outward shape of the island-like
semiconductor layer 110. The shape of the mask layer 310
is not particularly limited.</p>
    <p num="1439">The above-described examples are formed may be
combined in any way.</p>
    <p num="1440">According to the present invention, it is possible to
avoid the back-bias effect of the substrate in the direction
vertical to the island semiconductor layer or prevent
variations of the back-bias effect, and it is also possible to
avoid increase of drive voltage. Thus a plurality of memory
cells can be formed which are connected in series between bit
lines and source lines. Thereby, it is possible to prevent
variations in the characteristics of the memory cells which
are caused by decline of the threshold in the memory cells at
reading, the decline resulting from the back-bias effect from
the substrate.</p>
    <p num="1441">In the case where the island-like semiconductor
layers are formed by epitaxial growth, it is possible to avoid
damage caused by etching process since the island-like
semiconductor layers can be formed without etching the
semiconductor layer.</p>
    <p num="1442">Further, in the case where semiconductor substrate
pillars provided with memory transistors are formed in the
minimum etching dimension and the smallest distance
between the semiconductor substrate pillars is the minimum
etching dimension, double the capacity of the prior-art 
memory device can be obtained if memory transistors in two
tiers are formed per semiconductor substrate pillar. That is,
the capacity of the device can be multiplied by the number of
tiers of transistors per semiconductor substrate pillar.
Generally, the larger the number of tiers, the more capacity
can be obtained. Thereby, the cell area per bit decreases,
the size of chips can be decreased and the production costs
can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="1443">Furthermore, since the vertical direction which
determines the device performance does not depend upon the
minimum etching dimension, the device performance can be
maintained.</p>
    <p num="1444">Further, since the memory cells are arranged to
surround the respective island-like semiconductor layers, the
drive current can be improved and the S value can be
increased.</p>
    <p num="1445">According to the production method for the
semiconductor memory device of the present invention, the
semiconductor substrate is patterned into the pillar form
using a circular pattern, and then the side of the
semiconductor substrate is sacrificially oxidized for
eliminating damage, defects and unevenness on the surface of
the substrate. Thus the surface of the substrate can be used
as good active regions. The diameter of the pillar can be
controlled by controlling the thickness of the oxide film
formed by this sacrificial oxidization, and therefore, it is
possible to easily increase the capacity between the floating
gate and the control gate. This capacity depends upon the
surface area of the tunnel oxide film and the surface area of 
the interlayer capacity film between the floating gate and the
control gate.</p>
    <p num="1446">Further, by using a circular pattern, it is possible to
avoid local concentration of the electric field in the active
region, and therefore, electric control can be easily done.
The arrangement of the gate electrodes around the pillar-form
semiconductor substrate improves the drive current and
increase the S value. The formation of impurity diffusion
layers such that the active regions of the memory cells are in
the floating state with respect to the substrate eliminates the
back-bias effect and variations in the characteristics of the
memory cells caused by the decline of the threshold of the
memory cells at reading.</p>
    <p num="1447">By forming a plurality of sidewalls of an insulating
film in the vertical direction on the sidewalls of floating gates
after the tunnel oxide films and the floating gates are
deposited, the floating gate can be patterned at the same time.
That is, the tunnel oxide films of the same nature can be
obtained with the respective memory cells. Or, by forming
the tunnel oxide film after the floating gates and the control
gates are formed, the tunnel oxide films of the same nature
can be obtained with the respective memory cells. The
region where the floating gates and the control gates are
formed is pre-defined by the thickness of the deposited films,
and then, the floating gates or the control gates are formed.
Therefore, it is possible to reduce patterning variations in the
gate length of the memory cell transistors to process
variations in the thickness of the deposited film. By using
these techniques, the variations in the characteristics of the 
memory cells are suppressed and the variations in the device
performance are suppressed. Thus the memory device can
be more easily controlled and produced at low costs.</p>
