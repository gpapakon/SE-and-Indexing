    <p>Microcellular polyurethane flexible foams suitable for use as
lightweight shoe sole components are produced by dissolving carbon dioxide into one
or both of the iso-side or resin-side of an isocyanate-prepolymer-based microcellular
polyurethane foam formulation. The resultant foams possess more uniform cell
structure and enhanced physical properties as compared to all water-blown foams of
the same basic formulation and density. The hardness of the foams is more suitable
for shoe sole, particularly midsole applications, than that of the water-blown foams,

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention pertains to low density, flexible microcellular
elastomers suitable, <i>inter alia,</i> for the preparation of molded shoe soles, inners, and
midsoles.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0002">Cushioned soles for footware, particularly athletic footware are
generally prepared from EVA (ethylenevinylacetate) microcellular foams. The
processing of such foams is not straightforward, and the foams themselves do not
have optimal properties. However, such foams continue to be used due to their
availability in the very low density range, i.e., 0.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup> to 0.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
    <p num="0003">Polyurethane polymers generally exhibit physical properties which are
superior to EVA polymers. However, numerous difficulties arise when attempts are
made to mold polyurethane microcellular foams at low densities. Due to the
hardness required for the end use, considerable amounts of low molecular weight
chain extenders are required. In prior microcellular foams which are water-blown,
the urea short segments which are created cause the formulations to have poor
processability, resulting in both shrinkage and splits in the parts. The physical
properties are also comprised, particularly when the superior properties of otherwise
similar noncellular polymers are considered. These problems have prevented use of
low density (&lt; 0.75 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) polyurethane microcellular foams, and more particularly,
very low density (&lt;0.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) polyurethane microcellular foams.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0004">It has been surprisingly discovered that low density, and particularly
very low density, polyurethane flexible microcellular elastomers may be prepared if 
the major portion of the water blowing agent is replaced by dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>.
Polyurethanes produced in this manner from ultra-low unsaturation polyols exhibit
mechanical properties, including relatively high hardness at low density, which
makes them eminently suitable for use in shoe sole components. Yet more
surprising, polyester polyol-based microcellular, flexible polyurethane elastomers
may be easily produced, even though their production as water-blown microcellular
foams was exceptionally difficult.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0005">FIGURE 1 illustrates the cell structure of a water-blown microcellular
foam.</p>
    <p num="0006">FIGURE 2 illustrates the more uniform cell structure achieved in
polyurethane microcellular foams when carbon dioxide is introduced into at least one
of the reactive components.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0007">The subject invention flexible microcellular foams have densities of
about 0.75 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or below. These microcellular foams are elastomeric, or "rubbery"
and should not be confused with microcellular rigid and semi-rigid foams produced
by the high pressure RIM (reaction injection molding) process and commonly used
for car parts such as fenders, bumpers, and fascias and the like. The microcellular
flexible foams should also not be confused with conventional cellular flexible
polyurethane foams. The latter have a coarse cell structure which is clearly visible
by inspection with the naked eye, whereas microcellular foams have exceptionally
small cells with an average cell size below 200 µm, and generally below 100 µm.
The microcellularity is often observable only as an added "texture" to the
microcellular polyurethane part unless microscopic means of examination are
employed. Unlike microcellular foams, conventional polyurethane foams are
routinely prepared at densities below 2 lb/ft<sup>3</sup> (0.17 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) due to their larger cell
size. </p>
    <p num="0008">Microcellular polyurethane foams are prepared by reaction of an
isocyanate component and an isocyanate-reactive component. In addition, various
surfactants, catalysts, stabilizers, pigments, fillers, etc., my be present. All the
foregoing ingredients are well known to those skilled in the art of flexible
microcellular polyurethane elastomers. A blowing agent must also be present. The
CFC blowing agents used for many years have been superceded, and water has now
become the principle blowing agent for such foams. However, in the present
invention, dissolved carbon dioxide or both dissolved carbon dioxide and minor
amounts of water are used as the blowing agent.</p>
    <p num="0009">The isocyanate component of the microcellular elastomer "system" or
"formulation" generally comprises an isocyanate-terminated prepolymer in major
part. Such prepolymers are well known, and are prepared by catalyzed or
uncatalyzed reaction of a stoichiometric excess of di- or polyisocyanate such as 2,4-toluene
diisocyanate (2,4-TDI), 4,4'-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (4,4'-MDI),
or modified MDI, with a polyol component. Other isocyanates can be used as well,
including mixtures of isocyanates. The polyol component used in preparing the
prepolymers ordinarily has a functionality of between 2.0 and 3.0, but may at times
be greater or less. The isocyanate content, expressed as weight percent isocyanate
groups, or " % NCO", may range from 3% to 24%, but is preferably in the range of
12% to 22%. The isocyanate content is most often 18-20% for shoe sole
applications.</p>
    <p num="0010">A single prepolymer or a mixture of prepolymers may be used. In
addition, the isocyanate component may comprise "monomeric" isocyanates such as
the various TDI isomers, the various MDI isomers, and modified isocyanates such
as urethane, urea, allophanate, and particularly, carbodiimide-modified isocyanates,
e.g., Mondur® CD available from Bayer. All these isocyanates are well known, and
can be used in mixtures as well. Aliphatic isocyanates such as isophorone
diisocyanate can also be used, but are not preferred. Mixtures of prepolymers and
"monomeric" isocyanates may also be used. The isocyanate content in such cases,
or where monomeric isocyanates alone are used, may be higher than 24%. </p>
    <p num="0011">In preparing the prepolymers, conventional polyether or polyester
polyols may be used, or low or ultra-low unsaturation polyether polyols may be
used. The polyol functionality is generally 2 or 3, although higher functionalities
may be used as well, particularly in minor quantities. Mixtures of lower and higher
functionality polyols are sometimes advantageous. The functionality, as expressed
herein, is the theoretical functionality based on the number of active hydrogens in the
starter molecules from which the polyether or polyester polyols are prepared, i.e.,
for any given polyol the theoretical functionality will be a whole number. Mixtures
of such polyols, for example polyols produced from a mixture of di- and trifunctional
starters may result in a theoretical functionality which is intermediate
between the starter functionalities. For example, a polyol produced from an
equimolar mixture of ethylene glycol and glycerine will have a theoretical
functionality of 2.5.</p>
    <p num="0012">The theoretical functionality must be distinguished from the actual, or
measured functionality, which will always, in the case of polyether polyols, be less
than theoretical due to side reactions which occur during polyoxyalkylation. For
example, a 3000 Dalton (Da) molecular weight polyether diol will have a theoretical
functionality of 2. If conventionally prepared by base catalyzed oxyalkylation, the
actual functionality may be 1.6, while if prepared using low unsaturation
polyoxyalkylation techniques, the actual functionality may range from 1.85 to about
1.97.</p>
    <p num="0013">The polyol component of the microcellular elastomer system
comprises conventional polyether and/or polyester polyols of moderate to high
molecular weight; chain extenders (functionality of 2); and crosslinkers (functionality
higher than 2). Both chain extenders and crosslinkers are of low molecular weight,
i.e., below 300 Da. Examples of crosslinkers include diethanolamine and
triethanolamine. Examples of chain extenders include ethylene glycol, 1,2- and 1,3-propanediol,
1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol,
neopentyl glycol, and 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol. </p>
    <p num="0014">Polyester polyols are well known, and are produced by condensation
of a glycol and/or polyol with a dicarboxylic acid or esterifyable or tranesterifyable
dicarboxylic acid derivative such as a lower alkanol ester or acid chloride. Examples
of glycols and polyols useful include ethylene glycol, 1,2- and 1,3-propylene glycol,
1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,4-cyclohexanediol,
glycerine, and the like. Suitable carboxylic acids or their derivatives include 1,4-butanedioic
acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, adipoyl chloride, azelaic acid, phthalic
acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, dimethylterephthalate, and the like.
Generally only minimal amounts of tri- or higher functionality monomers are
employed so as to minimize viscosity.</p>
    <p num="0015">The polyols useful, including both polyester and polyester polyols,
preferably have molecular weights in the range of 500 to 10,000 Da, more preferably
1000 to 8000 Da, most preferably 2000 to 6000 Da if diols, and somewhat higher in
each range if triols or tetrols. The overall average equivalent weight of the polyol
component, not considering chain extenders or crosslinkers, is generally in the range
of 1000 Da to 3000 Da, more preferably 1500 Da to 2000 Da. However, higher
equivalent weight polyether polyols, particularly those having unsaturation below
0.020 meq/g are also useful. The average theoretical functionality generally lies
between 1.5 and 4, more preferably between 2 and 3.</p>
    <p num="0016">In addition to polyether and polyester polyols, "polymer polyols" may
also be, and preferably are, employed. Polymer polyols are polyether or polyester
base polyols which contain dispersed polymer particles, generally stably dispersed.
While numerous polymer polyols are theoretically possible, and a variety are
commercially available, the most dominant and preferred polymer polyols are those
prepared by the <i>in situ</i> polymerization of unsaturated molecules in a base polyol,
often with the aid of an unsaturated "macromer" polyol as well. The unsaturated
monomers are most commonly acrylonitrile and styrene, and the acrylonitrile/styrene
copolymer particles are preferably stably dispersed in amounts of 10 to 60% by
weight based on total polymer polyol weight, more preferably 20 to 50%, and most 
preferably 30 to 45%. Such polymer polyols are available commercially, e.g.,
ARCOL® E850 polymer polyol containing 43 % polyacrylonitrile/polystyrene solids
available from Bayer.</p>
    <p num="0017">It has been unexpectedly discovered that the CO<sub>2</sub>-blown microcellular
elastomers of the subject invention prepared from low or ultra-low unsaturation
polyols, i.e., those having levels of unsaturation below 0.20 meq/g polyol (low) and
preferably below 0.010 meq/g polyol (ultra-low), exhibit high hardness at very low
densities. Ultra-low unsaturation polyether polyols are available as Accuflex® and
Acclaim® polyether polyols from Bayer, and have unsaturations in the range of 0.002
meq/g to 0.007 meq/g. These are particularly preferred. By "high hardness" is
meant high relative hardness as compared to a conventionally blown (CFC-blown)
foam of similar density. While the inventive very low density foams have high
relative hardness, the foams have hardness considerably lower than their water-blown
analogs. The hardness of the latter, particularly at low density, renders such
microcellular foams unsuitable for shoe sole applications.</p>
    <p num="0018">The hardness range of the subject invention microcellular foams is
preferably suitable for use in shoe soles, particularly midsole applications.
Preferably, the hardness is at least 60 when part density is about 0.50 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or less,
and at least 20 at densities of 0.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or less. The "hardness" is the Asker C
hardness. High hardness foams, for example those with hardness of 75 or more on
the Asker C scale are preferably avoided for midsole applications.</p>
    <p num="0019">Additives which may be added to the microcellular elastomer
formulations are well known. A surfactant suitable for maintaining stability of the
exceptionally fine cells is generally required, e.g., Dabco® SC5980, a silicone
surfactant available from Air Products Co. Other surfactants are well known to those
skilled in the art. Fillers, e.g., fumed or precipitated silica,, quartz flour,
diatomaceous earth, precipitated or ground calcium carbonate, alumina trihydrate,
titanium dioxide, and the like are also well known, as are dyes, pigments, ultraviolet
stabilizers, oxidative stabilizers, and the like. </p>
    <p num="0020">The microcellular formulations of the present invention are catalyzed.
Conventional polyurethane catalysts may be used. When water is used for a portion
of the blowing, a catalyst which catalyzes the isocyanate/water reaction should also
be present. Examples of suitable polyurethane catalysts include the various tin
catalysts, particularly tin octoate, dibutyltin diacetate, and dibutyltin dilaurate, and
dimethyltin dimercaptide, bismuth catalysts, and tertiary amine catalysts such as
Dabco® 1027 from Air Products. Some catalysts are capable of catalyzing both the
urethane reaction as well as the isocyanate/water reaction. In such cases, only one
catalyst is necessary even when water is employed.</p>
    <p num="0021">The reactive elastomer formulations are generally formulated at
isocyanate indices of 90 to 120, preferably 95 to 105, and most preferably about 100.
The formulation of the reactants, including selection of isocyanates, polyols,
catalysts, fillers, surfactants, etc., is well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p num="0022">The microcellular elastomers are predominately blown with gaseous
carbon dioxide which is not introduced as a gas or liquid into the mix head, but is
dissolved as a gas under pressure into at least one of the isocyanate or polyol (resin)
components. Preferably, carbon dioxide is dissolved into both components, and most
preferably is used as the sole blowing agent.</p>
    <p num="0023">The carbon dioxide is introduced at modest pressure into the
respective component storage tanks of the foam machine, and given sufficient time
to dissolve to the extent necessary. The amount dissolved may be measured by any
convenient technique, including relative rates of diffusion through a membrane
detector. The amount dissolved may range from 0.05 g/L to 3 g/L, preferably 0.5
g/L to 2 g/L, and more preferably 0.8 g/L to about 1.5 g/L. The higher the amount
of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, the lower the component density. The carbon dioxide may be
conveniently fed to the storage tank at 50 lb/in<sup>2</sup> pressure, for a time sufficient to
dissolve the desired amount of carbon dioxide. Unless specified otherwise in the
claims, the amount of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> is the average concentrations in g/L based on 
the amounts of the isocyanate (iso) and polyol (resin) components. The CO<sub>2</sub>
concentration may be conveniently measured with a Rosemount Analytical Inc. D-CO2
Analyzer.</p>
    <p num="0024">The two or more reactant streams, generally one polyol (resin) stream
and one isocyanate (iso) stream may be combined by any suitable method for
preparation of microcellular elastomers, including low pressure and high pressure
heads. A low pressure shoesole molding machine (i.e., Desma RGE 395) may be
advantageously used. It is necessary, when practicing the subject invention, that the
resin and/or iso side(s) already contain dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>. Adding CO<sub>2</sub> only at the mix
head or in a frother (i.e., a Oakes mixer)will not produce acceptable elastomers.</p>
    <p num="0025">The benefits of the subject process are that considerable reduction of
chain extender is possible when producing low density microcellular elastomers, thus
enlarging the processing window and reducing splits and shrinkage. In addition,
water may be substantially or wholly eliminated, thus decreasing the quantity of urea
groups produced. Preferably, the subject process employs less than 50% by weight
of the amount of water which would produce a microcellular foam of the same
density without CO<sub>2</sub> blowing agent. Most preferably the subject process employs
less than 30% of this amount, and more preferably less than 20% of this amount.
Less than 10% of the above amount of water is very advantageous, with the best
results achieved with no added water. At the same time, CO<sub>2</sub> must provide
minimally 50% of the blowing. Despite the avoidance of water, and thus also the
urea "hard" segments produced in the water-blowing reaction with isocyanate, the
subject elastomers are actually harder than elastomers of the same density produced
with CFCs as the blowing agent when low unsaturation polyols are used. This high
hardness is completely surprising and unexpected. However, the hardness at very
low density is in the range suitable for use in shoe sole components, while all-water
blown microcellular foams have unacceptably high hardness. </p>

blowing agents produced a good quality microcellular part with good surface,
uniform cells, and substantially no shrinkage. The all water-blown foam produced
significant shrinkage, had a poor surface, and a morphology characterized by

attempt was made to produce a softer elastomer (Comparative Example) in an all-water-blown
formulation by decreasing the chain extender amount to 9.2 parts.

E501 from Bayer. The resulting foam has a density of less than 0.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup> with
improved dimensional stability and mechanical properties. Ordinarily, low density
polyester based polyurethanes are difficult to foam. Water and/or CFC-blown
