  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a containment assembly with improved gloved
access to a processing zone.</p>
    <p num="0002">Effective containment is essential for the safe and hygienic handling of a
pharmaceutical, chemical or biological product. At each stage, handling must be controlled
and managed to provide optimum protection for the operator and for maintaining the
integrity of the product. At the conclusion of each processing operation, the interior
surfaces of the structure enclosing the processing zone must be thoroughly cleaned by the
operator prior to a further processing operation to minimise the risk of cross-contamination.
Current Good Manufacturing Practices exercised within the pharmaceutical manufacturing
industry demand good containment performance and acceptable operator exposure levels.</p>
    <p num="0003">For handling a solid (<i>eg</i> powder) or liquid product of a sensitive or hazardous (<i>eg</i>
toxic) nature in a processing zone, there are available a number of different types of
containment assembly. One such conventional containment assembly is a barrier isolator
with gloved access to the processing zone in which a product and/or handling equipment
may be manipulated. A barrier isolator may offer two fold protection, namely the use of
glove ports to maintain a physical barrier between the product and the operator and a fan
system to create air flow for removing airborne particles from the processing zone and into
filters. In this manner, a barrier isolator can achieve high containment typically down to
nanogramme level. Frequently, a barrier isolator is adapted to provide net inward air flow
(<i>ie</i> exhibit a negative pressure relative to the environment). This lessens the risk of
airborne particles entering the environment, in particular in the event of glove failure.</p>
    <p num="0004">Gloved access to the processing zone in a barrier isolator of this type is typically
achieved in the manner illustrated schematically in partial cross-sectional view in Figures
1a-d. An access wall 1 of the isolator contains a substantially circular aperture and is fitted
with a glove port 2 (<i>eg</i> by an adhesive) near to the circumference of the aperture. The
glove port 2 comprises a lower retaining groove 4 and an upper retaining groove 8. In the
normal working condition, a glove 3 is retained in the lower retaining groove 4 by virtue of 
a strengthening ring 9. Between the interior surface 5 of the glove port 2 and the glove 3 is
a void 6. The void 6 is more pronounced when the isolator is operated under negative
pressure.</p>
    <p num="0005">During normal operation or during the cleaning cycle, debris from a solid (<i>eg</i>
powder) or liquid product or cleaning agents may become trapped in the void 6. Since the
void 6 is to all intents and purposes inaccessible by the operator, it cannot be effectively
cleaned and therefore seriously compromises the containment performance of the isolator.
Moreover it will be seen from Figures 1b to d that the glove change procedure serves to
withdraw the trapped debris into the processing zone. A replacement glove 7 is fitted in
the upper retaining groove 8 over the existing glove 3. The existing glove 3 is removed
from the lower retaining groove 4 (see X), pushed through the glove port 2 and the aperture
in the access wall 1 and removed from the processing zone via the normal exit. The
replacement glove 7 may then be re-positioned into the lower retaining groove 4 ready for
use (see Y).</p>
    <p num="0006">The present invention is based on the recognition that eliminating the void
between the glove and the interior surface of the glove port improves the performance of a
containment assembly by reducing the risk of cross-contamination. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a containment assembly adapted to confine the portion of the
glove adjacent to the interior surface of the glove port so as to lessen the risk of debris
being trapped.</p>
    <p num="0007">Thus viewed from one aspect the present invention provides a containment
assembly (<i>eg</i> an isolator) comprising:
<sl><li>a walled housing erected so as to enclose a processing zone beyond an access wall
thereof;</li><li>a substantially circular aperture within the access wall;</li><li>a substantially cylindrical glove port fitted to the access wall at or near to the
circumference of and coaxial with the substantially circular aperture, an exterior surface of
which extends into a retaining portion at the front of the access wall; </li><li>a flexible glove retained on the retaining portion of the glove port, said flexible
glove being adapted or adaptable to permit an operator outside the processing zone to reach
through the substantially circular aperture of the access wall into the processing zone; and</li><li>a confinement member positioned so as to confine a part of the flexible glove
against an interior surface of the substantially cylindrical glove port.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0008">Preferably the walled housing is faceted with the substantially circular aperture
within one face thereof. Particularly preferably the walled housing is multi-faceted with
the substantially circular aperture within one face thereof. Typically, the walled housing
adopts a substantially cuboidal configuration (<i>eg</i> a box-like configuration) having a rear
wall, a front wall, a basal wall, a first side wall, a second side wall and an upper wall,
wherein the front wall is the access wall.</p>
    <p num="0009">The substantially circular aperture within the access wall of the walled housing
may be circular, elliptical or oval as desired. However it is not intended to exclude other
shapes (<i>eg</i> curved, partially curved or non-curved shapes) from the scope of the invention.
It will be appreciated that the substantially cylindrical glove port may be shaped to conform
to the shape of the substantially circular aperture so as to be fitted to the access wall at or
near to the circumference thereof and coaxial therewith.</p>
    <p num="0010">In a preferred embodiment, the confinement member is a substantially cylindrical
confinement member at least partially, coaxially inserted into the substantially cylindrical
glove port so as to confine a part of the flexible glove against the interior surface of the
substantially cylindrical glove port.</p>
    <p num="0011">In a preferred embodiment, the confinement member extends radially and
outwardly into a flange adapted to be secured to the front of the access wall. For example,
the substantially cylindrical confinement member extends radially and outwardly into an
annular flange adapted to be secured to the front of the access wall. The flange may have a
bore (<i>eg</i> a countersunk bore) for receiving a fastener (<i>eg</i> a threaded fastener such as a
screw) which may secure the flange to the front of the access wall directly or indirectly. </p>
    <p num="0012">Preferably the annular flange incorporates an annular recess encapsulating the
retaining portion of the substantially cylindrical glove port. By protectively encapsulating
the retaining portion, this embodiment has the added advantage that the risk of glove
failure or of accidental dislodgement of the flexible glove is reduced.</p>
    <p num="0013">In an embodiment of the invention, the substantially cylindrical glove port is fitted
to the front face of the access wall at or near to the circumference of and coaxial with the
substantially circular aperture.</p>
    <p num="0014">In a preferred embodiment, the substantially cylindrical glove port is fitted at or
near to the edge of the access wall bounding the substantially circular aperture. Preferably
the substantially cylindrical glove port is fitted near to the edge of the access wall bounding
the substantially circular aperture (<i>ie</i> there is a narrow gap between the edge of the access
wall bounding the substantially circular aperture and the substantially cylindrical glove
port).</p>
    <p num="0015">The substantially cylindrical glove port may be fitted to the front face of the access
wall or at or near to the edge of the access wall bounding the substantially circular aperture
in any convenient manner such as mechanically and/or adhesively (<i>eg</i> using conventional
adhesives and/or fasteners such as threaded fasteners for example screws).</p>
    <p num="0016">In this regard, the containment assembly preferably further comprises:
<sl><li>a clamping ring bearing against the front face of the access wall, said clamping
ring being adapted to secure the substantially cylindrical glove port at or near to the edge of
the access wall bounding the substantially circular aperture.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0017">For example, the clamping ring may incorporate a first bore capable of receiving a fastener
(<i>eg</i> a threaded fastener), said first bore being collinear with a receiving bore in the
substantially cylindrical glove port, said receiving bore being capable of receiving the
fastener (<i>eg</i> the threaded fastener). For this purpose, the substantially cylindrical glove port
may extend radially and outwardly into a flange bearing against the rear face of the access
wall. In a preferred embodiment, the clamping ring may incorporate a second bore capable 
of receiving a second fastener (<i>eg</i> a second threaded fastener), said second bore being
collinear with the bore in the flange extending radially and outwardly from the confinement
member (as described in the embodiment hereinbefore). In this manner, the flange may be
indirectly secured to the front of the access wall.</p>
    <p num="0018">The exterior surface of the substantially cylindrical glove port may extend radially
or axially into the retaining portion. Preferably the exterior surface of the substantially
cylindrical glove port extends axially away from the front of the access wall to define a
retaining portion incorporating a first retaining groove and a second retaining groove. The
first and/or second retaining groove is typically an annular retaining groove. Preferably the
first retaining groove is disposed forwardly of the second retaining groove and is generally
shallower than the second retaining groove. The first retaining groove may define a
substantially square cross-section. The first retaining groove is generally used to retain the
flexible glove during normal operation of the containment assembly. The second retaining
groove may define a curved (<i>eg</i> substantially hemispherical) cross-section. The second
retaining groove is generally used to retain a replacement flexible glove during a glove
change operation.</p>
    <p num="0019">Generally speaking the flexible glove is composed of natural rubber (latex),
Hypalon, neoprene, butyl and polyurethane rubbers. The flexible glove may be retained in
the retaining portion in any conventional manner. For example, the rolled edge of the
flexible glove may be sufficient to retain it in the retaining portion. A strengthening ring
<i>(eg</i> an o-ring) may be used to positively retain the flexible glove in the retaining portion.</p>
    <p num="0020">In a preferred embodiment, the flexible glove comprises a flexible sleeve
terminating in a gloved end. Preferably, in use the flexible sleeve extends beyond the
operator's elbow to optimise manoeuvrability. The gloved end is typically composed of
less flexible material than the flexible sleeve. For example, the gloved end may be
composed of thicker polyurethane than that of the flexible sleeve (or alternatively of thicker
PVC or other material). </p>
    <p num="0021">The gloved end may be attached to the flexible sleeve in any conventional manner.
Preferably, the joint between the gloved end and the flexible sleeve comprises an internal
strengthening ring to which the ends of the gloved end and the flexible sleeve are secured.
For example, the ends of the gloved end and the flexible sleeve may be secured to the
internal strengthening ring by an elastic band or the like.</p>
    <p num="0022">Typically, the position and orientation of the flexible glove may be tailored to suit
the particular operation to be conducted in the processing zone. For example, the flexible
glove may be right-hand orientated or left-hand orientated as desired.</p>
    <p num="0023">Where appropriate, a plurality of substantially circular apertures may be provided
within the access wall of the walled housing. One or more additional walls of the walled
housing may be provided with one or more substantially circular apertures. Each of these
may be separately provided with a glove port and flexible glove in accordance with the
invention.</p>
    <p num="0024">In a preferred embodiment, the confinement member (<i>eg</i> the substantially
cylindrical confinement member) sealingly confines the part of the flexible glove against
the interior surface of the substantially cylindrical glove port.</p>
    <p num="0025">For this purpose, the interior surface of the substantially cylindrical glove port
advantageously extends radially and inwardly into a retaining shoulder, said retaining
shoulder being in substantially sealing engagement with the end of the confinement
member. The retaining shoulder may be disposed at or near to the end of the interior
surface of the substantially cylindrical glove port. Preferably the retaining shoulder is an
annular retaining shoulder. Preferably, the retaining shoulder is of a substantially triangular
cross-section and is in sealing engagement with the end of the confinement member. For
this purpose, the end of the confinement member may be chamfered to mate with the
retaining shoulder and improve the sealing engagement.</p>
    <p num="0026">The air quality in and around the processing zone may be controlled using forced
ventilation. For example, the containment assembly may be adapted to provide non-circulatory 
air flow in the processing zone. For this purpose, air exhausted from the
processing zone may be ducted to atmosphere or to a remote location. Alternatively, the
containment assembly may be adapted to provide recirculatory air flow in the processing
zone (<i>eg</i> "down flow" in which surrounding air is pushed downwardly to entrain airborne
particles to a level below the processing zone <i>eg</i> to a level below the typical operator's
breathing zone). For down flow containment, exhaust is usually carried out at low level
relative to the source of particles.</p>
    <p num="0027">The containment assembly of the invention may be any of the types which utilise
gloved access including isolators, fume cupboards and filter scan boxes. The versatility of
the containment assembly of the invention is such that it may be used in numerous
applications including the containment of chemical, pharmaceutical or biological <i>(eg</i>
microbiological) powders or liquids.</p>
    <p num="0028">Viewed from a further aspect the present invention provides a containment
member as hereinbefore defined.</p>
    <p num="0029">The present invention will now be described in a non-limitative sense with
reference to accompanying Figure 2 in which:
<sl><li>Figures 2a-e illustrate an embodiment of the containment assembly of the
invention and the safe change procedure.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0030">In the embodiment illustrated schematically in partial cross-sectional view in
Figures 2a-e, an access wall 1 of a walled housing contains a substantially circular aperture.
Near to an edge 3 of the access wall 1 bounding the aperture is fitted a substantially
cylindrical glove port 2. The exterior surface of the substantially cylindrical glove port 2
extends axially into a retaining portion 5 at the front face 4 of the access wall 1. The
retaining portion 5 incorporates a first annular retaining groove 6 of square cross-section
and a second annular retaining groove 7 of curved cross-section. In the normal working
condition illustrated in Figure 2a, a glove 8 is fitted in the first annular retaining groove 6
by the action of a strengthening o-ring 9. </p>
    <p num="0031">The substantially cylindrical glove port 2 extends radially and outwardly into a
flange 16 bearing against the rear face 17 of the access wall 1. The substantially cylindrical
glove port 2 is secured near to the edge 3 of the access wall 1 bounding the aperture by a
clamping ring 10 bearing against the front face 4 of the access wall 1. A threaded fastener
11 passes through collinear, threaded bores in the clamping ring 10 and substantially
cylindrical glove port 2 to secure the glove port 2 in place.</p>
    <p num="0032">A substantially cylindrical confinement member 12 is coaxially inserted into the
substantially cylindrical glove port 2 so as to confine a part of the flexible glove 8a against
the interior surface 2a of the substantially cylindrical glove port. A seal is effectively
formed between the end 12a of the substantially cylindrical confinement member 12 and an
annular shoulder 70 extending radially inwardly from the interior surface 2a of the
substantially cylindrical glove port 2.</p>
    <p num="0033">The substantially cylindrical confinement member 12 extends radially outwardly
into an annular flange 13 encapsulating the retaining portion 5 of the substantially
cylindrical glove port 2. The annular flange 13 is provided with a threaded bore 14 which
receives a threaded fastener 15 for securing the confinement member 12 to the clamping
ring 10 (and therefore indirectly to the front face of the access wall 3).</p>
    <p num="0034">Figures 2b-e illustrate schematically the glove change procedure. In the first step
(Figure 2b), the substantially cylindrical confinement member 12 is removed by releasing
the threaded fastener 14 to expose the clamping ring 10. In the second step (Figure 2c), a
strengthening ring 21 of a replacement glove 20 is fitted in the second annular retaining
groove 7 of the substantially cylindrical glove portion 2 over the old glove 8. In the next
step (Figure 2d), the old glove 8 is dislodged from the first annular retaining groove 6 and
pushed through the glove port 2 and removed from the processing zone via the normal exit.
In the next step the glove ring 21 of the glove 20 is dislodged from the second annular
retaining groove 7 and inserted into the first annular retaining groove 6. The confinement
member 12 is repositioned and re-fastened using threaded fastener 14 leaving the glove
ready for use.</p>
