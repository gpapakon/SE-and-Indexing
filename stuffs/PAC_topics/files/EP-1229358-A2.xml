    <p>An optical fiber composite that can easily have a desired mean transmission
property as a whole even after a length of optical fiber is cut off from one end or
both ends, a cable comprising the composites, and methods for producing the
composite and cable. An optical fiber composite (10) is produced by splicing a

order. The first optical fiber (11) and the third optical fiber (13) each have a first
chromatic dispersion, D<sub>1</sub>, at the wavelength of a signal-carrying lightwave. The
second optical fiber (12) has a second chromatic dispersion, D<sub>2</sub>, at the wavelength
of the signal-carrying lightwave. The third optical fiber has a length, L<sub>3</sub>,
shorter than the length, L<sub>1</sub>, of the first optical fiber. It is desirable that the ratio
L<sub>3</sub>/ L<sub>1</sub> be at most 0.1.

    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to an optical fiber composite in which two types
of optical fibers having a chromatic dispersion opposite in sign to each other at
the wavelength of a signal-carrying lightwave are spliced in cascade, an optical
fiber cable comprising a plurality of the optical fiber composites, and methods
for producing the optical fiber composite and the optical fiber cable.</p>
    <heading>Description of the Background Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">Optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transmission systems enable
large-capacity optical communication by using a plurality of wavelengths.
Optical fiber transmission lines to be installed in the repeater sections of a
WDM transmission system are required to have an excellent transmission
property in the wavelength band of the signal-carrying lightwave, for example,
a 1.55 µm-wavelength band. In order to meet this requirement, researchers and
engineers have proposed optical fiber transmission lines having an ununiform
transmission property along the length of the transmission line.</p>
    <p num="0003">For example, a first literature (<i>T. Naito,</i> et al., "1 Terabit/s WDM Transmission
over 10,000 km," ECOC' 99, PD2-1, 1999) states an optical fiber transmission
line consisting of the first optical fiber placed at the upstream side and the 
second optical fiber placed at the downstream side in terms of the propagation
direction of a signal. The first optical fiber has a positive chromatic dispersion
and a relatively large mode-field diameter at a 1.55-µm-wavelength band. The
second optical fiber, a dispersion-compensating optical fiber (DCF), has a negative
chromatic dispersion and a relatively small mode-field diameter at a 1.55-µm-wavelength
band.</p>
    <p num="0004">With this optical fiber transmission line, although a signal-carrying lightwave
is intense when it starts to propagate in the first optical fiber, nonlinear
optical phenomena seldom occur because the first optical fiber has a relatively
large mode-field diameter. The lightwave decreases its intensity during the
propagation through the first optical fiber. Because the lightwave with decreased
intensity propagates through the second optical fiber, nonlinear optical
phenomena seldom occur despite the second optical fiber having a relatively
small mode-field diameter. In addition, because the two optical fibers have a
chromatic dispersion opposite in sign to each other, a proper selection of the
ratio of the lengths between the two optical fibers enables the overall chromatic
dispersion of the entire optical fiber transmission line to be nearly zero. As described
above, signal degrading due to the generation of nonlinear optical phenomena
and a large value of overall chromatic dispersion can be avoided by
using an optical fiber transmission line in which the first optical fiber and the
second optical fiber are spliced in cascade in terms of the propagation direction
of a signal-carrying lightwave.</p>
    <p num="0005">A second literature, U.S. Patent 5,894,537 entitled "Dispersion Managed Optical 
Waveguide," discloses an optical fiber transmission line in which a section
having a positive chromatic dispersion at the wavelength band of a signal-carrying
lightwave and another section having a negative chromatic dispersion
at the same wavelength band are provided alternately and successively in the
longitudinal direction. Because both sections are designed to have a large absolute
value in chromatic dispersion, the occurrence of nonlinear optical phenomena
such as four-wave mixing can be suppressed. Furthermore, because
the overall chromatic dispersion of the entire optical fiber transmission line is
designed to be small in absolute value, the degradation in the transmission
quality can be suppressed.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0006">An object of the present invention is to offer an optical fiber composite easily
provided with a desired transmission property as a whole even after a length of
optical fiber is cut off from one or both ends, an optical fiber cable comprising
the optical fiber composites, and methods for producing the optical fiber composite
and the optical fiber cable.</p>
    <p num="0007">In order to achieve this object, the present invention offers an optical fiber
composite in which the following three optical fibers are spliced in cascade in
this order:
<sl><li>(a) the first optical fiber having a first chromatic dispersion, D<sub>1</sub>, at the
wavelength of a signal-carrying lightwave;</li><li>(b) the second optical fiber having a second chromatic dispersion, D<sub>2</sub>, at the
wavelength of the signal-carrying lightwave, with the second chromatic dispersion 
having the sign opposite to that of D<sub>1</sub>; and</li><li>(c) the third optical fiber that has the same chromatic dispersion, D<sub>1</sub>, as the
first optical fiber at the wavelength of the signal-carrying lightwave and
that is shorter than the first optical fiber.</li></sl> </p>
    <p num="0008">The optical fiber composite is produced by the following steps:
<sl><li>(a) determining the length, L<sub>2</sub>, of the second optical fiber by using the following
parameters:
<sl><li>the chromatic dispersion, D<sub>1</sub>, of the first and third optical fibers;</li><li>the chromatic dispersion, D<sub>2</sub>, of the second optical fiber;</li><li>the designed length, L<sub>t</sub>, of the optical fiber composite; and</li><li>the designed mean chromatic dispersion, D<sub>m</sub>, of the optical fiber composite;</li></sl></li><li>(b) splicing the second optical fiber, having the length L<sub>2</sub>, to one end of the
first optical fiber and splicing the third optical fiber to the free end of the
second optical fiber; and</li><li>(c) cutting off a length of optical fiber from at least one free end of the first
and third optical fibers so that the total length of the optical fiber composite
can be adjusted to the designed length, L<sub>t</sub>, with the third optical fiber being
shorter than the first optical fiber.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0009">In an embodiment of the above-described optical fiber composite; the ratio of
the length, L<sub>3</sub>, of the third optical fiber to the length, L<sub>1</sub>, of the first optical fiber
(L<sub>3</sub>/ L<sub>1</sub>) may be 0.1 or less; or the length, L<sub>3</sub>, of the third optical fiber may be 1
km or less. Furthermore, the absolute value of the chromatic dispersion D<sub>2</sub> may 
be larger than that of chromatic dispersion D<sub>1</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0010">The optical fiber cable of the present invention is a bundle of a plurality of
the above-described optical fiber composites and is produced by the following
steps:
<sl><li>(a) determining the length, L<sub>2</sub>, of the second optical fiber by using the following
parameters:
<sl><li>the chromatic dispersion, D<sub>1</sub>, of the first and third optical fibers;</li><li>the chromatic dispersion, D<sub>2</sub>, of the second optical fiber;</li><li>the designed length, L<sub>t</sub>, of the optical fiber composite; and</li><li>the designed mean chromatic dispersion, D<sub>m</sub>, of the optical fiber composite;</li></sl></li><li>(b) producing an optical fiber composite by splicing the second optical fiber,
having the length L<sub>2</sub>, to one end of the first optical fiber and splicing the
third optical fiber to the free end of the second optical fiber;</li><li>(c) forming an optical fiber cable by bundling together a plurality of the optical
fiber composites; and</li><li>(d) cutting off a length of optical fiber from at least one free end of the first
and third optical fibers of each of the optical fiber composites in the optical
fiber cable so that the total length of the optical fiber composite can be adjusted
to the designed length, L<sub>t</sub>, with the third optical fiber being shorter
than the first optical fiber.</li></sl></p>

The designed length, L<sub>t</sub>, and the designed mean chromatic dispersion, D<sub>m</sub>, of 
the optical fiber composite 10 are also determined. The length, L<sub>2</sub>, of the second
optical fiber is determined in accordance with equations (2) and (3) using the
chromatic dispersions D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>, the designed length L<sub>t</sub>, and the designed mean
chromatic dispersion D<sub>m</sub> (see Fig. 2A).</p>
    <p num="0022">The second optical fiber 12, having a length of L<sub>2</sub>, is provided. The first optical

spliced to the other end of the second optical fiber 12 (see Fig. 2B). In the above

ΔL<sub>1</sub> and ΔL<sub>3</sub> is zero or more.</p>
    <p num="0023">A length of optical fiber is cut off from at least one free end of the first optical
fiber 11 and the third optical fiber 13. In the case of Fig. 2C, both free ends are
cut, so that the completed optical fiber composite 10 has the first optical fiber
11 with a length of L<sub>1</sub> and the third optical fiber 13 with a length of L<sub>3</sub>. This
process produces the optical fiber composite 10 that has a designed length of L<sub>t</sub>,
that has the third optical fiber 13 whose length, L<sub>3</sub>, is shorter than the length,

    <p num="0025">A signal-carrying lightwave propagates from an end, 10a, to the other end,
10b, of the optical fiber composite 10. A signal-carrying lightwave having relatively
large power propagates in the first optical fiber 11. Because the first optical
fiber 11 has an effective core area larger than that of the second optical fiber
12 in the downstream, nonlinear optical phenomena seldom occur. The first
optical fiber 11 has a relatively long length, L<sub>1</sub>, so that the lightwave decreases
its power during the propagation through the first optical fiber 11. Because the
lightwave with decreased power propagates through the second optical fiber 12,
the degradation in transmission quality due to generation of nonlinear optical
phenomena can be suppressed.</p>
    <p num="0026">From the viewpoint of the above-described phenomena, the foregoing degradation
can be suppressed more effectively when the ratio of the length, L<sub>3</sub>, of
the third optical fiber 13 to the length, L<sub>1</sub>, of the first optical fiber 11 (L<sub>3</sub>/L<sub>1</sub>) is
0.1 or less, more desirably 0.03 or less. In addition, when the third optical fiber
13 has a length, L<sub>3</sub>, of 1 km or less, the foregoing degradation can also be suppressed
more effectively.</p>
    <p num="0027">It is desirable that the optical fiber composite 10 have a second chromatic

    <p num="0038">Figures 5A to 5D are diagrams illustrating a method for producing a conventional
optical fiber cable. Figure 5A shows an optical fiber composite before
stranding, Fig. 5B shows the stranded optical fiber composites, Fig. 5C shows
the composites after the welding of a water-pressure-resistant copper tube, and
Fig. 5D shows the optical fiber cable after the extrusion of a protective covering.
The optical fiber cable has the cross-sectional structure shown in Figs. 4A and
4B. Each of the optical fiber composites 48 comprises an SMF having a chromatic
dispersion of 20 ps/nm/km and a DCF having a chromatic dispersion of -
45 ps/nm/km.</p>
    <p num="0039">As shown in Fig. 5B, when the stranding of a plurality of optical fiber composites
48 is completed, a 10-meter-long optical fiber is cut off from each free
end of the SMFs and an 80-meter-long optical fiber is cut off from each free end
of the DCFs. As shown in Fig. 5C, when the water-pressure-resistant copper
tube is welded, a 90-meter-long optical fiber is cut off from each free end of the
SMFs and a 350-meter-long optical fiber is cut off from each free end of the
DCFs. As shown in Fig. 5D, when the protective covering is extruded, a 150-meter-long
optical fiber is cut off from each free end of the SMFs and a 70-meter-long 
optical fiber is cut off from each free end of the DCFs. When the
above process is finished, a total of 250 meters of optical fiber is cut off from
each of the SMFs and the chromatic dispersion varies by the amount of 5 ps/nm.
Similarly, a total of 500 meters of optical fiber is cut off from each of the DCFs
and the chromatic dispersion varies by the amount of -22.5 ps/nm. As a result,
the overall chromatic dispersion of each of the optical fiber composites in the
completed optical fiber cable varies by an amount no less than -17.5 ps/nm.</p>
    <p num="0040">If it is possible to predict the length of optical fiber to be cut off from both
ends of an optical fiber composite, it is possible to design and produce an optical
fiber composite to be included in an optical fiber cable by taking into account
the amount of variation in overall chromatic dispersion, because the amount of
variation corresponds to the cut-off length of optical fiber as described above.
However, the cut-off length varies considerably according to the variation in
the conditions of each stage in the production process of an optical fiber cable.
Consequently, it is difficult to accurately predict the cut-off length of optical
fiber during the production process of an optical fiber cable, which means that
it is difficult to accurately predict the amount of variation in overall chromatic
dispersion when the cable is completed.</p>
    <p num="0041">Notwithstanding the above-described difficulty, a submarine optical fiber
cable is required to comprise optical fiber composites that have an overall
chromatic dispersion coinciding with the designed value within an error of several
of ps/nm on the average. However, as explained in the above example,
overall chromatic dispersion can vary as much as several tens of ps/nm due to 
cutting-off of optical fibers. Because the amount of variation in overall chromatic
dispersion depends on the cut-off length of optical fibers, it is difficult to
produce an optical fiber composite whose overall chromatic dispersion coincides
with the designed value within an error of several of ps/nm. Such a problem is
particularly serious in the case of a submarine optical fiber cable, because a
submarine cable constitutes an entire repeater section with one length. (Of
course, land cables have a similar problem). In the above explanation, the term
"a repeater section" is used to mean any of the following three sections: a section
from a transmitting station to a repeater station including an optical amplifier
and other equipment, a section from a repeater station to the next repeater
station, and a section from a repeater station to a receiving station.</p>
    <p num="0042">As can be seen from the explanation in Comparative Example, the conventional
optical fiber transmission lines stated in the first and second literatures
cannot have the intended mean transmission property when a length of optical
fiber is cut off from the end portion. Even when they are designed to have a
desired mean transmission property as a whole, the cutting-off of a length of
optical fiber from the end portion inhibits this intention. In particular, when an
optical fiber having a large absolute value in chromatic dispersion is used at an
end portion of an optical fiber transmission line as stated in the first and second
literatures, the cutting-off of a length of optical fiber from the end portion
causes a considerable variation in the overall chromatic dispersion of the optical
fiber transmission line. </p>
    <p num="0043">The present invention is not limited by the above-explained embodiments;
several variants can be implemented. For example, in the optical fiber cable 1
in one of the embodiments (see Figs. 3C and 3D), all the first optical fibers, 11<sub>1</sub>
to 11<sub>6</sub>, and the third optical fibers, 13<sub>1</sub> to 13<sub>6</sub>, have the same chromatic dispersion,
D<sub>1</sub>, at the wavelength of a signal-carrying lightwave, and all the second
optical fibers, 12<sub>1</sub> to 12<sub>6</sub>, have the same chromatic dispersion, D<sub>2</sub>, at the wavelength
of the signal-carrying lightwave and have the same length, L<sub>2</sub>. However,
it is sufficient for the first optical fiber, 11<sub>n</sub>, and the third optical fiber, 13<sub>n</sub>, to
have the same chromatic dispersion, D<sub>1</sub>, for each value of the parameter "n."
The chromatic dispersions D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> can vary with the parameter "n." Similarly,
the length, L<sub>2</sub>, of the second optical fiber 12<sub>n</sub> can vary with the parameter "n."</p>
