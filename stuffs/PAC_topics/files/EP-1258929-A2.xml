  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">Semiconductor light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are among the most efficient
light sources currently available. Materials systems currently of interest in the manufacture of
high-brightness LEDs capable of operation across the visible spectrum include Group III-V
semiconductors, particularly binary, ternary, and quaternary alloys of gallium, aluminum,
indium, and nitrogen, also referred to as III-nitride materials. Typically, III-nitride devices
are epitaxially grown on sapphire, silicon carbide, or III-nitride substrates by metal-organic
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), or other epitaxial
techniques. Some of these substrates are insulating or poorly conducting. Devices fabricated
from semiconductor crystals grown on such substrates must have both the positive and the
negative polarity electrical contacts to the epitaxially-grown semiconductor on the same side
of the device. In contrast, semiconductor devices grown on conducting substrates can be
fabricated such that one electrical contact is formed on the epitaxially grown material and the
other electrical contact is formed on the substrate. However, devices fabricated on conducting
substrates may also be designed to have both contacts on the same side of the device on
which the epitaxial material is grown in a flip-chip geometry so as to improve light extraction
from LED chip, to improve the current-carrying capacity of the chip, or to improve the heat-sinking
of the LED die.</p>
    <p num="0002">In order to fabricate efficient LED devices, the contacts must be electrically
isolated from each other such that electrical carriers of the appropriate polarity are injected
into the p-type and n-type sides of the semiconductor junction, where they recombine to
produce light. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical III-nitride LED device. Semiconductor layers,
including, for example, n-layer 12, active region 13, and p-layer 14 are epitaxially grown on
substrate 11. P-contact 15 and n-contact 17 are formed on the same side of the device as
described above. Electrical isolation between the p-contact 15 and the n-contact 17 is
achieved by etching a mesa structure 18 into the device extending from the topmost layer
down into the underlying n-layer and forming separate, defined p-contact 15 and n-contact
17. The LED is mounted to a submount assembly 22, which typically includes a submount on
which the LED is mounted with solder bumps. The solder bumps create a gap between the 
submount and the LED. The connected LED and submount assembly are then typically
encapsulated in a high index of refraction gel or epoxy.</p>
    <p num="0003">The high index gel or epoxy is selected to match the index of refraction of the
sapphire substrate as closely as possible, since the light produced in the device is extracted
through the sapphire substrate. When light is incident on an interface between two materials,
the difference in index of refraction determines how much light is reflected at that interface,
and how much light is transmitted through it. The larger the difference in index of refraction,
the more light is reflected. Thus, the small difference between the index of refraction of the
sapphire substrate and the high index gel encapsulating the device ensures that most of the
light generated in the device that reaches the emitting surfaces of the sapphire substrate is
extracted from the device.</p>
    <p num="0004">Photons are generated efficiently within active region 13, but extracting the
photons from the semiconductor into the LED package and to the outside world is difficult, in
part due to the high indices of refraction of the semiconductor layers. See, for example,
Windisch et al., Applied Physics Letters, vol. 74, no. 16, p2256 (1999). Photons generated
within the epitaxial semiconductor are incident upon either the interface between the
semiconductor and substrate 11, the interface at mesa wall 18 between the semiconductor and
the high index gel in submount assembly 22, or the interface between the semiconductor and
the metal contacts. Photons incident on any of the three interfaces face a step in material
refractive index. Such a step in refractive index causes a ray 20 incident on such an interface
to be split into a transmitted portion 20a and a reflected portion 20b. Light transmitted out
from mesa wall 18 (i.e. portion 20a) cannot be directed out of the device in a useful direction,
thus light lost through transmission at mesa wall 18 contributes to the low light extraction
efficiency of semiconductor LEDs.</p>
    <p num="0005">The high index gel encapsulating the device results in a small difference in
refractive index at the interface at mesa wall 18 between the semiconductor area between the
contacts and the submount assembly. As a result, much of the light incident on this area is
transmitted in the direction of the submount assembly, which causes significant optical loss.
As described above, light extracted in this area towards the submount assembly cannot be
usefully extracted from the package; rather, it is incident on the submount where it is
absorbed. The device area between the contacts on a device such as that shown in Fig. 1 is
estimated at 10% of the total area. This area includes the mesa wall and a small portion of
semiconductor material parallel to the substrate and between the edge of each contact and the
mesa wall. Methods of reducing such losses include the use of wafer fabrication techniques 
such as self-aligned metalization and tightened manufacturing tolerances to reduce the area
between the contacts parallel to the substrate. Such wafer fabrication techniques may result in
other problems such as increased reliability problems and difficulty in manufacturing. In
addition, wafer fabrication techniques do not significantly reduce losses, since 3-D optical
ray trace modeling of high index gel-encapsulated, III-nitride LED structures grown on
sapphire shows that, of the light undesirably extracted from the LED chip in this direction,
the majority is lost through the mesa wall rather than from any surface of the epitaxial
material which runs parallel to the substrate surface on which the epitaxial semiconductor
was grown. The light extracted at the mesa wall is on the order of 15% of the light generated
within the LED, the exact figure depending on, among other factors, the mesa wall height and
angle.</p>
    <p num="0006">Accordingly, an LED structure that minimizes optical loss at the mesa wall is
needed.</p>
    <p num="0007">In accordance with the invention, a step in index of refraction is created at the
mesa wall of a III-nitride flip chip light emitting device. The step in index of refraction
reflects much of the light incident on the mesa wall back into the device where it can be
usefully extracted. In some embodiments, a solder wall on the submount or a high index gel
or epoxy coating the light emitting device and the submount creates a sealed gap between the
light emitting device and the submount. The gap is filled with a material having a low index
of refraction, such as air, another low index gas, low index flux, or a low index silicone gel or
epoxy. In other embodiments, a high index material covers the substrate of the light emitting
device, and a low index material fills the gap between the submount and the light emitting
device. The high index material may be a silicone gel, epoxy, or a solid high index block, and
the low index material may be a different silicone gel, epoxy, or a low index gas such as air.</p>

    <p num="0019">In accordance with the invention, a large step in refractive index is created at
the mesa wall separating the p-contact and the n-contact. The step in index of refraction is
created by placing a material having a low index of refraction at the mesa wall. As used
herein, "high" index of refraction refers to an index of refraction greater than or equal to the
index of refraction of a material index-matched to sapphire. Sapphire has an index of
refraction of about 1.7 to 1.8, and materials having indices of refraction as low as 1.5 are
considered index-matched to sapphire. In contrast, "low" index of refraction refers to an
index of refraction less than a high index of refraction, e.g. less than about 1.5.</p>
    <p num="0020">The large step in refractive index maximizes the light reflected at the mesa
wall and minimizes the light transmitted through the mesa wall. The light reflected at the
mesa wall can then be usefully extracted through the substrate. Any light transmitted at the
mesa wall is typically lost. In addition to creating a large step in refractive index at the mesa
wall, the size and shape of the mesa wall are selected to maximize light reflection and
minimize light transmission.</p>
    <p num="0021">Fig. 2 illustrates a first embodiment of the invention. An LED flip chip 32 is
mounted epitaxial-layers-down on a submount 34. An n-type layer 51 is deposited on a
substrate 50. An active region 52 is then formed on n-type layer 51, and a p-type layer 53 is
formed on the active region. A portion of p-type layer 53, active region 52, and n-type layer
51 are etched away to expose a portion of n-type layer 51. The etch leaves mesa wall 56,
which allows a p-contact 55 to be connected to p-type layer 53 electrically isolated from n-type
layer 51. An n-contact 54 connects to the n-layer.</p>
    <p num="0022">Fig. 3 illustrates a plan view of the device illustrated in Fig. 2. The n-layer 51
encloses p-layer 53. Both p-layer 53 and n-layer 51 include projections which interpose 
portions of the opposing polarity layer. Returning to Fig. 2, LED 32 is connected to the
submount by solder bumps 38, which connect to p-contact 55, and a solder wall 36 which
connects to n-contact 54. Fig. 4 illustrates the location of solder bumps 38 and solder wall 36
on a submount.</p>
    <p num="0023">When the submount illustrated in Fig. 4 is soldered to the LED illustrated in
Fig. 3, thick solder bumps 38 and solder wall 36 cause a gap 42 to be formed between the
LED and the submount. In the first embodiment of the invention, air, nitrogen, a noble gas,
forming gas, hydrogen, or another gas with a low index of refraction is trapped in gap 42
between the LED and the submount when the LED is mounted on the submount. Forming gas
is a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen often used as a soldering atmosphere. Gasses having
high thermal conductivities, such as hydrogen and helium, may specifically be chosen so as
to improve thermal transfer between the LED die and the submount, thereby improving the
heat-sinking of the LED chip. Solder wall 36 encloses gap 42 and prevents the air or other
low index gas from escaping. The gas fills the space in gap 42, thus the gas is incident on
mesa wall 56. The layers that make up mesa wall 56, i.e. n-layer 51, active layer 52, and p-layer
53 are all GaN-based materials, and therefore have an index of refraction of about 2.4.
In contrast, the air or low index of refraction gas has an index of refraction of about 1. As a
result of the large step in index of refraction at mesa wall 56, most light incident on mesa
wall 56 will be reflected back into the LED towards substrate 32, where it can be extracted in
a useful direction, rather than transmitted into gap 42, where it cannot be extracted in a useful
direction.</p>
    <p num="0024">After the LED is mounted on the submount, trapping air or a low index gas in
gap 42, the device can then be encapsulated in a high index material, as described above.
Solder wall 36 prevents any of the high index gel from contacting mesa wall 56.</p>
    <p num="0025">Mesa wall 56 may also be coated with a dielectric layer such as alumina,
silica, or silicon nitride. Such a structure has a similar result, so long as the dielectric coating
is then incident on air or some other low index material.</p>
    <p num="0026">In another embodiment of the invention, rather than a gas, a low index
material such as a low index flux or a low index silicone gel or epoxy is trapped in gap 42.
Flux is a material used in the process of soldering the LED to the submount. Solder bumps 38
and solder wall 36 may be, for example, an alloy of Pb and Sn. When exposed to air, an
oxide forms on the surface of solder bumps 38 and solder wall 36. Flux is applied to dissolve
the oxide formed on the solder. In this embodiment, a quantity of low index flux, low index
silicone or other gel, or low index epoxy is trapped in gap 42, and prevented from escaping 
by solder wall 36. Solder wall 36 also prevents the high index material encapsulating the
device from contaminating the low index material in gap 42.</p>
    <p num="0027">Fig. 5 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention. In this
embodiment, no solder wall 36 isolates mesa wall 56 from the outside of the device. The n-contacts
are connected to the submount by solder bumps 38, similar to the solder bumps
connecting the p-contacts to the submount. In this embodiment, the space between the
submount and the LED, up to around the layer of epitaxial material adjacent to the substrate,
is filled with a low index gel or low index epoxy 60. The low index gel or epoxy suppresses
light extraction at the mesa wall towards the submount. The remainder of the device, i.e. the
substrate, is encapsulated in a high index gel or high index epoxy 62, which maximizes light
extraction from the substrate. The high index gel or epoxy 62 and low index gel or epoxy 60
are selected so that they are viscous enough not to mix at the interface 61 between the low
index and high index gels or epoxies. Alternatively, the low-index gel or epoxy may be cured
to a viscous or hardened state prior to application of the high-index gel or epoxy, thereby
reducing the likelihood of intermixing of the low- and high-index materials at the interface
between the two materials. In another embodiment, the entire device may be encapsulated in
a single high index gel or epoxy, but the epitaxial side of LED is coated with a material
which causes the high index gel or epoxy to react to form a low index material adjacent the
lower, epitaxial side of the device.</p>
    <p num="0028">Fig. 6 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention. After being
mounted on the submount, the LED 32 is attached to a high index block 64 of solid material.
High index block 64 is index-matched to the substrate of LED 32, and thereby maximizes
light extraction from the substrate. High index block 64 replaces the high index gel typically
encapsulating the LED mounted on the submount. High index block 64 may be shaped so as
to further enhance light extraction from the assembly. Since high index block 64 is solid, it
does not contact mesa wall 56. LED 32 can therefore be mounted on a submount such that
mesa wall 56 is incident on air, thus minimizing light extracted at mesa wall 56. High index
block 64 may be, for example, oxides of aluminum, tungsten, hafnium, yttrium, and cerium;
flourides of cerium, lanthanum, and neodium; high index glass; or zirconia if the LED is
formed on a sapphire substrate. High index block 64 may be, for example, zinc sulfide, III-nitride
materials, SiC, ZnSe and oxides of titanium, zirconium, manganese, chromium,
niobium, indium, tin, tantalum, and antimony if the LED is formed on a SiC substrate. High
index block 64 may be, for example, zinc sulfide, III-nitride materials, SiC, ZnSe and oxides 
of titanium, zirconium, manganese, chromium, niobium, indium, tin, tantalum, and antimony
if the LED is formed on a III-nitride substrate.</p>
    <p num="0029">Fig. 7 illustrates another embodiment of the present invention, where the high
index gel used to encapsulate the device is extremely viscous. In this embodiment, the high
index material 70 is too viscous to fill the area between LED 32 and submount 34. The
viscous high index material 70 forms wall 74 between LED 32 and submount 34, which traps
a pocket 72 of air or another low index material between LED 32 and submount 34. As a
result, mesa wall 56 is incident on a low index material, thus minimizing the extraction of
light at the mesa wall.</p>
    <p num="0030">Figs. 8A-8C illustrate still another embodiment of the present invention. A low
index material is applied to the mesa wall using dry film technology. Such dry films are
available with an index of refraction as low as 1.3. Photo-sensitized polypropylene or
polyethylene form appropriate polymer dry-films. In order to form a light emitting structure
with a polymer dry-film low index material on the mesa wall, first a photo-sensitive polymer
dry-film 102 is vacuum-formed onto submount 100. Attached to the submount are solder
bumps 108 which are used to attach the LED to the submount. The photo-sensitive polymer
film 102 is then patterned to remove the film covering the solder bumps, as illustrated in Fig.
8B. The photo-sensitive polymer film may be patterned by, for example, applying a
photomask over the film and exposing the photomask to dissolve away in a developer
solution those portions of the film covering solder bumps 108. The film may also be
patterned by laser ablation or by patterning the film using standard photoresist, solvents,
and/or etchants.</p>
    <p num="0031">The LED chip 106 is then located over solder bumps 108 and remaining island
of dry-film polymer 102, as illustrated in Fig. 8C. The LED and submount are then heated to
fuse the solder 108 to the soldering pads 110 of LED 106. In the process, the polymer dry-film
102 also softens and flows, contacting the LED surface and wetting to the mesa wall.
The polymer dry-film 102 also wets to the submount wafer 100, forming an impervious layer
joining the LED chip to the submount wafer and flowing around the solder connects.</p>
    <p num="0032">The film is also chosen so as to serve as a solder mask so that closer spacing
between the solder bumps may be obtained than is possible without polymer dry-film; the
presence of the mask reduces the probability of solder bridging between adjacent solder
bumps.</p>
    <p num="0033">The structures described in Figs. 2-8C may offer several advantages. Each
structure creates a large step in index of refraction at the mesa wall, thus each structure 
improves useful light extraction in the device. In addition, the structures described above are
simple and inexpensive to fabricate, and typically involve little or no additional
semiconductor processing.</p>
    <p num="0034">The size and shape of mesa wall 56 can be selected to maximize reflection of
rays incident on the mesa wall. Fig. 9 illustrates the mesa in more detail. The inclination of
the mesa wall, µ, determines the angle of incidence of a reflected ray on the GaN-substrate
interface. The angle of incidence is π. In order to maximize the probability of extraction of
this ray, π must be as small as possible, and smaller than the critical angle for total internal
reflection at the GaN-substrate interface.</p>
    <p num="0035">Fig. 10 illustrates the extracted light as a function of mesa wall angle for a
device where the mesa wall is incident on a high index material, and for a device according to
the present invention where the mesa wall is incident on air. Fig. 10 illustrates that
considerable enhancement of useful light extraction from the chip can be achieved by
selecting a structure having an optimal mesa wall angle. The optimal value of mesa wall
angle is dependent on the exact device structure. The triangles illustrate a device with a mesa
wall incident on air and the diamonds illustrate a device with a mesa wall incident on a high
index epoxy. For a device with a mesa wall incident on air, a mesa wall angle between 35 and
65 degrees is optimal for useful light extraction from the chip, and the devices with the best
useful light extraction have a mesa wall angle between 45 and 55 degrees. The mesa wall
angle is controlled by tailoring the dry-etch process by which the mesa is defined.
Alternatively, an appropriate crystallographic etch could also selectively etch a mesa wall
with a particular angle.</p>
    <p num="0036">The optimal height of the mesa wall is also dependent on the structure of the
LED chip. Fig. 11 illustrates the useful light output as a function of mesa wall height for
several devices. The diamonds illustrate a device with a mesa wall incident on air, the small
squares illustrate a device with a mesa wall incident on a material with an index of refraction
of 1.5, the triangles illustrate a device with a mesa wall incident on a material with an index
of refraction of 1.57, and the large squares illustrate a device with a mesa wall incident on a
material having an index of refraction of 1.764. For a chip having an optimally angled mesa
wall incident on a low index material, a chip having a taller mesa has higher useful light
extraction. This is because if the mesa wall is highly reflecting, light reflected from the mesa
wall escapes the device quickly without attenuation. However, if the mesa wall is incident on
a material having a high refractive index, illustrated by the squares, useful light extraction
decreases as the mesa height is increased due to increased light extraction through the mesa 
wall. The mesa height is controlled by controlling the depth of the etch into the n-type GaN
layer. After etching, enough n-type GaN must remain for formation of a reliable, low
resistance n-contact.</p>
    <p num="0037">While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and
described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be
made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended
claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as fall within
the true spirit and scope of this invention. For example, the invention is not limited to a GaN-based
device as described above.</p>
