    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a brush seal
device for performing sealing by means of a brush seal
that separates high-pressure and low-pressure sides
between component members that are opposed to each other.
In particular, the present invention relates to an
assembly-type brush seal device that allows enlargement
through combination of split-body parts and that can be
assembled with or removed from a shaft easily.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0002">A brush seal device 100 shown in Fig. 15 is based
on an art related to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="0003">Fig. 15 is a cross-sectional view of a brush seal
device 100 mounted in a fitting portion between a casing
120 and a rotational shaft 130, for example, of a steam
turbine. Fig. 16 is a plan view of the inner periphery
of a connecting portion of the brush seal device shown
in Fig. 15.</p>
    <p num="0004">In Figs. 15 and 16, when the brush seal device 100
is installed between bearings of the steam turbine,
brush seal split parts 101, into which the brush seal
device 100 is divided, are connected to one another and 
assembled into an annular body surrounding the
rotational shaft 130, without removing the rotational
shaft 130 or the bearings. Each of the brush seal split
parts 101 has connecting portions at its opposed ends
and is connected at the connecting portions to adjacent
ones of the brush seal split parts 101.</p>
    <p num="0005">Even in the case where the rotational shaft 130
has a large diameter, since the brush seal device 100 is
designed as a split type, sequential assembly of the
brush seal split parts 101 makes it unnecessary for a
large number of operators to perform the assembling
operation while hoisting a bulky annular brush seal
device by means of a crane or the like.</p>
    <p num="0006">The brush seal device 100 is mounted in a mounting
groove 121 formed in the casing 120. The brush seal
device 100 is pressed inwards in a springy manner from
the outer periphery side by a leaf spring (not shown).
Therefore, a space portion 122 exists between the outer
peripheral surface of the brush seal device 100 and the
surface in which the mounting groove 121 is formed.</p>
    <p num="0007">A multitude of bristles 103 are disposed in a wall
shape along the inner periphery of the brush seal device
100 as shown in Fig. 17, which illustrates another
related art. The outer periphery of a brush seal 102
composed of the bristles 103 is mounted to a mounting 
portion 104. The brush seal 102 is disposed slantingly
and is designed to be opposed to a rotational shaft (not
shown).</p>
    <p num="0008">The mounting portion 104 of the brush seal 102 is
fixed to a back plate 105. The brush seal 102 is
designed, in a region ranging from the mounting portion
104 to its free end, to be supported by the back plate
105 and not to be deformed substantially even if sealed
fluid acts thereon from the side of a pressure P1. A
holding plate 107 fixes the mounting portion 104 of the
brush seal 102 together with the back plate 105 by
welding. As shown in Fig. 16, the brush seal split
parts thus constructed are arranged in the
circumferential direction at intervals of one-sixth of
the circumference.</p>
    <p num="0009">Each of these brush seal split parts is in the
shape of an arc and has splitting surfaces 110 at its
opposed ends. Each of the splitting surfaces 110 of
each of the brush seal split parts is connected to the
splitting surface 110 of another corresponding one of
the brush seal split parts, so that an integral-type
annular body is formed. Each of the splitting surfaces
110 is composed of axial surfaces 111 and a radial
surface 112 and thus assumes a step-like structure.</p>
    <p num="0010">When these brush seal split parts are in a mounted 
state, the splitting surfaces 110 are joined to one
another. However, as shown in Fig.16, the axial surface
111 of the brush seal device 100 allows a narrow gap C1
to be created due to an operational force resulting from
oscillation of the rotational shaft 130 or the like. In
such a case, sealed fluid on the side of the high
pressure P1 flows through the gap C1 on the side of the
high pressure P1, reaches the space portion 122, flows
through a gap C2 on the side of a low pressure P2, and
leaks out to the side of the low pressure P2.</p>
    <p num="0011">Fig. 17 shows the brush seal device according to
another related art. Fig. 17 is a side view of a
connecting portion 109 of the brush seal device 100.
Fig. 18 is a plan view of the brush seal device 100
shown in Fig. 17 as viewed from its inner-diameter side
in the direction of an inclining gap C3.</p>
    <p num="0012">The brush seal device 100 shown in Fig. 17 has the
splitting surfaces 110 that are formed in the connecting
portion 109 in such a manner as to incline with respect
to the radial direction. Even in the case of the
splitting surfaces 110, if adjacent ones of the brush
seal split parts are displaced in opposite directions,
the gap C3 is widened. Then, sealed fluid leaks out
from the gap C3.</p>
    <p num="0013">In the related arts described above, the gap C 
between the splitting surfaces 110 is widened if the
operational force of the rotational shaft 130 or the
pressure P1 of sealed fluid is directly applied to the
brush seal device 100. Thus, sealed fluid leaks out to
the side of the low pressure P2 through the gap C. In
particular, if the brush seal device 100 wobbles during
rotation as a result of oscillating or swaying movements
of the rotational shaft 130, the rotational shaft 130
comes into tight contact with the brush seal device 100.
When the rotational shaft 130 is in contact with the
brush seal device 100, the former applies an operational
force to the latter. This operational force widens the
gap between the splitting surfaces 110, 110. As a
result, the sealing performance deteriorates to such an
extent that sealed fluid leaks out from the gap between
the splitting surfaces 110, 110. Therefore,
deterioration of the ability to seal the gap between the
splitting surfaces 110 looms as a serious problem.</p>
    <p num="0014">Although the split-type brush seal device 100 is
most preferably designed to be held in a springy manner
from the outer peripheral side by a leaf spring or the
like so as to counterbalance the effect of oscillation
of the rotational shaft 130 or the like, the problem of
leakage of sealed fluid from the gap C between the
splitting surfaces 110, 110 makes it difficult to adopt 
such a construction in an effective way. Consequently,
a large operational force that may be applied to the
brush seal 102 from the rotational shaft 130 causes a
problem of abrasion of the brush seal 102 at an early
stage of its use.</p>
    <p num="0015">The present invention has been made as
countermeasures against the problems as described above.
One technical aim of the present invention as a solution
to the problems is to prevent leakage of sealed fluid
through a gap between splitting surfaces of adjacent
ones of brush seal split parts even if the gap has been
widened.</p>
    <p num="0016">Another technical aim of the present invention is
to allow adoption of an excellent mechanism for
preventing abrasion of bristles not only by the elastic
force of the brush seal but also through elastic
enlargement or reduction of the diameter of the brush
seal split parts constituting an annular body.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0017">The present invention has been made as a solution
to the aforementioned problems. Means for achieving the
technical aims are constructed as follows.</p>
    <p num="0018">In a brush seal device according to a first
preferred embodiment of the present invention, splitting 
surfaces of a plurality of split-body parts are combined
with one another. The brush seal device is mounted to
one of opposed component members so as to seal a gap
between the component members. This brush seal device
comprises a brush seal and the split-body parts. The
brush seal is formed in a wall shape in the longitudinal
direction of a fixture portion which is fixed at one end
thereof. The split-body parts hold the brush seal.
Each of the split-body parts has connecting portions
that are split and that extend along splitting surfaces.
Each of the splitting surfaces is composed of splitting
direction-extending surfaces that extend in such a
direction as to split the split-body parts and a
longitudinal surface that extends in the longitudinal
direction of the split-body parts and that forms a step
interposed between the splitting direction-extending
surfaces. Each of the splitting direction-extending
surfaces has shutoff means for sealing a gap between the
splitting direction-extending surfaces that are combined
with each other.</p>
    <p num="0019">In the brush seal device according to the first
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
shutoff means for sealing sealed fluid is disposed
between the splitting direction-extending surfaces.
Therefore, even if the other of the component members, 
for example, the rotational shaft wobbles during
rotation and comes into tight contact with the brush
seal, leakage of sealed fluid from the gap between the
splitting surfaces is prevented effectively.</p>
    <p num="0020">In addition, the brush seal device of the present
invention prevents leakage of sealed fluid from the gap
between the splitting surfaces by means of the shutoff
means even if a gap has been created between the
splitting surfaces. Therefore, even if a pressing force
resulting from, for example, oscillation of the
rotational shaft or the like is applied to the brush
seal device that is held in a springy manner from the
outer peripheral side by a spring or the like, the brush
seal device makes it possible to deform the brush seal
and effectively increase or reduce the inner diameter of
the brush seal in accordance with the pressing force.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="0039">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention
will be described in detail with reference to the 
drawings.</p>
    <p num="0040">Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a brush seal
device 1 according to a first embodiment of the present
invention. The brush seal device 1 is mounted in a
mounting groove 51 of one of two component members, that
is, a casing 50. The brush seal device 1 is disposed at
a position opposite the other component member, that is,
a rotational shaft 60.</p>
    <p num="0041">Splitting direction-extending surfaces 3D shown in
Fig. 3 extend in the radial direction of the brush seal
device 1 according to the side view shown in Fig. 1. A
plan view of the brush seal device 1 as viewed from its
inner-diameter side is generally as shown in Fig. 4.</p>
    <p num="0042">In the brush seal device 1 shown in Fig. 1, a
fixture portion 6 of a brush seal 5 is clamped between a
back plate portion 2A and a holding plate portion 2B and
integrated therewith by welding. This brush seal device
1 is composed of six split-body parts 2 that are
arranged in the circumferential direction at equal
intervals. The brush seal device 1 may be
circumferentially divided into two, four, six, or any
suitable number of split-body parts 2 that are
equivalent in size.</p>
    <p num="0043">The brush seal 5 has a multitude of bristles 7
that are arranged in the circumferential direction, 
stacked on one another, and formed in a wall shape. The
bristles 7 constituting the brush seal 5 are fixed to
the fixture portion 6 while inclining with respect to
the radial direction by a certain angle.</p>
    <p num="0044">The fixture portion 6 of the brush seal 5 is
integrated with the back plate portion 2A. A supporting
surface 8 of the back plate portion 2A supports the
brush seal 5 so that the brush seal 5 can be sealed
without being deformed drastically even if sealed fluid
has acted thereon.</p>
    <p num="0045">The holding plate portion 2B, which is integrated
with the back plate portion 2A, is fixed to the back
plate portion 2A in an integral manner while clamping
the fixture portion 6 of the brush seal 5. This fixture
method accomplishes integration on the basis of welding
according to various welding methods. A recess portion
9 is formed in the holding plate portion 2B in such a
manner as to define a space portion 13 between the brush
seal 5 and a corresponding face of the holding plate
portion 2B that is located opposite the brush seal 5, so
that sealed fluid can act on the brush seal 5.</p>
    <p num="0046">The back plate portion 2A and the holding plate
portion 2B are fixed to each other by welding while the
fixture portion 6 of the brush seal 5 is interposed
therebetween. The split-body parts 2 are arranged in 
the circumferential direction at equal intervals.</p>
    <p num="0047">The split-body parts 2, which include the back
plate portion 2A and the holding plate portion 2B, are
made from a nickel-based alloy. The materials contained
in this alloy are selected from iron, steel, non-ferrous
alloy, and the like, and differ depending on the
conditions imposed by the field to which the present
invention is applied. These conditions include the type
of sealed fluid, the temperature, and the like. It is
also required that these materials be selected in
accordance with the linear expansion coefficient of the
casing 50.</p>
    <p num="0048">Furthermore, the bristles 7 constituting the brush
seal 5 are made from copper wires, nickel-based alloy
wires, ceramic wires, or the like. As an example, the
bristles 7 have a diameter of 0.05 to 0.5mm. The
bristles 7 have a length of 5 to 50mm. The stacked
bristles 7 have a wall thickness of 0.5 to 4mm.</p>
    <p num="0049">If need be, these numerical ranges can be changed
depending on the applied conditions.</p>
    <p num="0050">As described above, the split-body parts 2 are
arranged in the circumferential direction at equal
intervals. In other words, if the split-body parts 2
are connected to one another with a splitting surface 3
of a connecting portion 4 of each of the split-body 
parts 2 connected to an adjacent splitting surface 3 of
a connecting portion 4 of an adjacent one of the split-body
parts 2, an annular body is formed.</p>
    <p num="0051">As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, each connecting portion
4 having a splitting surface 3 as its end surface is
formed so that the split-body parts 2 can be connected
to one another. Each splitting surface 3 is composed of
two splitting direction-extending surfaces 3D and a
longitudinal surface 3L. The splitting direction-extending
surfaces 3D extend in the radial direction of
the annular body. The longitudinal surface 3L extends
in the longitudinal direction of the split-body parts 2,
that is, in the circumferential direction of the annular
body. Thus, the splitting surface 3 has a step-like
structure.</p>
    <p num="0052">The step-like portion of the splitting surface 3
shown in Fig. 1 extends in the radial direction in the
side view of Fig. 3.</p>
    <p num="0053">The step-like splitting surface 3 of each of the
split-body parts 2 is connected to the step-like
splitting surface 3 of an adjacent one of the split-body
parts 2, so that the split-body parts 2 assume an
annular shape as a whole. Thus, the split-body parts 2
are assembled into the brush seal device 1.</p>
    <p num="0054">After the brush seal device 1 has been fitted to 
the casing 50, the longitudinal surfaces 3L, 3L of the
splitting surface 3 are formed in a first joining
portion 20A such that they remain connected while being
in sliding contact with each other regardless of whether
the diameter of the brush seal device 1 is increased or
reduced. Even if a gap C is created between two
adjacent splitting direction-extending surfaces 3D, the
first joining portion 20A remains in a state of being
sealed in contact. Therefore, leakage of sealed fluid
from the first joining portion 20A is prevented. In the
brush seal device 1, the step-like portion of each of
the splitting direction-extending surfaces 3D is
provided with contact surfaces 3D1, 3D1 that are in
contact with each other. The contact surfaces 3D1, 3D1
form shutoff joining portions 10D and constitute a
shutoff means 10. The longitudinal dimension of these
contact surfaces 3D1, 3D1, that is, the shutoff joining
portions 10D is equal to the circumferential length.
Therefore, the state of being sealed in contact is
maintained due to the width of contact, which is equal
to the longitudinal dimension even if the diameter of
the brush seal device 1 is increased.</p>
    <p num="0055">Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the brush seal
device 1 according to the second example of the present
invention, as viewed in the direction indicated by 
arrows A, A in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 is a side view of Fig. 2.
Fig. 4 is a plan view of both connecting portions 4
shown in Fig. 3, as viewed from their inner-periphery
side. It is to be noted herein that dimensions x, y
shown in Fig. 2 correspond to dimensions x, y shown in
Fig. 3 respectively.</p>
    <p num="0056">The brush seal device 1 shown in Fig. 2 is
different from the brush seal device 1 shown in Fig. 1
especially in the fixture portion 6 of the brush seal 5.
The fixture portion 6 of the brush seal 5 of the brush
seal device 1 shown in Fig. 2 has a rectangular cross-sectional
shape. The entire lateral face shown in Fig.
3 is in the shape of an arc having a length
corresponding to the length of the split-body parts 2.
The brush seal 5 and the fixture portion 6 are connected
to each other by high-precision welding with the aid of
a welder. The fixture portion 6 of the brush seal 5 is
securely clamped on its opposed sides while being
securely fitted to a fitting portion 12 where the back
plate portion 2A and the holding plate portion 2B are
fitted together. These three component members, namely,
the fixture portion 6 of the brush seal 5, the back
plate portion 2A, and the holding plate portion 2B serve
to constitute a corresponding one of the split-body
parts 2. </p>
    <p num="0057">As shown in Fig. 3, the splitting surface 3 of the
brush seal device 1 shown in Fig. 2 inclines with
respect to the radial direction of the split-body parts
2. Each pair of the splitting direction-extending
surfaces 3D shown in Figs. 3 and 4 has the narrow gap C
formed therebetween. In the first joining portion 20A,
however, the longitudinal surfaces 3L, 3L are in close
contact with each other so as to seal in the sealed
fluid. Although the description of other structural
details is omitted herein, the brush seal device 1 shown
in Fig. 2 is constructed substantially in the same
manner as shown in Fig. 1.</p>
    <p num="0058">Referring to Fig. 3, a rubber-like sealing plate
10T made from a super-elastic alloy is provided in each
of the first joining portion 20A and the shutoff joining
portions 10D. This construction is based on the third
example of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="0059">It is indispensable that the shutoff joining
portions 10D be provided with the rubber-like sealing
plate 10T. The shutoff means 10 is constructed by
providing the shutoff joining portions 10D with a
rubber-like sealing plate 20T.</p>
    <p num="0060">It is preferable that this super-elastic alloy be
Cu-Al-Ni alloy. Besides, Ni-Ti alloy, Cu-Zn alloy, and
the like are also appropriate. The super-elastic alloy 
is manufactured by quenching following a thermal
treatment that lasts for about two hours at 1000°C. The
super-elastic alloy exhibits an elastic strain limit of
20%.</p>
    <p num="0061">Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the brush seal
device 1 according to the fourth example of the present
invention, as viewed in the direction indicated by
arrows A, A in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 is a side view of Fig. 5.
Fig. 7 is a plan view of both the connecting portions 4
as viewed from the inner-diameter side in Fig. 5. Fig.
8 is a side view of the first example corresponding to
the shutoff means 10 shown in Fig. 6, showing a state
where the gap C has been narrowed. Fig. 9 is a side
view showing how an elastic sealing plate 10B according
to the second embodiment is deformed in a state where
the gap C shown in Fig. 8 has been widened. The
longitudinal dimension shown in Fig. 5 is marked with z
so as to indicate that it is equal to the dimension z
shown in Fig. 6.</p>
    <p num="0062">The brush seal device 1 shown in Fig. 5 is
constructed substantially in the same manner except for
the connecting portions shown in Fig. 2.</p>
    <p num="0063">The splitting surface 3 shown in Fig. 5 is
different from the one shown in Fig. 3. That is, the
splitting surface 3 shown in Fig. 5 extends straight in 
an inclined state. The elastic sealing plate 10B is
provided in such a manner as to extend across the gap C
formed between the splitting direction-extending
surfaces 3D, 3D on the side of a high pressure P1. The
elastic sealing plate 10B constitutes the shutoff means
10.</p>
    <p num="0064">The front-end side of the elastic sealing plate
10B is bent toward sealed fluid in an elastically
deformable manner. The root side of the elastic sealing
plate 10B is securely fitted into and thus mounted to a
slit 18 formed in the holding plate portion 2B. The
free-end side of the elastic sealing plate 10B extends
across the gap C and is in close contact with the
splitting direction-extending surface 3D. The front-end
side of the free-end portion of the elastic sealing
plate 10B is in contact with the splitting direction-extending
surface 3D while being in an elastically
deformed state. The front-end side of the free-end
portion of the elastic sealing plate 10B moves in
response to a possible change in the gap C and performs
the function of sealing. Instead of being securely
fitted into the slit 18, the root side of the elastic
sealing plate 10B may be mounted thereto according to a
different method such as welding, soldering, adhesion,
caulking, or the like. </p>
    <p num="0065">Fig. 6 shows an example in which the gap C is open
to a normal extent. Fig. 7 is a plan view of the
connecting portions 4 shown in Fig. 6, as viewed from
their inner-diameter side. The gap C is designed to
change during operation so as to effectively prevent the
brush seal 5 from coming into press-contact with a
rotational shaft 60 and being abraded.</p>
    <p num="0066">Fig. 8 shows the elastic sealing plate 10B
according to the first embodiment. The elastic sealing
plate 10B shown in Fig. 8 constitutes the shutoff means
10 shown in Fig. 6.</p>
    <p num="0067">Referring to Figs. 8 and 9, the lower root side of
the elastic sealing plate 10B assumes the shape of a
chamfered arc R or a slanting arc K so as to cope with
the case where the gap shown in Fig. 6 has been narrowed.
Fig. 8 shows, as an example occurring during operation,
a state where the gap C has been narrowed in comparison
with the gap C shown in Fig. 6.</p>
    <p num="0068">Contrary to Fig. 8, Fig. 9 shows a state where the
gap C has been widened during operation. Figs. 8 and 9
both show how the elastic sealing plate 10B is
elastically deformed in response to a dimensional change
of the gap C, shuts the gap C off, and seals fluid.</p>
    <p num="0069">Fig. 10 is a cross-sectional view of the brush
seal device 1 according to the fifth example of the 
present invention. Fig. 11 is a side view of the
connecting portions 4 shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 12 is a
plan view of both the connecting portions 4 shown in Fig.
10, as viewed from their inner-diameter sides. Fig. 13
is a side view of the shutoff means 10 according to the
first embodiment of the present invention, which
corresponds to the shutoff means 10 shown in Fig. 11.
Fig. 14 is a side view of the shutoff means 10 according
to the second embodiment of the present invention, which
corresponds to the shutoff means 10 shown in Fig. 11.</p>
    <p num="0070">In the brush seal device 1 shown in Fig. 10, a
first elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion
10C1 having a C-shaped cross-section corresponds to the
shutoff means 10, which is the elastic sealing plate 10B
shown in Fig. 6. The first elastically deformable
plate-type sealing portion 10C1 is a concrete example of
the elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion
10C. The first elastically deformable plate-type
sealing portion 10C1 is disposed in a fitting groove 14
formed in the splitting direction-extending surface 3D
in one of the split-body parts 2, thus constituting the
shutoff means 10.</p>
    <p num="0071">The side of a C-shaped opening 11 of the first
elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion 10C1
is disposed facing the side where sealed fluid enters. 
The inner space of the first elastically deformable
plate-type sealing portion 10C1 is radially enlarged due
to the pressure of sealed fluid, so that the contact
surface pressure is increased to the extent of making it
possible to perform the function of sealing.</p>
    <p num="0072">Because the first elastically deformable plate-type
sealing portion 10C1 has a C-shaped cross-section,
it is elastically deformed to a great extent. Thus, the
first elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion
10C1 can seal the gap C effectively in accordance with
the change in the opening of the gap C.</p>
    <p num="0073">Fig. 12 shows the width of each of the gaps C in
the splitting direction-extending surface 3, as viewed
from the inner-periphery side in Fig. 11. The
longitudinal surfaces 3L, 3L are in contact with each
other and constitute the first joining portion 20A. The
first connecting portion is formed in the longitudinal
direction. Therefore, even if the first connecting
portion is displaced longitudinally, it can constantly
maintain a state of contact and shut the gap C off.</p>
    <p num="0074">A second elastically deformable plate-type sealing
portion 10C2 having an O-shaped cross-section as shown
in Fig. 13 is the first embodiment of the elastically
deformable plate-type sealing portion 10C constituting
the shutoff means 10. The second elastically deformable 
plate-type sealing portion 10C2 is disposed in the
fitting groove 14 that is equivalent to the fitting
groove 14 shown in Fig. 11.</p>
    <p num="0075">Although the second elastically deformable plate-type
sealing portion 10C has an O-shaped cross-section,
it has a small thickness. Therefore, the second
elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion 10C
can be elastically deformed and strictly follow
dimensional changes of the gap C.</p>
    <p num="0076">In particular, it is preferable that the second
elastically deformable sealing portion 10C2 be made from
an axially open spring steel pipe, a stainless pipe, or
the like. It is more preferable that the second
elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion 10C2
be made from a super-elastic alloy.</p>
    <p num="0077">Fig. 14 shows a third elastically deformable
plate-type sealing portion 10C3 having a W-shaped cross-section.
The third elastically deformable plate-type
sealing portion 10C3 is the second embodiment of the
elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion 10C
constituting the shutoff means 10. As in the case of
the first elastically deformable plate-type sealing
portion 10C1 shown in Fig. 11, the third elastically
deformable plate-type sealing portion 10C3 is also
disposed in the fitting groove 14. Because the third 
elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion 10C3
has a W-shaped cross-section, it can be elastically
deformed to a great extent and can cope with an increase
or decrease in dimension of the gap C.</p>
    <p num="0078">It is preferable that the elastically deformable
plate-type sealing portion 10C described above be made
from a spring steel plate or a stainless plate. It is
more preferable that the elastically deformable plate-type
sealing portion 10C be made from a super-elastic
alloy plate or the like. A plate made from a selected
one of these materials is processed and formed into an
elastically deformable plate. For instance, this
elastically deformable plate has a cross-section in the
shape of O, C, V, W, X, D, or S.</p>
    <p num="0079">Hereinafter, other preferred embodiments of the
present invention will be described.</p>
    <p num="0080">In the brush seal device according to the second
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
shutoff means has longitudinal contact surfaces formed
in a step-like structure of the splitting direction-extending
surfaces, and is constructed in a joining
portion where the contact surfaces are joined with each
other.</p>
    <p num="0081">This brush seal device of the present invention is
designed to cause only sliding movements in the 
direction of travel of the connecting portions and
maintain a state of contact of the contact surfaces even
if the connecting portions serving as the shutoff means
have been displaced longitudinally in such a manner as
to increase or reduce the dimension between the
splitting direction-extending surfaces. Thus, it
becomes possible to seal the gap between the splitting
direction-extending surfaces. Accordingly, the
construction of the second embodiment makes it possible
to enlarge the extent to which the diameter of the brush
seal device is increased or reduced.</p>
    <p num="0082">In the brush seal device according to the third
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
shutoff means has the sealing plate made from a super-elastic
alloy material on the contact surfaces.</p>
    <p num="0083">In this brush seal device of the present invention,
since the rubber-like super-elastic alloy is interposed
between the contact surfaces, the state of contact of
the connecting portions serving as the shutoff means
makes it possible to seal in sealed fluid reliably.
This alloy is heat-resistant and thus can also be used
at high temperatures.</p>
    <p num="0084">In the brush seal device according to the fourth
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
shutoff means is composed of the elastic sealing plate 
extending across and shutting off the gap between the
splitting direction-extending surfaces that are opposed
to each other.</p>
    <p num="0085">This brush seal device of the present invention is
designed such that the shutoff means is composed of the
elastic sealing plate and that the free-end face of the
elastic sealing plate extends across the gap between the
splitting direction-extending surfaces, elastically
comes into contact with them, and seal the gap.
Therefore, the gap between the splitting direction-extending
surfaces can be sealed reliably. For example,
the free-end face of the elastic sealing plate can even
follow enlargement of the diameter corresponding to the
pressing force of the rotational shaft and still seal
the gap. That is, it becomes possible to quickly cope
with the increase or decrease in diameter resulting from
fluctuations of the rotational shaft and seal the gap.</p>
    <p num="0086">In the brush seal device according to the fifth
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
shutoff means is composed of the elastically deformable
plate-type sealing portion that is disposed between the
splitting direction-extending surfaces so as to shut off
the gap therebetween and that is joined with the
splitting direction-extending surfaces.</p>
    <p num="0087">In this brush seal device of the present invention, 
the shutoff means is constructed of the elastically
deformable plate-type sealing portion. Therefore, this
brush seal device achieves a press-contact state
reliably and performs the function of sealing. At the
same time, this brush seal device returns to its
original shape in response to a drop in pressure and
still makes it possible to perform the function of
sealing. If the pressure of sealed fluid is applied to
the elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion,
the elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion
cooperates with the pressure and performs the function
of sealing.</p>
    <p num="0088">The brush seal device according to the present
invention achieves the following effects.</p>
    <p num="0089">In the brush seal device according to the
preferred first embodiment of the present invention,
each of the connecting portions at the opposed ends of
each of the split-body parts is provided with the step-like
splitting surface, which is composed of the
splitting direction-extending surfaces and the
longitudinal surface. Even if the gap between the
splitting direction-extending surfaces is widened, for
example, in the case where the inner diameter of the
brush seal device has been increased, the shutoff means
that constantly performs the function of sealing seals 
and shuts off the passage that is formed of the gap and
the casing to which the brush seal device is mounted,
irrespective of the width of the gap.</p>
    <p num="0090">The construction allowing the shutoff means to
constantly seal the gap between the splitting surfaces
of the split-body parts irrespective of the dimensional
change of the gap makes it possible to realize a design
in which the diameter of each of the split-body parts
can be increased in accordance with the pressing force
that may be applied to the brush seal as a result of
oscillation of the rotational shaft. Therefore, the
effects of minimizing friction of the brush seal and
preventing abrasion of the brush seal can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="0091">In the brush seal device according to the
preferred second embodiment of the present invention,
the splitting direction-extending surfaces have the
contact surfaces that constitute the step-like portions
and that extend longitudinally. The contact surfaces
are connected to each other and constitute the shutoff
joining portions for shutting the gap off. Also, even
if the gap between the splitting direction-extending
surfaces is widened, the shutoff joining portions slide
with respect to each other along the width of the gap
between the splitting direction-extending surfaces.
Therefore, the gap can be sealed constantly. The 
shutoff means is constructed in this manner. For
example, in the case where the brush seal device
constructed by connecting the split-body parts is
designed such that the inner diameter of the brush seal
can be increased or reduced, even if oscillation of the
rotational shaft causes enlargement of the inner
diameter to the extent of widening the gap, the shutoff
joining portions can be constantly held in contact with
each other. Therefore, the effect of constantly
shutting the gap off in accordance with the length of
the contact surfaces constituting the shutoff joining
portions can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="0092">In the brush seal device according to the third
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
longitudinal contact surfaces are provided with the
sealing plate made from the super-elastic alloy as the
shutoff means. Therefore, the sealing plate adheres to
the contact surfaces like a rubber-like elastic body and
achieves the effect of sealing the gap between the
contact surfaces. In particular, the super-elastic
alloy exhibits a rubber-like elastic force and thus
achieves the effect of sealing the gap even if the
contact surfaces undergo slight oscillation or the like.</p>
    <p num="0093">In the brush seal device according to the
preferred fourth embodiment of the present invention, 
the cantilever elastic sealing plate is provided as the
shutoff means. The free-end portion of the cantilever
elastic sealing plate is elastically deformed and is in
contact with the splitting direction-extending surfaces
that are opposed to each other. Therefore, even if the
gap between the splitting direction-extending surfaces
that are opposed to each other is widened, the elastic
deformation follows the dimensional change and ensures a
state of being sealed in contact. Thus, the effect of
constantly shutting off and sealing the gap between the
splitting direction-extending surfaces can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="0094">In the brush seal device according to the
preferred fifth embodiment of the present invention, the
elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion is
provided as the shutoff means. The elastically
deformable plate-type sealing portion, which is mounted
to the fitting groove, tightly adheres to opposed faces
of the splitting direction-extending surfaces and seals
the gap between these surfaces. Therefore, the
elastically deformable plate-type sealing portion
exhibits a great contact force and achieves the effect
of sealing the gap while ensuring a state of contact.</p>
    <p num="0095">The aforementioned preferred embodiments of the
present invention have been described for the purpose of
exemplification. It is obvious that the present 
invention should neither fit in the aspects disclosed
herein nor be limited thereto and that numerous
amendments and modifications are possible in the light
of the teachings of the foregoing description. The
technical scope of the present invention is defined by
