request to a base station control apparatus 130, and
notifies of history of movement of itself and
receives powers of perch channels from base stations
150-2 - 150-4 surrounding the communication partner

    </heading>
    <heading>1. Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a
handover control method, a mobile station and a
communication control apparatus used for the
handover control method in a mobile communication
system including a communication apparatus having a
function of a base station, the mobile station and
the communication control apparatus which controls
connection of communication channels between the
communication apparatus and the mobile station.</p>
    <heading>2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">In a conventional mobile communication
system, the mobile station always receives perch
channels from a base station which is a
communication apparatus with which the mobile
station communicates (base station which is a
transmit/receive partner of user data, such base
station will be called a communication partner) and
base stations surrounding the base station of the
communication partner, and measures received powers
of the perch channels. Then, when a received power
of a perch channel from a surrounding base station
is larger than a received power of the base station
of the communication partner by more than a
predetermined value, the mobile station performs
handover to the surrounding base station according
to control by a base station control apparatus which
is a communication control apparatus which controls
communication channels between the mobile station
and the base station. As a result, the connection
destination is switched. This handover operation is
called hard handover. </p>
    <p num="0003">In a mobile communication system using
code-division multiple access (CDMA), the mobile
station can connect to a plurality of base stations
simultaneously. Thus, being controlled by the base
station control apparatus, the mobile station
releases connection to a base station which is
originally connected after establishing connection
to a base station of a handover destination. This
handover operation is called soft handover. However,
the soft handover is performed in the same way as
the hard handover. That is, in the soft handover,
the mobile station measures received powers of perch
channels sent from the base stations of the
communication partner and the surrounding base
stations. Then, when a received power of a perch
channel from a surrounding base station is larger
than a received power of the base station of the
communication partner by more than a predetermined
value, the mobile station performs handover to the
surrounding base station controlled a base station
control apparatus which is a communication control
apparatus which controls communication channels
between the mobile station and the base station so
that the connection destination is switched.
However, according to the above-mentioned
conventional method, handover is always performed
when the received power of the perch channel from
the surrounding base station is larger by more than
the predetermined value, even when the received
power of the perch channel from the base station of
the communication partner is large enough, that is,
even when handover is unnecessary. Therefore, the
conventional method is not necessarily a good method
from the view point of efficient use of wireless
resources. In addition, there is a problem in that
large load is imposed to the base station control
apparatus which controls the handover and the mobile 
station.</p>
    <p num="0004">In addition, according to the conventional
method, the wireless resource of the base station of
the handover destination is not considered at all.
Therefore, when a request of handover is sent to a
base station, there is a case in which the request
is rejected due to lack of wireless resource so that
communication is disconnected forcefully.</p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0005">An object of the present invention is to
provide a handover control method, a mobile station
and a communication control apparatus in which
unnecessary handover operation is suppressed and
success rate of handover is improved.</p>
    <p num="0006">The above object is achieved by a handover
control method used in a mobile communication system
which includes communication apparatuses having
functions of base stations, a mobile station and a
communication control apparatus which controls
connections between the communication apparatuses
and the mobile station, the handover control method
including the steps of:
<sl><li>the mobile station switching a
communication apparatus of a communication partner
to another communication apparatus when a
communication quality value between the
communication apparatus of the communication partner
and the mobile station falls below a first threshold
which is better than a limitation value by which
communication is available;</li><li>wherein the communication control
apparatus selects at least a handover destination
candidate communication apparatus from among
communication apparatuses surrounding the
communication apparatus of the communication partner
when the communication quality value falls below a 
second threshold which is better than the first
threshold; and</li><li>the communication control apparatus keeps
wireless resources of the at least a handover
destination candidate communication apparatus which
is selected.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0007">According to the handover control method,
handover operation is not performed in the mobile
station even when the received power of the perch
channel from the communication apparatus of the
communication partner falls below a received power
from a communication apparatus surrounding the
communication partner as long as the received power
does not reach limitation by which communication is
available. Thus, according to the present invention,
it does not occur that handover is performed since
the received power from the surrounding base station
is larger than a predetermined value even when the
received power of the perch channel from the base
station is large enough. Thus, unnecessary handover
can be suppressed so that wireless resources can be
used efficiently, and load of the mobile station and
the base station control apparatus which controls
handover can be decreased.</p>
    <p num="0008">When the base station forms a cell as a
communication area, the communication apparatus
means the base station itself. On the other hand,
when the base station forms sectors to which the
cell is divided, the communication apparatus means
an apparatus which includes at least a directional
antenna in a plurality of directional antennas
provided in the base station for forming the sectors
and which communicates with the mobile station.</p>
    <p num="0009">In addition, according to the invention,
since the wireless resources of the communication
apparatus of the handover destination can be kept
before handover is performed, it can be avoided that 
the communication apparatus rejects handover so that
communication is disconnected forcefully. Thus,
success ratio of handover can be increased.</p>
    <p num="0010">The handover control method may include
the steps of:
<sl><li>the communication control apparatus
notifying the mobile station of a handover
destination candidate communication apparatus for
which wireless resources are kept in the at least a
handover destination candidate communication
apparatus; and</li><li>the mobile station switching the
communication apparatus of the communication partner
to the handover destination candidate communication
apparatus which is notified by the communication
control apparatus when the communication quality
value falls below the first threshold.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0011">In addition, the handover control method
may include the steps of:
<sl><li>the mobile station judging whether the
communication quality value falls below the second
threshold, and sending a request for selecting the
at least a handover destination candidate
communication apparatus to the communication control
apparatus when the communication quality value falls
below the second threshold.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0012">According to the invention, since the
mobile station judges whether the communication
quality value falls below the second threshold, it
is not necessary for the communication control,
apparatus to perform such judgment. Thus, load of
the communication control apparatus can be further
decreased.</p>
    <p num="0013">The handover control method may include
the steps of:
<sl><li>when the communication control apparatus
selects a plurality of handover destination 
candidate communication apparatuses, the
communication control apparatus determining
priorities of the plurality of handover destination
candidate communication apparatuses;</li><li>the communication control apparatus
notifying the mobile station of handover destination
candidate communication apparatuses in the plurality
of handover destination candidate communication
apparatuses for which wireless resources are kept
and corresponding priorities;</li><li>the mobile station switching the
communication apparatus of the communication partner
to one of the notified handover destination
candidate communication apparatuses according to the
priorities.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0014">According to the handover control method,
since a plurality of handover destination candidate
communication apparatuses are selected, even when a
request for handover for a communication apparatus
is rejected, other communication apparatus can be
used for the handover destination. Thus, success
ratio of handover can be further improved. In
addition, by assigning priorities for the selected
handover destination candidate communication
apparatuses, the handover destination can be
properly selected.</p>
    <p num="0015">From the viewpoint of properly selecting
the handover destination candidate communication
apparatus on the basis of results of past handover
and improving success ratio of handover, the
handover control method may include the steps of:
<sl><li>the mobile station sending mobile station
information to the communication control apparatus,
the mobile station information including a history
of movement of the mobile station and received
powers of perch channels from communication
apparatuses surrounding the communication apparatus 
of the communication partner;</li><li>the communication control apparatus having
a history of mobile station information, the history
of mobile station information including a history of
movement of the mobile station and received powers
of perch channels from communication apparatuses
surrounding the communication apparatus of the
communication partner for past successful handover;
and</li><li>the communication control apparatus
selecting the at least a handover destination
candidate communication apparatus according to the
mobile station information sent from the mobile
station and the history of mobile station
information for past successful handover.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0016">From the viewpoint of properly assigning
priorities of the selected handover destination
candidate communication apparatuses on the basis of
results of past handover so that success ratio of
handover is improved, the handover control method

      <u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0022">In the following, embodiments of the
present invention will be described with reference
to figures. Fig.1 shows a block diagram of a mobile
communication system to which the handover control
method of the present invention is applied.</p>
    <p num="0023">The mobile communication system 100 shown
in the figure includes a mobile station 110, a
mobile station control apparatus 130 which is a
communication control apparatus, base stations 150
(150-1 - 150-4) each of which is a communication
apparatus controlled by the base station control
apparatus 130 and a switch 160.</p>
    <p num="0024">In the mobile communication system 100,
each base station forms a cell which is a
communication area. The mobile station 110 is
positioned in a cell formed by the base station 150-1,
and transmits and receives user data such as
voice data to/from the base station 150-1 of a
communication partner. In addition, the mobile 
station receives perch channels from the base
stations 150-2 - 150-4 surrounding the base station
150-1. The base station control apparatus 130
selects a candidate base station for a handover
destination from the base stations 150-2 - 150-4 and
reserves wireless resources of the selected base
station when received power of the perch channel
from the base station 150-1 falls below a threshold
(handover standby threshold) which is a better value
than a limitation value by which communication is
available. Then, the mobile station 110 switches a
communication partner to the base station selected
by the base station control apparatus 130 when the
received power of the perch channel from the base
station 150-1 falls below a handover threshold
(handover threshold &lt; handover standby threshold)
which is a better value than a limitation value by
which communication is available.</p>
    <p num="0025">Fig.2 shows a configuration example of the
mobile station 110. The mobile station 110 shown in
Fig.2 includes a transmit/receive control part 111,
a communication quality measuring part 112, a
handover standby operation control part 113, a perch
channel received power measuring part 119, a
handover destination candidate base station
detection part 120 and a handover operation control
part 121. The handover standby operation control
part 113 includes a handover standby operation
request part 114, a timer 115, a moved history
notification part 116, a memory 117 and a handover
request part 118.</p>
    <p num="0026">A communication quality measuring part 112
receives a perch channel from the base station 150-1
of the communication partner via the
transmit/receive control part 111, and measures the
received power. The handover standby operation
control part 114 determines whether the received 
power of the perch channel from the base station
150-1 falls below the handover standby threshold on
the basis of the result of the measurement of the
communication quality measuring part 112. When the
received power falls below the handover standby
threshold, the handover standby operation request
part 114 sends a handover standby operation request
to the base station control apparatus 130, and
activates the timer 115, the moved history
notification part 116 and the perch channel received
power measuring part 119.</p>
    <p num="0027">The moved history notification part 116 is
activated by the handover standby operation request
part 114, and reads a moved history of the mobile
station 110 from the memory 117. The moved history
is formed, for example, by a history (handover
history) of base stations which have become a
communication partner after the current
communication started, or a history of cells formed
by each base station in which the mobile station has
resides. The moved history read from the memory 117
is sent to the base station control apparatus 130
via the transmit/receive control part 111.</p>
    <p num="0028">The perch channel received power measuring
part 119 is activated by the handover standby
operation request part 114, and, then, receives
perch channels of the base stations 150-2 - 150-4
surrounding the base station 150-1 of the
communication partner a plurality of times via the
transmit/receive control part 111, and measures the
received powers. The measurement result of received
powers of the perch channels from the base stations
150-2 - 150-4 is sent to the base station control
apparatus 130 via the transmit/receive control part
111.</p>
    <p num="0029">The base station control apparatus 130
selects at least a handover destination candidate 
base station from the base stations 150-2 - 150-4
according to the moved history sent from the mobile
station 110 and the measurement result of the
received powers of the perch channels from the base
stations 150-2 - 150-4. In addition, the base
station control apparatus 130 assigns priorities to
the base stations and sends the selection result of
the handover destination candidate base stations and
the proprieties to the mobile station 110. The
detailed process of the base station control
apparatus 130 will be described later.</p>
    <p num="0030">The handover destination candidate base
station detection part 120 detects the selection
result of the handover destination candidate base
stations and the priorities from the base station
control apparatus 130, and sends them to the
handover operation control part 121.</p>
    <p num="0031">The commination quality measurement part
112 continues to measure the received power of the
perch channel from the base station 150-1 of the
communication partner. After the handover operation
control part 121 receives the selection result of
the handover destination candidate base station and
the priorities from the base station control
apparatus 130, the handover operation control part
121 selects a handover destination from the selected
handover destination candidate base stations to
start the handover operation when the received power
of the perch channel from the base station 150-1 of
the communication partner falls below the handover
threshold by the time when the timer 115 expires.</p>
    <p num="0032">More concretely, the handover operation
control part 121 determines whether the received
power of the perch channel from each handover
destination candidate base station is larger than
the handover threshold.</p>
    <p num="0033">Next, the handover operation control part 
121 tries to perform handover to at least a handover
destination candidate base station having the
received power which is larger than the handover
threshold in the order of priority so as to switch
the communication partner. When every received
power of the perch channels from the handover
destination candidate base stations included in the
selection result is below the handover threshold,
the handover operation control part 121 does not
perform handover, or, performs handover to a
handover destination candidate base station in which
the received power of the perch channel is the
largest for switching the communication partner.</p>
    <p num="0034">On the other hand, when one of following
two cases occurs, the handover operation control
part 121 performs handover to a handover destination
candidate base station having the highest received
power so that the communication partner is switched.
One case is that the handover operation control part
121 does not receive the selection result of the
handover destination candidate base stations and the
priorities from the base station control apparatus
13 by the time when the received power of the perch
channel from the base station 150-1 of the
communication partner falls below the handover
threshold value. Another case is that no base
station is selected as the handover destination
candidate base station even when the received power
of the perch channel from the base station 150-1 of
the communication partner falls below the handover
threshold by the time of expiration of the timer 115
after the selection result of the handover
destination candidate base station and the
priorities from the base station control apparatus
130 are received.</p>
    <p num="0035">In addition, the handover operation
control part 121 does not perform handover operation 
when the received power of the perch channel from
the base station 150-1 of the communication partner
does not fall below the handover threshold by the
time of the expiration of the timer 115.</p>
    <p num="0036">The handover request part 118 sends a
handover request to the base station control
apparatus 130 via the transmit/receive control part
111 when the received power of the perch channel
from the base station 150-1 of the communication
partner further decreases so that the received power
falls below the handover threshold by the time of
expiration of the timer 115. This handover request
includes information by which a base station to
which the handover operation control part 121 tries
handover is specified, that is, information by which
a base station of the handover destination is
specified. The base station control apparatus 130
performs predetermined control for handover
according to this handover request.</p>
    <p num="0037">Fig.3 shows a configuration example of the
base station control apparatus 130. The base
station control apparatus 130 includes a
receive/transmit control part 131, a handover
standby operation request detection part 132, a
handover standby operation control part 133, a timer
138, a wireless resource management part 139, a
handover request detection part 140 and a handover
control part 141. Among these, the handover standby
operation control part 133 includes a moved history
detection part 134, a perch channel measurement
detection part 135, a handover destination candidate
selection part 136 and a memory 137.</p>
    <p num="0038">When the handover standby operation
request detection part 132 receives a handover
standby operation request from the handover standby
operation request part 114 in the mobile station 110,
the handover standby operation request detection 
part 132 activates the handover standby operation
control part 133 and the timer 138.</p>
    <p num="0039">The moved history detection part 134 in
the handover standby operation control part 133
detects a moved history (handover history or area
residing history) of the mobile station 110 which is
sent from the moved history notification part 116 in
the mobile station 110. The perch channel
measurement result detection part 135 detects the
measurement result of the received powers of the
perch channels from the base stations 150-2 - 150-4
sent from the perch channel received power
measurement part in the mobile station 110.</p>
    <p num="0040">The handover destination candidate
selection part 136 selects at least a handover
destination candidate base station and assigns
priorities to the handover destination candidate
base stations by comparing mobile station
information with a history of mobile station
information of past successful handover stored in
the memory 137, in which the mobile station
information includes moved history of the mobile
station 110 detected by the moved history detection
part 134 and received powers of perch channels from
the base stations 150-2 - 150-4 detected by the
perch channel measurement result detection part 136.</p>
    <p num="0041">Fig.4 shows an example of the history of
the mobile station information of the past
successful handover stored in the memory 137. The
history shown in Fig.4 is a history of mobile
station information of past successful handover for
every base station controlled by the base station
control apparatus 130. In addition, each history
data of the mobile station information corresponds
to a combination of a base station of handover
origination and a base station of handover
destination. Each data of the mobile station 
information history Xmn indicates moved history and
an average value of received powers of the perch
channels when the mobile station handed over from
the base station m of handover origination to the
base station n of the handover destination.</p>
    <p num="0042">The handover destination candidate
selection part 136 extracts histories indicating the
base station 150-1 as a base station of handover
origination among the histories of the mobile
station information stored in the memory 137. Next,
the handover destination candidate selection part
136 correlates between each extracted history data
of mobile station information and the mobile station
information from the mobile station 110. Then, the
handover destination candidate selection part 136
selects, as the handover destination candidate base
station, a base station of handover destination
corresponding to a history of the mobile station
information in which the correlation value with the
mobile station information from the mobile station
110 is equal to or more than a predetermined
threshold value.</p>
    <p num="0043">In addition, when the handover destination
candidate selection part 136 selects a plurality of
handover destination candidate base stations, the
handover destination candidate selection part 136
determines the priorities in the decreasing order of
correlation value. When there is no mobile station
information history in which the correlation value
is equal to or more than the predetermined threshold,
the handover destination candidate selection part
136 outputs a selection result indicating there is
no handover destination candidate base station.</p>
    <p num="0044">The wireless resource management part 139
keeps wireless resource in the handover destination
candidate base station selected by the handover
destination candidate selection part 136. Next, the 
wireless resource management part 136 notifies the
mobile station of the handover destination candidate
base station in which wireless resource is kept via
the transmit/receive control part 131. When it
fails to keep wireless resources for every handover
destination candidate base station, or, when a
selection result indicating that there is no
handover destination candidate base station is
obtained by the handover destination candidate
selection part 136, the wireless resource management
part 136 notifies the mobile station 110 of it.</p>
    <p num="0045">As mentioned above, when the received
power of the perch channel from the base station
150-1 falls below the handover threshold, the mobile
station 110 sends a handover request to the base
station control apparatus 130. Then, the base
station control apparatus 130 selects the handover
destination according to the notification and starts
handover operation.</p>
    <p num="0046">The handover request detection part 140
receives the handover request from the mobile
station 110, and outputs the handover request to the
handover control part 141. When the handover
control part 141 receives the handover request by
the time of expiration of the timer 138, the
handover control part 141 recognizes a base station
of the handover destination on the basis of
information for specifying the base station of the
handover destination included in the handover
request so that it performs predetermined control
for handover. On the other hand, the handover
control part 141 ends the operations when the
handover request is not received by the time of the
expiration of the timer 138.</p>
    <p num="0047">When the handover request is input to the
handover control part 141 by the time of the
expiration of the timer 138, the wireless resource 
management part 138 recognizes the base station of
handover destination on the basis of information
specifying the base station of the handover
destination included in the handover request, and
releases wireless resources kept in base stations
other than the base station of the handover
destination. On the other hand, when the handover
request is not input to the handover control part
141 by the time of the expiration of the timer 138,
the wireless resource management part 138 releases
every wireless resource which is reserved.</p>
    <p num="0048">As mentioned above, since the wireless
resource management part 139 releases the wireless
resources when the timer 138 expires, the expiration
time interval of the timer 138 is set to be longer
than that of the timer 115 in the mobile station 110
such that it does not occur that handover is
impossible since the wireless recourse is already
released when the mobile station 110 request
handover.</p>
    <p num="0049">When the handover ends, the moved history
detection part 134 outputs moving history of the
mobile station 110 to the memory 137 and updates
history of mobile station information stored in the
memory 137. In the same way, the perch channel
measurement result detection part 135 outputs
measurement results of received power of perch
channels from the base stations 150-2 - 150-4 and
updates the history of the mobile station
information stored in the memory 137.</p>
    <p num="0050">If handover to other base station occurs
or the communication is interrupted within a
predetermined period after handover completed, it
can not be said that it is proper handover.
Therefore, in such a case, the moved history
detection part 134 and the perch channel measurement
detection part 135 do not output the moved history 
of the mobile station 110 and the measurement result
of received powers of the perch channels from the
base stations 150-2 - 150-4 such that the mobile
station information stored in the memory is
prevented from being updated.</p>
    <p num="0051">Fig.5 is a flowchart indicating the
operation of the mobile communication system at the
time of handover. In this flowchart, it is assumed
that the received power of the perch channel from
the base station 150-1 of the communication partner
does not fall below the handover threshold before
the mobile station 110 receives a handover
destination candidate base station from the base
station control apparatus 130.</p>
    <p num="0052">The handover standby operation request
part 114 in the mobile station 110 determines
whether the received power Q of the perch channel
from the base station 150-1 measured by the
communication quality measuring part 112 falls below
the handover standby threshold S<sub>HOP</sub> in step 101.
When it falls below the handover standby threshold
S<sub>HOP</sub>, the timer 115 is activated in step 102. Next,
the handover standby operation request part 114
sends a handover standby operation request to the
base station control apparatus 130 in step 103.</p>
    <p num="0053">When the handover standby operation
request detection part 132 in the base station
control apparatus 130 receives the handover standby
operation request in step 104, the timer 138 is
activated in step 105.</p>
    <p num="0054">After the handover standby operation
request part 114 sends a handover standby operation
request to the base station control apparatus 130 in
step 103, the moved history notification part 116 in
the mobile station 110 reads moved history (handover
history or area residing history) of the mobile
station 110 from the memory 117, and sends the moved 
history to the base station control apparatus 130 in
step 106. The moved history detection part 134 in
the base station control apparatus 130 receives the
moved history of the mobile station 110 in step 107.</p>
    <p num="0055">The perch channel received power measuring
part 119 in the mobile station 110 receives the
perch channels from the base stations 150-2 - 150-4
surrounding the base station 150-1 of the
communication partner, measures the received powers
in step 108, and sends the measurement result to the
base station control apparatus 130 in step 109.</p>
    <p num="0056">The perch channel measurement detection
part 135 in the base station control apparatus 130
receives the measurement result of the received
powers of the perch channels from the mobile
stations 150-2 - 150-4 in step 110. Next, the
handover destination candidate selection part 136
compares moved history of the mobile station 110
detected by the moved history detection part 134 and
the received powers of the perch channels from the
base stations 150-2 - 150-4 detected by the perch
channel measurement detection part 135 (mobile
station information) with history of mobile station
information of past successful handover so that the
handover destination candidate base station is
selected in step 111.</p>
    <p num="0057">The wireless resource management part 139
keeps wireless resources in the handover destination
candidate base station selected by the handover
destination candidate selection part 136 in step 112,
and notifies the mobile station 110 of the handover
destination candidate base station in step 113.</p>
    <p num="0058">The handover destination candidate base
station detection part 120 in the mobile station 110
receives selection result of the handover
destination candidate base station from the base
station control apparatus 130 in step 114. Next, 
the handover operation control part 121 judges
whether the timer 115 has expired in step 115. When
the timer 115 has expired, the handover operation is
not performed. Instead, operations after the
judgment whether the received power Q of the perch
channel from the base station 150-1 falls below the
handover standby threshold S<sub>HOP</sub> by the handover
standby operation control part 114 (step 101) are
repeated.</p>
    <p num="0059">On the other hand, when the timer has not
expired, the handover operation control part 121
judges whether the received power Q of the perch
channel from the base station 150-1 of the
communication partner falls below the handover
threshold S<sub>HO</sub> in step 116. When the received power Q
of the perch channel from the base station 150-1 of
the communication partner is not below the handover
threshold S<sub>HO</sub>, operations after the judgment (step
115) whether the timer 115 has expired by the
handover operation control part 121 are repeated.</p>
    <p num="0060">On the other hand, when the received power
Q of the perch channel from the base station 150-1
of the communication partner falls below the
handover threshold S<sub>HO</sub>, handover operation starts in
step 117.</p>
    <p num="0061">The wireless resource management part 139
of the base station control apparatus 130 judges
whether handover by the mobile station 110 ends in
step 118. When handover by the mobile station 110
has not ended, the wireless resource management part
139 judges whether the timer 138 expires in step 119.
When the timer has not expired, the operation after
the judgment whether handover by the mobile station
has ended (step 118) is repeated. When the timer
138 expires, the wireless resource management part
138 releases all wireless resources which are kept
in step 120. </p>
    <p num="0062">On the other hand, when it is judged that
the handover by the mobile station 110 has ended in
step 118, the wireless resource management part 138
releases wireless resources kept in base stations
other than the base station of the handover
destination in step 120.</p>
    <p num="0063">As mentioned above, in the mobile
communication system 100, when the received power of
the perch channel from the base station 150-1 of the
communication partner falls below the handover
standby threshold, the mobile station 110 sends a
handover standby operation request to the base
station control apparatus 130 and sends moved
history of the mobile station itself and received
powers of the perch channels from the base stations
150-2 - 150-4 (mobile station information ). Then,
the base station control apparatus 130 compares the
mobile station information with the history of
mobile station information so as to select the
handover destination candidate base station and
notifies the mobile station 110 of the handover
destination candidate base station. The mobile
station 110 switches communication partner to the
handover destination candidate base station when the
received power of the perch channel from the base
station 150-1 falls below the handover threshold.</p>
    <p num="0064">Therefore, it does not occur that handover
is performed since the received power from the
surrounding base station 150-2 - 150-4 is larger
than a predetermined value even when the received
power of the perch channel from the base station
150-1 is large enough. Thus, unnecessary handover
can be suppressed so that wireless resources can be
used efficiently, and load of the mobile station 110
and the base station control apparatus 130 can be
decreased.</p>
    <p num="0065">In addition, since the wireless resources 
of the base station of the handover destination can
be kept before handover is performed, it can be
avoided that the base station rejects handover so
that communication is disconnected forcefully. Thus,
success ratio of handover can be increased.</p>
    <p num="0066">In the above mentioned embodiments, the
base station forms a cell as the communication area.
However, it can be considered that the base station
forms a plurality of sectors to which the cell is
divided. In this case, an apparatus
(transmit/receive apparatus) which has at least a
directional antenna in a plurality of directional
antennas provided in a base station for forming the
sectors corresponds to the communication apparatus.
In other words, a base station includes a plurality
of transmit/receive apparatuses, and each
transmit/receive apparatus forms the sector.</p>
    <p num="0067">Also in this case, control same as that in
the above-mentioned embodiments is performed. That
is, when the received power of the perch channel
from the transmit/receive apparatus of the
communication partner falls below the handover
standby threshold, the mobile station sends the
handover standby operation request to the base
station control apparatus 130 and sends moved
history of the mobile station itself and received
powers of the perch channels from the surrounding
transmit/receive apparatuses (mobile station
information ). Then, the base station control
apparatus compares the mobile station information
with the history of mobile station information so as
to select the handover destination candidate
transmit/receive apparatus and notifies the mobile
station of the handover destination candidate
transmit/receive apparatus. The mobile station
switches communication partner to the handover
destination candidate transmit/receive apparatus 
when the received power of the perch channel from
the transmit/receive apparatus of the communication
partner falls below the handover threshold. The
history of the mobile station information held in
the communication control apparatus is held for each
combination of a transmit/receive apparatus of
handover origination and a transmit/receive
apparatus of handover destination.</p>
    <p num="0068">As mentioned above, according to the
present invention, it does not occur that handover
is performed since the received power from the
surrounding base station is larger than a
predetermined value even when the received power of
the perch channel from the base station is large
enough. Thus, unnecessary handover can be
suppressed so that wireless resources can be used
efficiently, and load of the mobile station and the
base station control apparatus can be decreased.</p>
    <p num="0069">In addition, since the wireless resources
of the base station of the handover destination can
be kept before handover is performed, it can be
avoided that the base station rejects handover so
that communication is disconnected forcefully. Thus,
success ratio of handover can be increased.</p>
    <p num="0070">The present invention is not limited to
the specifically disclosed embodiments, and
variations and modifications may be made without
