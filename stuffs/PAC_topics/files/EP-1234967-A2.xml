        <u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0003">In a gasoline engine, an intake negative
pressure or intake vacuum produced by a throttling
operation of a throttle valve to restrain load is liable to
increase pumping loss (throttle loss) and hence to
deteriorate the thermal efficiency and fuel consumption in
light load region, as compared to a diesel engine having
no throttle valve. This problem can be met by the
technique of regulating the intake air quantity by varying
the intake valve lift characteristic. When an air flowmeter
is needed, however, the addition of the air flowmeter
tends to complicate the construction and increase the cost.
Moreover, the measurement of intake air quantity is more
or less inaccurate due to back flow formed near the air
flowmeter in the intake passage by intake pressure
fluctuation. By increasing the volume of a collector
section on the upstream side of the intake ports of engine
cylinders, it is possible to reduce the intake pressure 
amplitude and restrain the back flow near the air
flowmeter. In this case, however, the volume increase of
the collector section increases a time from an actual
change in the intake air quantity caused by a change in
the valve lift characteristic, to a reflective change in the
measurement of the air flowmeter. As a result, the
measurement of the intake air quantity tends to be less
accurate in such a transient state, and the control of the
fuel injection quantity and air-fuel ratio based on the
intake air quantity measurement tends to be less accurate.</p>
    <p num="0004">It is an object of the present invention to
provide method/system for measuring or controlling
intake air quantity, specifically in a very light load engine
operating region.</p>
    <p num="0005">According to the present invention, an intake

intake valve operating characteristic, comprises: sensing
an engine speed; sensing an intake valve lift; detecting a
very light engine load region; and calculating an intake air
quantity in accordance with the engine speed and the
intake valve lift when the very light engine load region is
detected.</p>

        <u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0013">FIG. 4 show an engine control system including
an intake air quantity measuring apparatus according to
one embodiment of the present invention. In this
embodiment, the engine is a four-cylinder internal
combustion gasoline engine.</p>
    <p num="0014">When, in a very light load region including an
idling operation, the valve lift of an intake valve is
reduced to a certain limit, the intake air flow is brought to
a choked state, and the speed of the intake air flow
through a gap formed by an intake valve approaches the
speed of sound. In this choked state, a change in the
intake valve timing can cause no or little change in the
flow rate. The quantity of intake air flowing into an
engine cylinder is determined basically by the intake valve
lift alone. If, in a very low lift state (or minimum lift
state) in which the intake valve lift is equal to or lower
than the above-mentioned limit, the intake valve closing
timing is advanced excessively to a point near top dead
center (TDC), then the intake valve closes at such a
timing that the piston stroke is still insufficient, and the
combustion tends to deteriorate because of insufficient
increase in the incylinder pressure and temperature near
top dead center.</p>
    <p num="0015">Specifically when fine adjustment of the intake
air quantity is required in the very low lift state where the
intake air quantity is very small, as in the case of an
increase in the engine load from the idle state by drive of
an accessory, the setting of fuel injection quantity and
air-fuel ratio after the measurement of intake air quantity
by an air flowmeter tends to incur a considerable delay
from an actual increase in the intake air quantity to an 
increase in the fuel injection quantity, which could incur
engine stall due to excessively lean condition.</p>
    <p num="0016">In the very low lift state where the intake air
quantity is very small, the rate of change of the air-fuel
ratio with respect to the intake air quantity becomes
greater as compared to the other engine operating states
where the intake air quantity is greater, so that the
accurate measurement of the intake air quantity is
demanded. On the other hand, in the other engine
operating states other than the very low lift state, the
intake valve lift is so high that the intake air quantity is
not changed so much by a change of the intake valve lift.
Rather, the intake air quantity tends to change largely
under the influence of intake pulsation due to changes in
intake valve timing, i.e., intake valve opening timing and
closing timing.</p>
    <p num="0017">In view of this, the intake air quantity
measuring apparatus according to this embodiment of the
present invention is devised to measure and control the
intake air quantity and fuel supply quantity accurately
even in the very low lift state with a simplified
construction which does not require a throttle valve and
an air flowmeter.</p>
    <p num="0018">A collector section 24 of the engine shown in
FIG. 4 is provided at one side of a cylinder block 30.
Collector section 24 is connected with four intake ports of
four engine cylinders 31 arranged in a row, through four
intake branches 32, respectively. A negative pressure
regulating valve 21 is disposed in an intake passage on
the upstream side of the collector section 24. Negative
pressure regulating valve 21 is not a valve intended to
regulate the engine intake air quantity, but a regulating
valve designed to produce an intake negative pressure (or 
intake vacuum) used for blow-by and fuel vapor. That is,
negative pressure regulating valve 24 is designed to
produce a minimum negative pressure required by the
engine.</p>
    <p num="0019">An intake control section of this engine control
system includes an intake valve operating angle altering
mechanism 1 and a phase altering mechanism 15. Intake
valve operating angle altering mechanism 1 is capable of
continuously varying both of an intake valve operating
angle (valve opening period) and a valve lift (herein
referred to as lift operating angle). Phase altering
mechanism 15 is capable of varying the phase of the
center of the intake valve lift operating angle with respect
to the phase of the crankshaft rotation. This engine
control system can continuously vary the intake valve lift
(quantity) and valve timing (opening timing and closing
timing) with operating angle altering mechanism 1 and
phase altering mechanism 15.</p>
    <p num="0020">Thus, the engine control system according to
this embodiment controls the intake air quantity by
controlling the valve lift and valve timing. Moreover, the
engine control system senses parameters corresponding to
the valve lift and valve timing, and calculates the intake
air quantity and fuel injection quantity accurately in
accordance with the sensed parameters. In this way, the
engine system can control the intake air quantity and fuel
injection quantity accurately with a simple structure
without requiring a throttle valve and an air flowmeter.</p>
    <p num="0021">An ECU (engine control unit) 17 serving as a
controller is a central component of the engine control
system. ECU 17 includes a microcomputer having at least
one memory and CPU for performing various engine
control operations. Input information on engine operating 
conditions is inputted to ECU from a sensor (or input)
section of the engine control system. In this example, the
sensor section includes a pressure sensor 22 for sensing a
pressure in collector section 24; a collector temperature
sensor 23 for sensing a temperature in collector section
24; a crank angle sensor 26 for sensing an engine speed
(rpm); an A/F sensor (or oxygen sensor) 27 for sensing an
air-fuel ratio of an exhaust gas mixture in an exhaust
passage 33 of the engine; and an engine temperature
sensor 28 for sensing an engine temperature (or a
temperature of engine coolant). The sensor section of
this example further includes a control shaft angle sensor
14 and a drive shaft angle sensor 16, as explained later.
These sensors are connected with ECU 17.</p>
    <p num="0022">An actuator (or output) section of the engine
control system of this example includes (an actuator 13
of) the operating angle altering mechanism 1, phase
altering mechanism 15, and an actuator 25 of negative
pressure regulating valve 21. ECU 17 controls these
components of the actuator section by delivering control
signals.</p>
    <p num="0023">FIG. 1 shows the operating angle altering
mechanism 1.</p>
    <p num="0024">Above an intake valve 11, a drive shaft 2
extend in a direction of row of cylinders of the engine.
Rotation of a crank shaft is transmitted to drive shaft 2.
Therefore, drive shaft 2 rotates about its own axis in
timed relationship with the crank shaft.</p>
    <p num="0025">An eccentric cam 3 for each cylinder is fixedly
or integrally formed on drive shaft 2 so that the center of
the cam is off the center axis of drive shaft 2. A first link
4 shaped like a ring is fit over eccentric cam 3 in such a
manner that first link 4 can rotate relative to eccentric 
cam 3. A control shaft 12 extends in parallel to drive
shaft 2 in the cylinder row direction of the engine. A
control cam 18 for each cylinder is fixedly or integrally
formed on this control shaft 12 in such an eccentric
manner that the center of the cam is off the center axis of
control shaft 12. A center portion of a rocker arm 6 is
rotatably fit over control cam 18, so that rocker arm 6 is
rotatably mounted on control cam 18. Rocker arm 6
includes a first arm end connected with one end of first
link 4 through a first connecting pin 5, and a second arm
end connected with one end of a rod-shaped second link 8
through a second connecting pin 7. The other end of
second link 8 is connected through a third connecting pin
19 with a projecting end of a rocker cam 9 rotatably
mounted on drive shaft 2.</p>
    <p num="0026">When drive shaft 2 is driven by the crank shaft,
drive shaft 2 rotates, and eccentric cam 3 mounted on this
rotating shaft 2 causes first link 4 to move up and down
as viewed in FIG. 1, approximately in a manner of
translational motion. This translational motion of first link
4 is then converted to swing motion of rocker arm 6, and
second link 8 causes rocker cam 13 to swing about the
center axis of drive shaft 2. This rocker cam 9 abuts
against and pushes down a valve lifter 10 for intake valve
11, and thereby opens intake valve 11 against the force of
a valve spring of the intake valve.</p>
    <p num="0027">An actuator 13 is constructed to rotate control
shaft 12 in accordance with engine operating condition,
and thereby to shift the center of control cam 18. By thus
shifting the center of control cam 18 about which rocker
arm 6 swings, actuator 13 can change the attitudes of
rocker arm 6 and links 4 and 11, and alter the swing
characteristic of rocker cam 13. In this way, actuator 13 
can continuously vary the operating angle and valve lift
quantity of intake valve 11.</p>
    <p num="0028">In the thus-constructed operating angle altering
mechanism, rocker cam 9 is mounted coaxially on drive
shaft 2. This coaxial arrangement is advantageous in
preventing misalignment or maladjustment of rocker cam
9 and drive shaft 2, and hence superior in control
accuracy. Moreover, rocker arm 6 and links 4 and 8 are
arranged closely around the valve drive shaft 2, to the
advantage to the compactness of the operating angle
altering mechanism. Most of members are in contact with
one another over an area. This construction is
advantageous in lubrication, durability and reliability. For
example, the bearing interface portion between eccentric
cam 3 and first link 4, and the bearing interface portion
between control cam 18 and rocker arm 6 have substantial
contact areas.</p>
    <p num="0029">When this altering mechanism is applied to an
ordinary direct drive type valve operating system having a
fixed cam and cam shaft, the application is very easy
because the fixed cam and cam shaft can be replaced by
rocker cam and valve drive shaft with no or little change
in the layout.</p>
    <p num="0030">Phase altering mechanism 15 varies the phase
of drive shaft 2 with respect to the crank shaft, and
thereby continuously vary the phase of the center of the
intake valve lift operating angle. Among known phase
altering mechanisms, there are a type using vane, and a
type using helical splines.</p>
    <p num="0031">Control shaft angle sensor 14 is arranged to
sense the angle of control shaft 12 corresponding to the
operating angle and valve lift of intake valve 11. Drive
shaft angle sensor 16 is arranged to sense the angle of 
drive shaft 2 corresponding to the phase of the center
(center phase) of the operating angle of intake valve 11.</p>
    <p num="0032">In the system including both the operating
angle altering mechanism 1 for varying the intake valve
operating angle and valve lift and the phase altering
mechanism 15 for varying the center phase of the
operating angle, the operating angle and valve lift can be
altered only by operating angle altering mechanism 1. On
the other hand, the valve timing is altered by either of
operating angle altering mechanism 1 and phase altering
mechanism 15. In this embodiment, the control system
can sense the parameter corresponding to the valve
timing (valve opening point and valve closing point)
indirectly in accordance with the sensed control shaft
angle corresponding to the operating angle and the sensed
drive shaft angle corresponding to the center phase.</p>
    <p num="0033">FIG. 2 shows two operating regions of different
control modes employed in this embodiment. FIG. 3
shows settings of intake valve lift operating angle and
center phase in various engine operating states in this
example.</p>
    <p num="0034">As shown in the uppermost row in FIG. 3, in the
very low load region (corresponding to a valve lift control
region shown in FIG. 2) including an idle region, the
required intake air quantity is very small, and hence the
control system sets a very low lift state in which the
intake valve lift operating angle is equal to or lower than
a lift operating angle limit, with operating angle altering
mechanism 1.</p>
    <p num="0035">When the valve lift is reduced into the very low
lift state, the speed of the flow approaches the speed of
sound, and the fluid flow in the gap of the intake valve is
brought to the choked state. In such a state, a change in 
the intake valve timing causes no or little change in the
flow rate. Therefore, the intake air quantity of the intake
air flowing into the cylinder is basically determined only
by the amount of the valve lift.</p>
    <p num="0036">In the very low lift state corresponding to the
very light load region, therefore, the control system
controls the intake air quantity and fuel injection quantity
by using the valve lift as a main parameter. The control
system calculates the intake air quantity in accordance
with the valve lift sensed (estimated) by using control
shaft angle sensor 14 and crank angle sensor 26, and the
engine speed, and further calculates the fuel injection
quantity in accordance with this intake air quantity.</p>
    <p num="0037">In the very low lift state below the valve lift
limit, if the intake valve closing timing is advanced
excessively toward top dead center (TDC), the intake
valve is closed in the state in which the piston stroke is
insufficient, and the incylinder pressure and temperature
could not rise sufficiently near top dead center. Therefore,
excessive advancement of the intake valve closing timing
toward top dead center (TDC) could deteriorate the
combustion. In order to ensure the effective compression
ratio and stabilize the combustion in the very low lift state,
the intake valve closing timing is retarded to a point near
bottom dead center. In this example, the center phase is
retarded to or near the most retarded phase by phase
altering mechanism 15. In this very low lift state, the
valve lift is used as the main parameter for the control, so
that there is no possibility that the phase of the center of
the lift operating angle is advanced too much by phase
altering mechanism 15.</p>
    <p num="0038">Moreover, this control system employs a minus
overlap setting in the very low lift state. In the minus 
overlap setting, the intake valve opening timing is
retarded widely from top dead center and from the
exhaust valve closing timing. This minus overlap setting
is intended to improve the combustion by increasing the
effective compression ratio. Variation in the residual gas
quantity is small as compared to the ordinary valve
overlap, so that the accuracy in the correction based on
the residual gas quantity can be improved.</p>
    <p num="0039">As shown in the second through sixth rows in
FIG. 3, in regions (valve timing control region) in which
the load is heavier than the very light load region in the
uppermost first row in FIG. 3, the combustion is stable
enough. Therefore, the operating angle and valve lift can
not be set lower than the above-mentioned limit, and the
above-mentioned choked state can not arise. Therefore,
the intake air quantity is not influenced so much by
changes in the valve lift. Rather, the intake air quantity
tends to be varied largely by influence of intake pulsation
due to changes in intake valve timing. Therefore, the
control system according to this embodiment controls the
intake air quantity and fuel injection quantity by using the
valve timing as a main parameter in the engine operating
regions other than the very low lift state corresponding to
the very light load region. The control system controls
the operating angle altering mechanism 1 and phase
altering mechanism 15 so as to achieve a valve timing
determined in accordance with the engine operating
conditions to reduce the pumping loss. Moreover, the
control system accurately calculates the base intake air
quantity in accordance with the valve timing (the
operating angle and center phase) sensed indirectly by the
sensors 14 and 16, and the engine speed, and determines 
the fuel injection quantity accurately in accordance with
the thus-determined intake air quantity.</p>
    <p num="0040">In the light load region shown in the second row
in FIG. 3, the control system of this example reduces the
induction resistance by slightly increasing the valve lift
and operating angle in compliance with the stabilization of
combustion, and reduces the pumping loss to improve the
fuel efficiency by advancing the intake valve closing
timing from bottom dead center by advancement of the
center phase.</p>
    <p num="0041">When the operating point shifts from the very
light load region to the light load region as in the case
when an accessory unit such as an air conditioner is
switched on in the idling state, the intake air quantity is
hardly changed by alteration of the center phase alone.
In this case, the control system increases the valve lift
quickly by driving the operating angle altering mechanism
1 first, and thereby improves the stability of combustion
in the transient state.</p>
    <p num="0042">In the medium load region shown in the third
row of FIG. 3, the stability of the combustion is further
improved as compared to the light load region. Therefore,
the control system further increases the valve lift and
advances the center phase. Moreover, the intake valve
opening timing is advanced beyond top dead center and
exhaust valve closing timing, to provide valve overlap to
improve the combustion with internal EGR and to reduce
the pumping loss. As shown in the lower three rows in
FIG. 3, in the heavy load region including the maximum
torque region (full open region), the operating angle is
increased as the engine speed increases.</p>
    <p num="0043">A boundary K between the valve lift control
region and the valve timing control region shown in FIG. 2 
shifts in dependence on the combustion stability state.
Therefore, by adjustment based on incylinder pressure,
torque variation, and unburnt fuel attached to the intake
valve, it is possible to expand the valve timing control
region of low pumping loss without regard to various
irregularities. Fuel atomization and temperature in
compression stroke exert significant influence on the
combustion state. Therefore, the correction based on the
engine temperature sensed by temperature sensor 28 is
specifically effective.</p>
    <p num="0044">The control system according to this
embodiment regulates the intake air quantity by
controlling the intake valve lift and valve timing in
accordance with engine operating conditions, and
calculates the intake air quantity and fuel supply quantity
in accordance with the sensed valve lift and timing.
Therefore, by eliminating the need for a throttle valve and
an air flowmeter, the control system of this embodiment
can reduce the number of required parts, and simplify the
control process and structure. Moreover, the control
system can prevent induction pulsation and reduce
throttle loss due to throttling operation of a throttle valve.</p>
    <p num="0045">Specifically in the very low lift state as in the
very light load operating region including idling, in which
the intake valve lift is very low and the intake air quantity
is hardly changed by changes in the valve timing, the
control according to this embodiment is based mainly on
the amount of valve lift. In other words, the control
system varies the valve lift to regulate the intake air
quantity by driving the operating angle altering
mechanism 1, and calculates the base intake air quantity
and fuel injection quantity in accordance with the valve
lift sensed by the sensor section. In the very low lift state, 
therefore, the control system can control the intake air
quantity and fuel injection quantity quickly and accurately.
In such a very light load region, the valve lift is varied
preferentially. Therefore, the control system can prevent
an undesired decrease in the compression ratio due to
excessive advancement of the intake valve closing timing,
reduce the pulsation of intake flow in the intake passage,
and hence calculate (or predict) the intake air quantity
accurately on the basis of the valve lift.</p>
    <p num="0046">In a transient state in which the engine load is
increased from the very light load region, as caused when
an accessory is driven at idling, the operating angle
altering mechanism 1 is driven preferentially to increase
the valve lift preferentially. Therefore, this control
system can increase the intake air quantity and fuel
injection quantity quickly and accurately in such a
transient state, and thereby reduce a deviation of the
actual air-fuel ratio from a desired air-fuel ratio
responsively.</p>
    <p num="0047">FIGS. 5A and 5B show a control flow according
to this embodiment. After sensing a required load of the
accessories, the control system controls operating angle
altering mechanism 1 and phase altering mechanism 15 so
as to achieve desired lift operating angle and desired
center phase to meet the required load at step S4. The
above-mentioned desired lift operating angle and desired
center phase are modified in accordance with the engine
speed ascertained at step S2, and the engine temperature
ascertained at step S3.</p>
    <p num="0048">At a section of steps S5 and S6, the intake
valve lift operating angle (the operating angle and valve
lift) is sensed by control shaft angle sensor 14, and the
center phase of the intake valve operating angle is sensed 
by drive shaft angle sensor 16. In this example, these
signals from the sensors 14 and 16 are used to control the
lift operating angle and center phase accurately in a
feedback control mode.</p>
    <p num="0049">At a section of steps S7 and S8 following the
section of steps S5 and S6, the pressure and temperature
in collector section 24 are sensed by pressure sensor 22
and collector temperature sensor 23.</p>
    <p num="0050">Step S9 is a step for examining whether the
engine operating point is in the very low lift state or not,
that is whether the operating point is in the valve lift
control region or in the valve timing control region, in
accordance with the engine load and engine speed by
using a control map as shown in FIG. 2. When the engine
operating point is in the valve timing control region, the
control system proceeds to step S11, senses (or
estimates) the intake valve timing in accordance with the
sensor signals from control shaft angle sensor 14 and
drive shaft angle sensor 16, and determines the base
intake air quantity in accordance with the sensed intake
valve timing and engine speed.</p>
    <p num="0051">When the engine operating point is in the valve
lift control region, the control system proceeds from step
S9 to S11, calculates the base intake air quantity mainly
in accordance with the sensed valve lift and engine speed,
and performs various corrective operations of steps
S12~S14. The corrections are: an area temperature
correction (S12) which is a minimum correction for
modifying the valve lift influenced by the engine
temperature; a valve-adhering fuel quantity correction
(S13) for modifying a minimum passage area influenced
by a quantity of fuel adhering to intake valve 11; and a
residual gas quantity correction (S14) for compensating 
for a change in a residual gas quantity due to a change in
the valve overlap (minus overlap) determined by the valve
timing. In the very low light load region including idle
region, the control system of this example provides a
minus valve overlap by setting the intake valve opening
timing later than the exhaust valve closing timing, in
order to stabilize the residual gas quantity. Therefore,
the control system can estimate the residual gas quantity
accurately and improve the accuracy of correction in the
intake air quantity based on the residual gas quantity. It
is possible to vary the base intake air quantity per se in
accordance with the pressure and temperature sensed at
steps S7 and S8, or to employ a corrective term by
holding the base intake air quantity unchanged. The
control system of this example performs a correction
based on a parameter representing the density of intake
air. The pressure and temperature in collector section 24
are used as the parameter representing the intake air
density. The flow rate determined by the intake valve lift
is a volume flow rate whereas the fuel injection quantity
should be determined on the basis of a mass flow rate of
the intake air. Therefore, the correction based on the
intake air density is effective.</p>
    <p num="0052">On the basis of the intake air quantity
calculated and modified at steps S10 or S11~S14, the
control system calculates the fuel injection quantity and
performs fuel injection at step S16 shown in FIG. 5B.
Moreover, the control system of this example controls the
fuel injection quantity in a feedback control mode based
on the exhaust air-fuel ratio, to compensate for a
deviation in the fuel injection quantity due to changes in
the valve clearance with time. In this example, step S17
senses the exhaust air-fuel ratio with exhaust A/F sensor 
27, and step S18 calculates a fuel feedback quantity in
accordance with the sensed exhaust air-fuel ratio, and
stores the fuel feedback quantity in a memory. At the
time of next fuel injection, the fuel feedback quantity is
used to correct the fuel injection quantity at step S15.</p>
    <p num="0053">In this embodiment, at least one of the
mechanisms 1 and 15 can serve as means for continuously
controlling the intake air quantity by varying the intake
valve operating characteristic. Sensor 26 can serve as
means for sensing the engine speed. Sensor 14 can serve
as means for sensing the intake valve lift. Digital
computer in ECU 17 can serve as means for discriminating
the very light engine load region, and means for
calculating the intake air quantity in a first control mode
at step S10, and means for calculating the intake air
quantity in a second control mode at step S11. ECM 17
can serve as a controller for detecting the very light load
region or judging whether the current intake valve lift is
equal to or lower than the predetermined value, to
discriminate the very low lift state from the other
operating states. Sensor 26 can serve as a first sensor to
sense the engine speed, and sensor 14 can serve as a
second sensor to sense the intake valve lift.</p>
