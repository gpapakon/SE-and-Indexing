      <u style="single">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0001">This invention relates generally to a
crystal producing method and, more particularly, to
a method and apparatus for producing calcium fluorite
(CaF2) which may be a material for an optical element
to be used in a lithographic exposure apparatus, for
example.</p>
    <p num="0002">Because of recent demands of reduction in
size and thickness of electronic instruments, further
miniaturization of semiconductor devices to be
incorporated into electronic instruments has been
required more and more. As regards the design rule
for a mask pattern, for example, mass-production of
a line-and-space (L&amp;S) 130 nm will be accomplished and,
to this end, it will be smaller and smaller. The
line-and-space (L&amp;S) is an image projected on a wafer,
in such state that the widths of the line and the space
are the same, and it is the scale of exposure resolution.
In the exposure process, three parameters of
resolution, overlay precision and throughput are
important. The resolution concerns a minimum size to
be accurately transferred, and the overlay precision
is the precision for superposing patterns upon a
workpiece. The throughput is the number of workpieces 
to be processed per unit time.</p>
    <p num="0003">Shortening the wavelength of an exposure
light source is effective to improve the resolution.
For this reason, recently, exposure light sources have
been changed from KrF excimer lasers (wavelength is
about 248 nm) to ArF excimer lasers (wavelength is
about 193 nm). Further, practical use of F2 excimer
lasers (wavelength is about 157 nm) has been advanced.
Among various glass materials, CaF2 crystal has a high
transmissivity (i.e., internal transmissivity) to
light of such wavelength region, and it is the best
optical material for an optical element such as lens
or diffraction grating to be used in an exposure
optical system.</p>
    <p num="0004">As regards parameters for evaluation of
optical characteristics of an optical material for a
lens or the like, one is internal transmissivity and,
in addition, there are laser durability which
represents changes in transmissivity where laser light
is continuously received, refractive index
uniformness (homogeneity) which represents that the
refractive index of a lens is constant with location,
birefringence index, processing (or polishing)
precision, and the like.</p>
    <p num="0005">CaF2 crystal having one or more good
optical characteristics as described above as well as
a method of producing such crystal, are disclosed in 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application, Laid-Open No.
315815/1997 or Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application,
Laid-Open No. 279378/1998.</p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0006">However, while CaF2 crystals produced by
conventional methods show good optical characteristic
with respect to visible light, the laser durability
to short-wavelength and large-power light such as
excimer lasers, for example, is low. The refractive
index homogeneity and birefringence index are large,
and the surface precision during polishing is not easy
to attain. Thus, optical characteristics are not
satisfactory. According to investigations made by
the inventors of the subject application, it has been
found that these inconveniences result from crystal
(or lattice) defect of CaF2 crystal or impurities
contained therein.</p>
    <p num="0007">It is accordingly an object of the present
invention to provide a unique and useful calcium
fluoride crystal by which at least one of the
above-described inconveniences can be solved, as well
as to provide at least one of a method and apparatus
for producing such calcium fluoride crystal, an
optical element using such calcium fluoride crystal,
an exposure apparatus having an optical system using
such optical element, a device manufacturing method 
using such exposure apparatus, and a device
manufactured by use of such exposure apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0008">More specifically, it is an object of the
present invention to provide a calcium fluoride
crystal and a method and apparatus for producing the
same, having good optical characteristics such as
laser durability, for example.</p>
    <p num="0009">It is another object of the present
invention to provide an optical element using such
calcium fluoride crystal and an exposure apparatus
(particularly, for photolithography using an excimer
laser as an exposure light source) having such optical
element used in an optical system.</p>
    <p num="0010">It is a further object of the present
invention to provide a device manufacturing method
using such exposure apparatus, and a quality device
(such as semiconductor, LCD, CCD, thin film magnetic
head, or the like) produced by using such exposure
apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0011">In accordance with an aspect of the present
invention, to achieve these objects, there is provided
a calcium fluoride crystal, characterized in that the
calcium fluoride crystal is produced in accordance
with a method for producing calcium fluoride crystal
on the basis of refining a raw material of calcium
fluoride and causing crystal growth of the refined
calcium fluoride, the method including a process for 
raising a purity of the calcium fluoride to complement
the refining, that a transition density in crystal is
not greater than 1x10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, and that dispersion of
transition density inside an effective portion in
crystal is in a range of ±5x10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p num="0012">The purity raising step may include: a
process for removing moisture contained in the calcium
fluoride crystal as an impurity; a process for removing
other adsorbed matters such as organic contaminants
inherently contained in the atmosphere, for example;
temperature control during the refining or growth such
as, for example, for setting optimum temperature
gradient about solid-liquid interface to promote
segregation; or process condition control for slowing
down the crystal growth speed or prolonging the vacuum
application time, for example.</p>
    <p num="0013">In accordance with another aspect of the
present invention, there is provided an optical
element which is produced from such CaF2 crystal.
Such calcium fluoride crystal has a small transition
density, and also the dispersion of transition density
is small. Thus, crystal defect is very few, and it
can provide an optical element having good optical
characteristics including refractive index
homogeneity, birefringence index, internal
transmissivity and laser durability. The optical
element may be one of a lens, a diffraction grating, 
an optical film and a composite of them, that is, for
example, a lens, a multiple lens, a lens array, a
lenticular lens, a fly's eye lens, an aspherical lens,
a diffraction grating, a binary optics element, and
a composite of them. In addition to a single element
of lens or the like, the optical element may be a
photosensor for focus control, for example.</p>
    <p num="0014">In accordance with a further aspect of the
present invention, there is provided a method of
producing calcium fluoride, comprising the steps of:
<sl><li>refining a raw material of calcium fluoride; causing
crystal growth of the refined calcium fluoride; and</li><li>removing, prior to said crystal growth step and in
addition to said refining step, moisture contained in
the calcium fluoride.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0015">In this method, since impurities are
removed by the moisture removing step, the amount of
scavenger to be added can be small. Thus, the amount
of residual scavenger contained in the crystal becomes
smaller, such that impurities or crystal defects are
reduced.</p>
    <p num="0016">Preferably, the method further comprises
a step of adding, prior to said refining step, a
scavenger of not less than 0.001 mol% and not greater
than 0.1 mol% to the raw material of calcium fluoride.</p>
    <p num="0017">More preferably, the amount of scavenger
addition may be 0.02 mol%. </p>
    <p num="0018">If the amount of scavenger addition is
large, the residual scavenger component causes a
decrease of refractive index homogeneity and
deterioration of internal transmissivity and laser
durability. Since the quantities defined above
cause smaller residue of scavenger, impurities
contained in the CaF2 crystal and crystal defects
(particularly, transition defect) are reduced, such
that the provision of quality CaF2 crystal is enabled.</p>
    <p num="0019">The moisture removing step may comprise
heating the raw material of calcium fluoride in a
vacuum ambience or a reduced pressure ambience. Such
process accelerates the moisture removal, if a vacuum
ambience or a reduced pressure ambience and heating
(baking) are combined.</p>
    <p num="0020">The heating process may comprise heating
a container (e.g., crucible) for accommodating the raw
material of calcium fluoride therein, to thereby heat
the raw material of calcium fluoride. This is
preferable in that unloading the raw material from the
container is unnecessary.</p>
    <p num="0021">The moisture removing step may be carried
out in a gas-flow ambience in which a gas (e.g.,
nitrogen or argon) for promoting removal of moisture
is flowed. The gas flow is effective to promote
moisture removal.</p>
    <p num="0022">In accordance with a yet further aspect of 
the present invention, there is provided an apparatus
for producing calcium fluoride crystal, comprising:
<sl><li>a first processing unit for refining a raw material
of calcium fluoride; a second processing unit for
causing crystal growth of the calcium fluoride; and</li><li>a third processing unit, separate from said first and
second units, for removing moisture contained in the
calcium fluoride.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0023">Although the first and second processing
units for refining and crystal growth may be generally
expensive, a separate third unit being relatively
inexpensive is used to improve the throughput and
economy as the whole production system.</p>
    <p num="0024">The third processing unit may include a
processing chamber for accommodating the raw material
of calcium fluoride therein, an exhaust unit for
maintaining a reduced pressure ambience or a vacuum
ambience inside said processing chamber, and a heating
unit for heating the raw material of calcium fluoride.</p>
    <p num="0025">The processing chamber may have a
container housed therein, for accommodating the raw
material of calcium fluoride therein, wherein said
heating unit may heat the raw material of calcium
fluoride together with said container.</p>
    <p num="0026">Such structure is preferable in that
unloading the raw material from the container is
unnecessary. </p>
    <p num="0027">In accordance with a still further aspect
of the present invention, there is provided an exposure
apparatus, characterized in that ultraviolet light,
deep ultraviolet light and/or vacuum ultraviolet light
is used as exposure light, and that a workpiece is
exposed by irradiating the same with the exposure light
through an optical system including an optical element
as recited above.</p>
    <p num="0028">Such exposure apparatus has similar
features as the optical element described above.</p>
    <p num="0029">In accordance with a still further aspect
of the present invention, there is provided a device
manufacturing method, comprising the steps of:
<sl><li>exposing a workpiece by use of an exposure apparatus
as recited above; and performing a predetermined
process to the exposed workpiece.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0030">The scope of the present invention related
to the device manufacturing method described above
extends, like that of the exposure apparatus, to a
device itself which may be an intermediate product or
a final product. The device may be a semiconductor
chip such as LSI or VLSI, or it may be CCD, LCD, magnetic
sensor or a thin film magnetic head, for example.</p>
    <p num="0031">These and other objects, features and
advantages of the present invention will become more
apparent upon a consideration of the following
description of the preferred embodiments of the 
present invention taken in conjunction with the

      <u style="single">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0040">The inventor has made experiments of
producing many CaF2 crystals, while changing
production conditions in the CaF2 crystal production,
and performed measurement of optical characteristics
(such as refractive index homogeneity, birefringence
index, spectral transmissivity, laser durability, and
gamma radiation durability) as well as crystal defect
(transition density) and impurity analyses.</p>
    <p num="0041">In regard to the laser durability,
deterioration of transmissivity in respect to ArF
laser (output of 30mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> and irradiation with 1x10<sup>4</sup>
pulses) and F2 laser (output of 3mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> and irradiation
with 1x10<sup>6</sup> pulses) , was measured. The gamma radiation
durability can be inspected easily and inexpensively
as compared with laser durability and, additionally,
it is possible to detect occurrence of color center
with respect to a larger crystal as a whole. As regards
irradiation condition, gamma radiation of radiation
dose rate 1x10<sup>6</sup>R/H was projected for 1 hour, and a total
dose 1x10<sup>6</sup> R was taken. On the basis of evaluations
for them, the inventor has found that crystals having 
good laser or gamma radiation durability and good
internal transmissivity have less impurity and less
crystal defect.</p>
    <p num="0042">Further, the inventor has found that
crystals having good crystal refractive index
homogeneity and good birefringence index have, like
evaluation of laser durability, less impurities and
less crystal defect (particularly, magnitude of
transition density and dispersion of transition
density with location within the crystal). Thus, in
order to improve the optical characteristics, the
content of particular elements that may result in
impurities must be suppressed to a level lower than
a predetermined. These elements are oxygen, carbon,
rare earth, and yttrium (Y) . It has also been found
that, among them, for reducing the transition density
and dispersion thereof, the moisture contained in CaF2
before growth (to be described later) as well as a
scavenger for removing the moisture should be
decreased. For example, zinc fluoride (AnF2)
scavenger is effective to reduce calcium oxide (CaO)
produced due to the presence of moisture and in
relation to CaF2, in accordance with formula 1 below,
into CaF2 in accordance with formula 2 below.
<st32:chr xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/">(Formula 1)

CaF2+H2O → CaO+2HF</st32:chr><st32:chr xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/">(Formula 2)

CaO+ZnF2 → CaF2+ZnO↑</st32:chr></p>
    <p num="0043">As described, moisture creates oxides, and
the content is larger than carbon, rare earth and Y.
The more the moisture is, the more the required
scavenger is. Further, residual scavenger component
not consumed becomes impurities to CaF2 crystal. For
these reasons, the amount of moisture and scavenger
should preferably be decreased.</p>
    <p num="0044">Next, an embodiment of a producing method
(1000) for producing CaF2 crystal and an optical
element of the present invention, based on a crucible
descending method, will be described. However, the
invention is not limited to use of crucible descending
method. Figure 1 shows a flow chart of an embodiment
of the present invention, for producing an optical
element using CaF2.</p>
    <p num="0045">Initially, as a raw material, a
high-purity synthetic raw material of CaF2 is prepared,
and the CaF2 material and a scavenger are mixed (step
1100). Such high-purity CaF2 synthetic raw material
may be produced by processing calcium carbonate with
fluoric acid. Although the present invention does not
exclude a method of removing impurities (e.g., SiO2)
by processing CaF2 ore with fluoric acid, the
high-purity CaF2 is powder as compared with the ore,
and the bulk density thereof is preferably very small
(about 10 - 20µ). It should be noted that, when the 
CaF2 raw material and the scavenger are mixed, it is
preferable that the CaF2 raw material and the scavenger
are put into a mixing container and that the container
is rotated to assure uniform mixing.</p>
    <p num="0046">As regards the scavenger, it may desirably
be zinc fluoride, cadmium fluoride, manganese fluoride,
bismuth fluoride, sodium fluoride, lithium fluoride
and the like, which can be easily bonded as compared
with fluoride to be grown and which can be easily
decomposed and evaporated. Those matters which can
easily react with oxides mixed in the fluoride raw
material and can be easily evaporated thereby, are
chosen. Particularly, zinc fluoride is desirable.
Here, it is important to control the amount of
scavenger addition.</p>
    <p num="0047">In this embodiment, the amount of addition
of scavenger is not less than 0.001 mol% and not greater
than 0.1 mol%, more preferably, 0.02 mol%. If the
amount of addition is large, it causes a decrease of
refractive index homogeneity due to residual scavenger
as well as deterioration of internal transmissivity
and laser durability. In other words, the amount of
addition mentioned above leads to less residual
scavenger and thus to less impurity and crystal defect
(particularly, transition density) in CaF2 crystal,
such that it can provide high quality CaF2 crystal.
The amount of scavenger addition can be decreased as 
mentioned above, by means of vacuum baking process
(steps 1200 and 1400) to be described below.</p>
    <p num="0048">As one feature of the present invention,
before a crystal growing process (step 1500), to be
described later, a vacuum baking process (steps 1200
and 1400) is provided. It should be noted here that
the effect of purity raising through the vacuum baking
may be attainable similarly by the structure of a
crystal growing furnace 200 to be described later (for
example, to optimize the temperature gradient about
the solid-liquid interface where a crucible is pulled
down, such that segregation of impurities is collected
at the top portion) , temperature control, and process
condition control (for example, the crystal growing
speed is slowed down or the vacuum application time
is prolonged), for example.</p>
    <p num="0049">The mixture of CaF2 powder and scavenger
thus obtained is then subjected to vacuum baking
process (step 1200). The vacuum baking process is
carried out to remove moisture in the mixture or any
other absorbed matters therein, by heating the mixture .
The vacuum baking process at step 1200 is performed
before a refining process (step 1300) , to be described
later, and as a separate process from the refining step.
Here, the other absorbed matters may include organic
contaminants inherently contained in the atmosphere,
mainly, mist (oil) and the like. A vacuum baking 
process is performed also at step 1400, but the process
at step 1200 absorbs a larger amount of moisture as
compared with the process at step 1400, and thus the
effect of moisture removal is larger.</p>
    <p num="0050">In the vacuum baking process, initially,
the mixture 320 is put into a crucible 304 made from
a porous carbon material, and it is loaded on a mesh
table 310 in a vacuum chamber 302 of a vacuum baking
furnace 300 shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 is schematic
and sectional view of the vacuum baking furnace 300.
Thus, in this embodiment, the mixture 320 of CaF2 raw
material and scavenger is heated together with the
crucible 304. In place of using the vacuum baking
furnace 300, the mixture 320 may be heated by using
a refining furnace 100 which is used in the refining
process (step 1300) to be described later. Namely,
in the latter case, the refining furnace 100 shown in
Figure 2 functions in the refining process and also
in the vacuum baking process. Generally, however, the
refining furnace 100 is more expensive than an
all-purpose vacuum baking chamber 100 and,
additionally, from the standpoint of keeping the time
for the refining process through the refining furnace
100, using separate furnaces as in this embodiment will
be preferable.</p>
    <p num="0051">In the vacuum baking furnace 300, the
inside space of the vacuum chamber 302 is defined by 
the mesh table 310 and the heat insulating material
308. It is heat insulated by the insulating material
308, and a vacuum ambience or a reduced pressure
ambience is kept therein through a dry pump 330. The
mesh table 320 can be heated by a heater 306. Within
the inside space of the vacuum chamber 302, a nozzle
connected to a gas supplying mechanism (not shown) may
be provided to supply into the chamber an inert or
inactive gas such as nitrogen, helium, argon, neon,
krypton, xenon, for example, for promoting moisture
removal, such that a gas flow environment may be
provided therein. This is to assure that the number
of gas molecules is increased in a reduced pressure
ambience, to thereby accelerate removal of moisture
molecules and other absorbed contaminants. In the
vacuum baking chamber 300, the dry pump 330 evacuates
the chamber 302 to a vacuum level of about 10Pa, and
the heater 306 heats it to about 150 - 200 °C to remove
the moisture and inactive gas.</p>
    <p num="0052">After the vacuum baking process is
completed, a refining process is performed to the
mixture (step 1300). The refining process is a
process for removing impurities such as carbonic acid,
for example, to thereby raise the purity of CaF2. It
may include dehydration, removal of absorbed
contaminants, scavenge reaction, removal of scavenger
product, removal of residual scavenger, fusing, and 
solidification. In the refining process, the mixture
120 is put into a crucible 104 placed in the refining
furnace 100 shown in Figure 2.</p>
    <p num="0053">In Figure 2, denoted at 102 is a chamber
for the refining furnace 100. It is connected to a
vacuum exhaust system which comprises a rotary pump
150, a mechanical booster pump 160, a turbo molecular
pump 170, and a toxic substance arresting (trap) system
180. Exhaust pumps at 150- 170 are not limited to
these types of pumps. The arresting (trap) system 180
may comprise a cooling trap for cooling an exhaust gas
to separate and remove toxic substances in the exhaust
gas or a high-temperature trap for thermally
decomposing the exhaust gas, for example.</p>
    <p num="0054">The chamber 120 is thermally insulated by
a heat insulating material 108, and it accommodates
a crucible 104 and a heater 106 therein. For example,
the crucible 104 is made of carbon and has an
approximately cylindrical shape. It is rotatably
supported by a crucible supporting and pull-down
mechanism 140. The crucible supporting and pull-down
mechanism 140 is arranged so that the crucible 104 is
descended as required. Rotation by the crucible
supporting and pull-down mechanism 140 is carried out
so as to make the crucible 104 temperature uniform.
In this embodiment, one and the same crucible is used
as the crucible 104 and the crucible 302 inside the 
vacuum baking furnace shown in Figure 5. However,
separate crucibles may be used (that is, the mixture
inside the crucible 304 is transferred into the
crucible 104). The chamber 102 is connected also to
a cooling pipe 130 for temperature adjustment. Thus,
by means of the heater 106 and the cooling pipe 130,
the temperature inside the chamber 102 can be
controlled. Thermocouple 110 is made from platinum,
for example, and it functions to measure the
temperature of the crucible 104, from about the outside
wall of the crucible 104.</p>
    <p num="0055">Subsequently, the heater 106 is energized
to heat the mixture 120 inside the crucible 104,
whereby removal of moisture and other absorbed matters
is performed. As described, while dehydration is
carried out also during the refining process at step
1300, the vacuum baking process at steps 1200 and 1400
is a process separate from the refining process. The
refining furnace 100 is vacuum evacuated by means of
the vacuum exhaust system, and a vacuum level not less
than 1x10<sup>-3</sup> Pa is established therein.</p>
    <p num="0056">Subsequently, through a temperature
change from 350 °C to 1100 °C which is a temperature
region for the scavenge reaction, the CaF2 raw material
is completely fused.</p>
    <p num="0057">After the fusing, in order to remove any
residual toxic elements, the material in fused state 
is held for a few hours to several ten hours.</p>
    <p num="0058">Subsequently, the crucible 104 is
descended to gradually cool the fused CaF2 material
to cause crystal growth. Since there is no necessity
of putting the lattice disposition of CaF2 crystal in
order, the descending speed of the crucible should not
always be slow. Although the present invention
includes a case wherein the crucible 104 is not
descended, by descending the crucible 104, the effect
of impurity removal is enhanced. This process does
not need precise temperature control as being made in
the monocrystal growing process (step 1500), to be
described later. Therefore, the crystal obtained by
this process may be one including a particle phase.
Of the crystal thus obtained, particularly a top
portion, that is, the portion having been crystallized
last with respect to time, is removed. Since many
impurities are collected in this portion (that is,
segregation occurs there) , by removing it, impurities
that may adversely affect the characteristic can be
removed effectively. After that, the crystal is put
into the crucible 104 again, and then, sequential
operations of fusing, crystallization, and removing
the top portion, is repeated plural times. If
necessary, an inert or inactive gas may be introduced
into the chamber 102.</p>
    <p num="0059">Subsequently, a vacuum baking process is 
carried out to the refined CaF2 crystal (step 1400).
The vacuum baking process is performed to heat the
mixture, thereby to remove any moisture still
remaining in the CaF2 crystal. The vacuum baking
process at step 1400 is carried out after the refining
process at step 1300, and as a separate process from
the refining process. In this embodiment, the vacuum
baking furnace 300 shown in Figure 5 is used to remove
moisture as has been described with reference to Figure
5. Alternatively, the refining furnace 100 or a
crystal growing furnace 200 to be described later may
be used. Generally, however, the refining furnace 100
and the crystal growing furnace 200 are more expensive
than an all-purpose vacuum baking chamber 300 and,
additionally, from the standpoint of keeping the time
for the refining process through the refining furnace
100 and the crystal growth through the crystal growing
furnace 200, using separate furnaces as in this
embodiment will be preferable.</p>
    <p num="0060">After the vacuum baking process, a
monocrystal growing process is performed to the
mixture (step 1500). The monocrystal growing process
is a process for causing growth of monocrystal of CaF2
to improve the quality of the crystal, that is, to put
the lattice disposition in order. The growing method
may be chosen appropriately, in accordance with the
size of crystal and the purpose of use, for example. 
The refined crystal 220 is put into a crucible 204 which
is accommodated in a chamber 202 of the crystal growing
furnace 200 shown in Figure 3.</p>
    <p num="0061">In Figure 3, denoted at 202 is a chamber
for the crystal growing furnace 200. It is connected
to a vacuum exhaust system which comprises a rotary
pump 250, a mechanical booster pump 260, a turbo
molecular pump 270, and a toxic substance arresting
system 280. The chamber 202 is thermally insulated
by a heat insulating material 208, and it accommodates
a crucible 204 and a heater 206 therein. For example,
the crucible 204 is made of carbon and has an
approximately cylindrical shape, and it has a good
sealing tightness. The crucible 204 is supported by
a crucible supporting and pull-down mechanism 240, for
rotation and for upward and downward motion. Rotation
by the crucible supporting and pull-down mechanism 240
is carried out so as to make the crucible 204
temperature uniform. In this embodiment, one and the
same crucible is used as the crucible 204 and the
crucible 310 inside the vacuum baking furnace shown
in Figure 5. However, separate crucibles may be used
(that is, the mixture inside the crucible 304 is
transferred into the crucible 204). The chamber 202
is connected also to a cooling pipe 230 for temperature
adjustment. Thus, by means of the heater 206 and the
cooling pipe 230, a desired temperature gradient can 
be produced with respect to vertical direction shown
in Figure 3. Thermocouple 210 is made from platinum,
for example, and it functions to measure the
temperature of the crucible 204, from about the outside
wall of the crucible 204. It is to be noted here that,
although a scavenger is added also in the growth step
(for example, not less than 0.0005 mol% and not greater
than 0.05 mol%), the amount of addition can be made
much less than in a case where the vacuum baking process
(steps 1200 and 1400) is not included. Thus,
impurities and crystal defect (particularly,
transition density) contained in the crystal can be
decreased.</p>
    <p num="0062">Subsequently, the heater 206 is energized
to heat the CaF2 secondary raw material (crystal)
inside the crucible 204 to about 1420 °C so that the
CaF2 crystal is fused completely. After that, the
crucible 204 is descended gradually at a speed 2 mm/h
(to pass the same through a predetermined temperature
gradient), to gradually cool the fused CaF2 crystal
and cause crystal growth.</p>
    <p num="0063">Subsequently, the thus crystal-grown
fluoride monocrystal is heat-treated in an annealing
furnace shown in Figure 4 (i.e., annealing process at
step 1600). The annealing process is a process for
thermally treat the grown CaF2 monocrystal to thereby
remove any distortion which might cause crack of 
crystal. The grown monocrystal 420 is put into a
crucible 404 which is accommodated in a chamber 402
of the annealing furnace 400 shown in Figure 4.</p>
    <p num="0064">In Figure 4, denoted at 402 is a chamber
for the annealing furnace 400. It is connected to a
vacuum exhaust system which comprises a rotary pump
460 , a mechanical booster pump 470, a turbo molecular
pump 480, and a toxic substance arresting system 490.
The chamber 402 is thermally insulated by a heat
insulating material 408, and it accommodates a
crucible 404 and a heater 406 therein. For example,
the crucible 404 is made of carbon and has an
approximately cylindrical shape, being formed with
multiple stages. The crucible 404 is supported by a
crucible supporting member 440. The chamber 402 is
connected also to a cooling pipe 430 for temperature
adjustment. Thus, by means of the heater 406 and the
cooling pipe 430, the temperature of the chamber 402
can be controlled. Thermocouple 410 is made from
platinum, for example, and it functions to measure the
temperature of the crucible 404, from about the outside
wall of the crucible 404.</p>
    <p num="0065">In the annealing process, the crucible 404
is heated to about 900 - 1000 °C uniformly, to thereby
remove distortion of the CaF2 crystal as it is kept
in a solid state. If the heating temperature, is made
not less than about 1140 °C, it undesirably causes a 
structural change, for example. The heating time is
not less than about 2 hours, more preferably, about
20 - 30 hours. In the annealing process, due to the
annealing, the crystal transition decreases. After
that, while keeping the state having no distortion, the
temperature of the CaF2 crystal is returned to the room
temperature. Although a scavenger is added also in
the annealing process,since the temperature in the
annealing process is about 1000 °C and no fusion occurs,
the amount of scavenger addition can be very small such
as not less than 0.0005 mol% and not greater than 0.05
mol%. For example, it ma be 0.001 mol%.</p>
    <p num="0066">In the embodiment described above, changes
in bulk density before and after the growth can be made
vary small as compared with those in conventional
methods, such that the bulk density in the growing
furnace 200 can be raised.</p>
    <p num="0067">Also, in the embodiment described above,
the vacuum baking process is performed twice, before
and after the refining process. However, as a matter
of course, only either one may be carried out.</p>
    <p num="0068">The spectral transmissivity of the thus
obtained CaF2 crystal is measured and, a product having
high transmissivity (about 90%) with respect to a
wavelength 157 nm, and having a transmissivity of not
less than 70% with respect to a wavelength 130 nm is
chosen. The refractive index uniformness 
(homogeneity) is determined on the basis of
transmission wavefront and surface precision
measurement made through an interferometer, and the
birefringence index is measured by use of a high
precision distortion gauge.</p>
    <p num="0069">Subsequently, the CaF2 crystal is shaped
into a required optical element (step s1700). The
optical element may be, for example, a lens, a
diffraction grating, an optical film, and a composite
of them, that is, for example, one of a lens, a multiple
lens, a lens array, a lenticular lens, a fly's eye lens,
an aspherical lens, a diffraction grating, a binary
optics element, and a composite of them. In addition
to a single element of lens or the like, the optical
element may be a photosensor for focus control, for
example. If necessary, an antireflection film may be
provided on the surface of an optical component made
of fluoride crystal. As regards the antireflection
film, magnesium fluoride, aluminum oxide, and tantalum
oxide are suitably usable. The film can be formed by
vapor deposition through resistance heating, electron
beam deposition, or sputtering, for example. Since
an optical element produced in accordance with the
present invention has less crystal defect, the
adherence of the anti-reflection film is good. In the
polishing process for obtaining the shape required for
the optical component (for example, convex lens, 
concave lens, disk-like shape, or plate-like shape),
because of small transition density inside the CaF2
crystal, a decrease of local surface precision is very
small, such that high-precision processing is
attainable.</p>
    <p num="0070">By combining various lenses obtainable as
described above, a projection optical system or an
illumination optical system suited for use with
excimer lasers, particularly, ArF excimer laser and
F2 excimer laser, can be provided. Further, by using
an excimer laser light source, an optical system having
a lens made from CaF2 crystal produced in accordance
with the producing method of the present invention,
and a stage for moving a substrate in combination, an
exposure apparatus for photolithography can be
provided. As regards the analysis method for content
of lanthanum and yttrium, fluorescent X-ray analysis
method, ICP emission analysis method, ICP mass
analysis method and the like may be used. The analysis
of oxygen and carbon was made in accordance with
combustion method. As regards evaluation of
transition density, a (1,1,1) plane corresponding to
a cleavage plane f CaF2 crystal was formed by immersion
in 0.4N nitric acid solution, and the etch pit density
thereof was taken as the transition density of
evaluated crystal.</p>
    <p num="0071">A specific example of this embodiment will 
be described below.</p>
    <p num="0072">To a commercially available high-purity
CaF2 powder raw material of a required amount, ZnF2
as a scavenger was added by 0.1 mol% with respect to
the CaF2 raw material, and they were mixed and
dispersed uniformly. After that, the mixture was put
into a carbon crucible. Subsequently, in a vacuum
drying furnace, degasification was carried out at 150
°C and for 2 hours. Then, the material was transferred
into a refining crucible, and it was heated at 1420
°C and fused, whereby toxic unwanted elements therein
were removed. After that, the material was gradually
cooled and solidified. Toxic unwanted portion at the
surface layer of the thus obtained CaF2 block was
removed, whereby a secondary raw material prior to
crystal growth was obtained.</p>
    <p num="0073">Subsequently, the above described
material block was put into a monocrystal growing
crucible which was vacuum dried beforehand. As a
scavenger, 0.01 mol% of ZnF2 was put into the crucible.
Then, the furnace was vacuum evacuated and the crucible
was heated, so that a vacuum level of 8x10<sup>-2</sup> Pa and a
temperature 1420 °C were attained. In order to fuse
and degasify CaF2 inside the crucible, a vacuum level
of 2.6x10<sup>-4</sup> Pa and a temperature 1420 °C were held for
20 hours. Subsequently, the crucible was descended
at a speed 2 mm/h, and good quality CaF2 monocrystal 
was grown. The pull-down speed here should desirably
be one corresponding to the crystal growth speed, such
that, as a matter of course, it should be adjusted in
accordance with the size and shape of crystal to be
produced. Generally, if the size of crystal becomes
large, the pull-down speed should be made slower.</p>
    <p num="0074">Subsequently, the thus grown CaF2
monocrystal as well as ZnF2 of an addition amount 0.01
mol% with respect to the CaF2 monocrystal were put into
the annealing furnace. The furnace was exhausted, and
the temperature of the crucible was raised from the
room temperature to 900 °C at a speed 100 °C/h. After
that, it was held at about 900 °C for about 50 hours.
Then, it was cooled to the room temperature, at a speed
5 °C/h. As regards the cooling speed here, if the
crystal size is large, the cooling speed should follow
it and should be slowed down. Namely, without slowing
down, it becomes very difficult to make the
birefringence index quite small.</p>
    <p num="0075">The scavenger used throughout the whole
procedure may be LiF, NaF, CdF2, Kr and the like, and
those fluorides other than ZnF2 may be used with
similar effects.</p>

    <p num="0077">Referring now to Figure 6, an exposure
apparatus 1 according to an embodiment of the present
invention will be described. Here, Figure 6 is a
schematic and sectional view of an exposure apparatus,
as an example according to the present invention.</p>
    <p num="0078">As shown in Figure 6, the exposure
apparatus 1 comprises an illumination system 10, a
reticle 20, a projection optical system 30, a plate
40, and a stage 45. The exposure apparatus is a scan
type projection exposure apparatus in which a circuit
pattern formed on the reticle 20 is transferred to the
plate 40 in accordance with a step-and-repeat method
or a step-and-scan method.</p>
    <p num="0079">The illumination system 10 serves to
illuminate the reticle 20 having a transfer circuit
pattern formed thereon, and it includes a light source
unit 12 and an illumination optical system 14.</p>
    <p num="0080">The light source unit 12 may comprise a
laser, for example, as a light source. The laser may
be ArF excimer laser having a wavelength of about 193
nm, KrF excimer laser having a wavelength of about 248
nm, or F2 excimer laser having a wavelength of about
153 nm, for example. The type of laser is not limited
to excimer laser. For example, YAG laser may be used.
Also, the number of lasers is not limited. Where a
laser is used in the light source unit 12, a beam
shaping optical system for transforming parallel light 
from the laser light source into a desired beam shape,
as well as an incoherency transforming optical system
for transforming coherent laser light into incoherent
light, may desirably be used. However, the light
source usable in the light source unit 12 is not limited
to laser. One or plural lamps such as Hg lamp or xenon
lamp may be used.</p>
    <p num="0081">The illumination optical system 14 is an
optical system for illuminating the mask 20. It
includes a lens, a mirror, a light integrator, a stop
and the like. For example, a condenser lens, a fly's
eye lens, an aperture stop, a condenser lens, a slit,
and an imaging optical system may be provided in this
order. The illumination optical system 14 can be used
with either axial light or abaxial light. The light
integrator may comprise an integrator such as a fly's
eye lens or combined two sets of cylindrical lens array
(or lenticular lens) plates. Alternatively, it may
be replaced by an optical rod or diffractive element.
An optical element produced in accordance with the
present invention can be used as optical elements such
as lenses in this illumination optical system 14.</p>
    <p num="0082">The reticle is made of quartz, for example,
and it has formed thereon a circuit pattern (or image)
to be transferred. The reticle is supported and moved
by a reticle stage, not shown. Diffraction light from
the reticle 20 goes through the projection optical 
system 30, and it is projected on the plate 40. The
plate 40 may be a workpiece such as a wafer or a liquid
crystal substrate, and it is coated with a resist
material. The reticle 20 and the plate 40 are placed
in an optically conjugate relation with each other.
Where the exposure apparatus is scan type projection
exposure apparatus, the mask 20 and the plate 40 are
scanningly moved, by which the pattern of the mask 20
is transferred to the plate 40. If the exposure
apparatus is a step-and-repeat type exposure apparatus
(stepper) , the exposure process is performed while the
mask 20 and the plate 40 are held fixed.</p>
    <p num="0083">The projection optical system 30 may be an
optical system consisting lens elements only, an
optical system (catadioptric system) having lens
elements and at least one concave mirror, an optical
system having lens elements and at least one
diffractive optical element such as kinoform, for
example, or an all-mirror type optical system, for
example. If correction of chromatic aberration is
necessary, lens elements made of glass materials
having different dispersions (Abbe's numbers), or
alternatively, a diffractive optical element may be
provided so as to produce dispersion in opposite
direction to lens elements. An optical element
produced in accordance with the present invention can
be used as optical elements such as lenses in the 
projection optical system 30.</p>
    <p num="0084">The plate 40 is coated with a photoresist.
The photoresist coating process includes a pre-process,
an adherence enhancing agent coating process, a
photoresist coating process, and a pre-baking process.
The pre-process includes washing, drying and the like.
The adherence enhancing agent coating process is a
surface improving process (i.e., hydrophobing
treatment based on coating with a surface active agent)
for improving the adherence between the photoresist
and the ground material. In this process, an organic
film such as HMDS (Hexamethyl-disilazane), for example,
is applied by coating or vapor treatment. The
pre-baking is a baking (firing) treatment, but it is
gentle as compared with that to be done after the
development. It is to remove any solvent.</p>
    <p num="0085">The stage 45 supports the plate 40. Since
any structure known in the art can be used for the stage
45, detailed description of the structure and function
of it will be omitted. For example, linear motors may
be used in the stage 45 to move the plate 40 in X and
Y directions. The reticle 20 and the plate 40 may be
scanningly moved in synchronism with each other, for
example. The position of the stage 45 and the position
of a reticle stage (not shown) may be monitored by use
of laser interferometers, for example, and these
stages may be driven at a constant speed ratio. The 
stage 45 may be provided, for example, on a stage base
which is supported by the floor, or the like, through
dampers. The reticle stage and the projection optical
system 40 may be provided on a barrel base (not shown)
which is supported by a base frame, mounted on the floor,
for example, through dampers or the like.</p>
    <p num="0086">In the exposure process, light emitted
from the light source unit 12 illuminates the reticle
20, in Koehler illumination, for example, through the
illumination optical system 14. The light passing
through the reticle 20 and reflecting the mask pattern
is imaged on the plate 40 by the projection optical
system 30. The illumination optical system 14 and the
projection optical system 30 used in the exposure
apparatus may include optical elements produced in
accordance with the present invention, so that each
can transmit ultraviolet light, deep ultraviolet light
or vacuum ultraviolet light at a high transmissivity.
Additionally, because of good refractive index
homogeneity and small birefringence, devices such as
semiconductor devices, LCD devices, image pickup
devices (e.g., CCD) or thin magnetic heads, for example,
can be produced at a higher resolution and a higher
throughput, and economically.</p>
    <p num="0087">Next, referring to Figures 7 and 8, an
embodiment of a device manufacturing method which uses
an exposure apparatus such as described above, will 
be explained.</p>
    <p num="0088">Figure 7 is a flow chart for explaining the
procedure of manufacturing various microdevices such
as semiconductor chips (e.g., ICs or LSIs), liquid
crystal panels, or CCDs, for example. Step 1 is a
design process for designing a circuit of a
semiconductor device. Step 2 is a process for making
a mask on the basis of the circuit pattern design. Step
3 is a process for preparing a wafer by using a material
such as silicon. Step 4 is a wafer process which is
called a pre-process wherein, by using the thus
prepared mask and wafer, a circuit is formed on the
wafer in practice, in accordance with lithography.
Step 5 subsequent to this is an assembling step which
is called a post-process wherein the wafer having been
processed at step 4 is formed into semiconductor chips.
This step includes an assembling (dicing and bonding)
process and a packaging (chip sealing) process. Step
6 is an inspection step wherein an operation check,
a durability check and so on, for the semiconductor
devices produced by step 5, are carried out. With
these processes, semiconductor devices are produced,
and they are shipped (step 7).</p>
    <p num="0089">Figure 8 is a flow chart for explaining

process for oxidizing the surface of a wafer. Step
12 is a CVD process for forming an insulating film on 
the wafer surface. Step 13 is an electrode forming
process for forming electrodes upon the wafer by vapor
deposition. Step 14 is an ion implanting process for
implanting ions to the wafer. Step 15 is a resist
process for applying a resist (photosensitive
material) to the wafer. Step 16 is an exposure process
for printing, by exposure, the circuit pattern of the
mask on the wafer through the exposure apparatus
described above. Step 17 is a developing process for
developing the exposed wafer. Step 18 is an etching
process for removing portions other than the developed
resist image. Step 19 is a resist separation process
for separating the resist material remaining on the
wafer after being subjected to the etching process.
By repeating these processes, circuit patterns are
superposedly formed on the wafer.</p>
    <p num="0090">With these processes, high quality
microdevices can be manufactured.</p>
    <p num="0091">Although some embodiments and examples of
the present invention have been described above, the
present invention is not limited to the disclosed form.
Various modifications are possible within the scope
of the invention.</p>
    <p num="0092">In accordance with the embodiments of the
present invention as described hereinbefore, removal
of moisture and other absorbed materials of the raw
material and a crucible to be used, other than 
degasification in a refining furnace and a growing
furnace, is carried out beforehand as a separate
process. This effectively minimizes the amount of
moisture and other absorbed substances introduced into
the furnace, thereby to prevent production of crystal
defect. As a result of it, the transition density
inside the crystal is decreased, and thus dispersion
of transition density inside the crystal is reduced.
Consequently, the CaF2 crystal of the present
invention can accomplish good refractive index
uniformness (homogeneity) as well as small
birefringence index. Further, due to decrease of
moisture, oxidation prevention can be accomplished
only by use of a small amount of scavenger addition.
Therefore, the adverse influence of residual scavenger
to the optical characteristics of the crystal is
reduced considerably. The internal transmissivity
and the laser durability are improved. Thus, the
present invention can provide CaF2 crystal by which,
even if it is irradiated with light having a short
wavelength and a large power, repeatedly for a long
term, the transmissivity characteristic is not
deteriorated easily.</p>
    <p num="0093">As described above, the present invention
can provide a CaF2 crystal which is particularly
suitably usable as an optical component for use with
an excimer laser, more particularly, an optical 
component for excimer laser to be used in an exposure
apparatus for photolithography. Also, the present
invention can provide a CaF2 crystal to be used as an
optical component having a good imaging performance
and a good reliability.</p>
    <p num="0094">In summary, the present invention can
provide a calcium fluoride crystal having superior
optical characteristics, as well as a method and
apparatus for producing the same. Further, an optical
element produced from such calcium fluoride can be used
in an optical system of an exposure apparatus, by which
an exposure process of good resolution and good
throughput can be accomplished and high quality
devices can be produced thereby.</p>
    <p num="0095">While the invention has been described
with reference to the structures disclosed herein, it
is not confined to the details set forth and this
application is intended to cover such modifications
or changes as may come within the purposes of the
improvements or the scope of the following claims.</p>
