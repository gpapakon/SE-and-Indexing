    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to an auxiliary-handle fixture for a modular
headliner of an automobile, and more particularly to a new auxiliary-handle
fixture for a module type headliner of an automobile which enables an easy
mounting and nevertheless guarantees a firm securement of accessaries against
loosening or detachment after mounting.</p>
    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0002">Generally, a plurality of auxiliary handles are provided on upper positions
of both sides inside an automobile for passengers to grip, wherein these handles
are positioned inside the car, particularly at inner side of a headliner and fixed
on a body panel through certain fixtures.</p>
    <p num="0003">Conventionally, automobile manufactures installed the auxiliary handles on
body panels one by one after attaching headliners on the inside of cars. Because
this method adds to the burden of increasing assembling process for car
manufactures, in recent years a modular method is employed, wherein when car
manufacturers receive headliners already attached with the above-described
auxiliary handles made by cooperating companies, the car manufacturers install
them on body panels in a one-touch manner.</p>
    <p num="0004">As a representative form of auxiliary-handle fixtures used in such a
modular method is shown in Figures 1 and 2, those fixtures are formed of metal
panels cut in predetermined form followed by bending, wherein in the base area,
there are provided base portion 50 positioned between the body panel 10 and 
the headliner 20 and in the front or tip portion, there are provided hook portion
51 integrally bent from the base portion 50 and fitted in the holes 15 of the
body panel 10. When the hooks 51, which are each provided, on respective
opposite sides, with wedge-formed supporting pieces 53 spreading toward the
base portion 50 from the tip portion, are inserted in the holes 15 of the body
panel 10, the supporting pieces 53, in a compressed state, are coupled in the
holes 15 of the body panel 10 and subsequently expanded by their own
elasticity to engage with the body panel 10 for securement. As shown in
Figures, however, in order to help the fixtures 5 coupled in the holes 15 of the
body panel 10 to be secured and prevented from play, the supporting pieces 53
are provided, on the end parts, with bending portion 54, which are so formed as
to be bent inwardly up to the free ends.</p>
    <p num="0005">However, the fixtures of this type are associated with the problem that
the supporting pieces 53 tend to experience a play as the bending portion 54 get
flat or contracted, or even can come off the body panel 10 in extreme cases,
when the auxiliary handles 30 connected to fixtures 5 are pulled, because the
fixtures 5 are so secured that the bending portion 54 of supporting pieces 53 are
tightly held against the inner circumferential surfaces of holes 15 in the body
panel 10 but in a somewhat collapsable manner.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0006">The present invention is intended to resolve the above-described problem
and thus the object of the invention is to provide a new auxiliary-handle fixture
for module type headliner of an automobile which enables an easy mounting and
nevertheless guarantees a firm securement of the handle against loosening or
detachment after mounting. </p>
    <p num="0007">The above-described object is achieved according to an aspect of the
invention by an auxiliary-handle fixture for a modular headliner of automobile,
mounted in a coupling hole 15 of the body panel 10 for fixing an auxiliary
handle 30 positioned inside a headliner 20, comprising a body 5 having a
central threaded hole 48, a plurality of elastic coupling pieces 40 extending
outwardly from the front portion of the body 5 in a spreading manner to the
base portion of the body 5 and capable of contacting, with their ends, to the
outer surface of the body panel 10 after insertion through the coupling hole 15,
and a plurality of supporting pieces 45 bent at the base portion of the body 5
to extend outwardly toward the front portion of the body 5 to thereby elastically
bear on the inside surface of the body panel 10 after mounting, wherein in
assembling on the body panel 10, the ends of the coupling pieces 40 interfere
with the outside surface of the body panel 10 for firm fixing and the end
portions of the supporting pieces 45 elastically bear on the inner surface of the
body panel 10 for prevention from play.</p>
    <p num="0008">Preferably, the coupling pieces 40 and supporting pieces 45 are radially
arranged around the central threaded hole 48 of the body 5 at predetermined
circumferential angle and each pair of the coupling pieces 40 and supporting
pieces 45 is arranged overlapped in view of the axial direction of the threaded
hole 48.</p>
    <p num="0009">Preferably, each pair of the coupling pieces 40 and supporting pieces 45
are disposed in opposite direction of the central threaded hole 48 of the body 5.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0011">A preferred embodiment of the present invention is described in detail
below by referring to accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="0012">Referring to Figures 3 and 4, which show respectively a perspective and
cross sectional views of an auxiliary-handle fixture in an automobile according to
the invention, the auxiliarly-handle fixture 4 for an automobile are provided
with a body 5 having a central threaded hole 48, a plurality of elastic coupling
pieces 40 extending outwardly and downwardly or toward the base portion of
the body 4, wherein a plurality of supporting pieces 45 bent in the direction of
outside tip are integrally formed in the base portion of the body 5.</p>
    <p num="0013">The fixture 4, which is made by bending and forming a thin metal panel
cut in the predetermined form, is formed with a threaded hole 48 on its front
center of the body 5, around which three coupling pieces 40 in the front portion
and three supporting pieces 45 in the base portion are formed radially at a
respective interval of 120° . Specifically, each pair of respective coupling pieces
40 and supporting pieces 45 are so arranged that they are overlapped in view of
the axial direction of the threaded hole 48. When the fixture of the invention is 
inserted into the coupling hole 15 of the body panel 10, they are respectively
interfered with the outer and inner surfaces of the body panel 10 to thereby be
fixed.</p>
    <p num="0014">Further, the supporting pieces 45 are formed by the steps of bending a
metal panel cut in the form of three-leaved clover around the threaded hole 48
to form a substantially cylindrical form and then bending the bent extensions 44
at about their central positions outwardly in radial direction. In addition, the bent
extensions 44 are cut out from their front areas in a substantial U form to
produce coupling pieces, which are bent to spread radially and outwardly toward
the free ends, so that the coupling pieces 40 may result. Preferably, the coupling
pieces 40 are formed, on radially inward side, with reinforcing profiles 41 to
reinforce the coupling pieces against radial force acting thereon.</p>
    <p num="0015">Accordingly, when a cooperating company supplies pre-assemblies which
resulted by positioning auxiliary handles 30 inside the headliner 20 and
screw-connecting the resulting assembly, through the threaded holes 48, to the
fixtures 4 positioned outside the headliner 20, the car manufacturer inserts the
fixtures 4 positioned outside the headliner 20 in the coupling holes 15 in the
body panel 10 in one-touch method, so that the headliner 20 and auxiliary
handles 30 may be simultaneously assembled to the body panel 10.</p>
    <p num="0016">In this process, the plural coupling pieces 40 which normally extend
from the front portion of the fixtures 4 outwardly to the side of the base
portion can be inserted through the coupling holes 15 by elastically compressing
them in radially inward direction and after insertion, are elastically expanded
radially with compressing force relieved to collide, with the free ends, against
the outside surface of the body panel 10 for assured fixing.</p>
    <p num="0017">On the other hand, the supporting pieces 45 which are provided on the 
base portion of fixtures 4 so as to expand outwardly toward the front tip side
are to contact the inside surface of the body panel 10 and maintain coupled
state with more or less elastic deformation, once the coupling pieces 40 have
passed the coupling holes 15.</p>
    <p num="0018">Therefore, even when man jerks down an auxiliary handles 30, it does
not fall off the hole 15 of body panel 10, because the downward movement of
the coupling pieces 40 of the fixture 4 is engaged with the body panel 10. The
coupling strength of the coupling pieces 40 with the body panel 10 is uniform
to any directional force acting on, as they are arranged radially around the
central threaded hole 48 at an equal spacing of 120° .</p>
    <p num="0019">Moreover, fixtures 4 can be easily inserted through the coupling holes 15
of the body panel 10 in an assembling process, as the coupling pieces 40 in the
base portion are elastically deformable. Further, when the coupling pieces 40
have completely fitted in coupling holes 15, the coupling pieces tend to expand
radially outwardly due to their own elasticity, with the result that workers can
detect imperfect couplings to prevent defective assembly.</p>
    <p num="0020">In addition, the fixtures 4 are further prevented from any play when
mounted, as they are each provided, in their base portion, with supporting pieces
45 which bear elastically on the inside surface of the body panel 10. And,
each pair of coupling pieces 40 and supporting pieces 45 is arranged overlapped
in view of the axial direction of screw 33, so that twisting are prevented even
in the case of high stresses in supporting pieces 45.</p>
    <p num="0021">Figure 5 shows another embodiment of the invention. where each pair of
the coupling pieces 40 and supporting pieces 45 are disposed in opposite
direction of the central threaded hole 48 of the body 5. And, the coupling hole
15 of body panel 10 have an elongated form. In this case, the fixture can be 
inserted and adjusted along the elongated coupling hole 15 of the body panel
10. Therefore, the fixture can be easily assembled by adjusting the position of it
along the elongated hole 15 of the body panel 10 even though there are some
dimensional incorrectness of parts.</p>
