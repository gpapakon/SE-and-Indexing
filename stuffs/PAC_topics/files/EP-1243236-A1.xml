    <p>This suction ring is composed of a ring-shaped body (1) with an incarcerated,
bevelled front opening (2), with an anterolateral cannula (4) for connection to a
vacuum pump and a dovetail guide (7) on which the microkeratome cutting blade
moves. The lateral wall of the body (1) has a tapered truncated conical
configuration, diverging backwards for adaptation to the eyeball, in order to
increase the suction capacity to the eye. The front area has a wider stepped
perimeter (6), which together with a bulge (8) on the outer edge and
corresponding to the tips of the guide (7), increases the effective length of the
latter, allowing better fixation of the cutting blade.

    <heading>
      <b>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention refers to a suction ring which uses the depression
generated by a vacuum pump connected through a flexible pipe to fix itself to the
eyeball and thereby function as the support and guide for the microkeratome
cutting blade.</p>
    <p num="0002">The object of the invention is to improve the ring's capacity to stick to the
eyeball and improve the connection of the cutting blade to the suction ring itself.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0003">The entity applying in this case is actually the holder of the Invention
Patent with Application No. 9801787 which describes a microkeratome which,
among other elements that are not presently of interest, includes a suction ring
with a cylindrical outer wall, with a partially incarcerated and bevelled upper
opening, with a frontal and lateral cannula for connection, after being fitted to the
eyeball, to the vacuum source that will ensure that the said ring may remain
perfectly stable on the eyeball while the cutting blade works upon the cornea.</p>
    <p num="0004">Furthermore, the aforementioned ring also has a dovetail guide at the front,
for the longitudinal displacement of the cutting blade whose base is configured
according to the said guide. </p>
    <p num="0005">Moreover, this is the usual configuration of all known suction rings for
microkeratomes to date.</p>
    <p num="0006">Obviously, the extent to which the suction ring is attached to the eyeball
depends on the extent to which both elements, ring and eyeball, are adapted to
each other. Similarly, the stability of the cutting blade on the said ring also
depends on the connection length between the tracks of the suction ring and the
cutting blade.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0007">The suction ring proposed in the present invention has been conceived and
structured with a view to enhancing the two aforementioned aspects, i.e. to
improving the ring's capacity to attach itself to the eyeball and to improving the
connection between the cutting blade and the dovetail on the suction ring.</p>
    <p num="0008">To this end, in practice and according to the characteristics of the invention,
it has been decided that the side wall of the ring, instead of the classical
cylindrical configuration, should have a truncated conical shape, diverging
towards the side that is to be attached to the eyeball. This means there is a greater
surface of the aforementioned ring in contact with the eyeball and therefore a
higher level of fixation between these elements.</p>
    <p num="0009">In accordance with another of the characteristics of the invention, it has
been decided that the ring shall include, on its front edge, a perimeter expansion
that will increase the surface of the front side. At the same time, the perimeter of
the front and the protruding side shall bulge over the tips of the grooves or scores
of the dovetail guide. This shall in turn mean that the magnitude of the sectors of
the guides, i.e. the sectors of the ring and the blade that are interconnected at any 
given time, shall also be widened. Therefore the stability of the cutting blade on
the suction ring will be substantially enhanced.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0010">In order to complement the description that is being made and with the aim
of allowing a better understanding of the characteristics of the invention,
according to an example of the preferred embodiment of same, we include a set of
drawings of an illustrative and non-restrictive nature, representing the following:
<sl><li>Figure No. 1.- Shows a perspective view of a traditional suction ring for
microkeratomes.</li><li>Figure No. 2.- Shows, in a similar view to Figure 1, a ring made in
accordance with the object of the present invention, exaggerating its shape so as to
allow the reader to contrast clearly and visually the effects achieved by the
aforementioned shape.</li><li>Figure No. 3.- Shows a ground view of a traditional ring.</li><li>Figure No. 4.- Shows a similar view as in the previous figure, but of the
ring that is the object of the present invention, also exaggerating its shape in order
to show clearly the effects achieved by same.</li><li>Figure No. 5.- Shows a side elevation of a specific practical embodiment
of a suction ring for microkeratomes in accordance with the invention.</li><li>Figure No. 6. - Shows a ground view of the previous figure. </li><li>Figure No. 7.- Shows, finally, a side elevation and diameter section of the
ring shown in Figure 5, from a viewpoint that is displaced 90° with respect to the
aforementioned figure.</li></sl></p>
    <heading>
      <b>PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0011">In view of the figures described and particularly of figures 5 to 7, we can
see that the suction ring proposed by the present invention is composed, as is the
case with any conventional ring, of a pipe (1) whose front opening (2) is
noticeably incarcerated, with an inner bevel (3) allowing it to be attached to the
front of the eyeball, whereas this pipe (1) has a cannula (4) to connect it, by means
of a flexible tube, to a vacuum pump.</p>
    <p num="0012">As regards the invention itself, the side wall of the body (1) has a truncated
conical configuration, noticeably diverging towards the posterior edge of the ring,
which is to be attached to the eyeball, as we can see in Figure No. 7. Therefore, as
it is obvious if we compare Figures 1 and 2, while a conventional ring (1') has a
trimming (5) that rests on the eyeball, the ring (1) that is presently proposed rests
on the eyeball by means of an edge immediately adjacent to the aforementioned
posterior edge. As we have explained before, and as it is obvious, this improves its
adaptation and its capacity to attach itself to the eyeball.</p>
    <p num="0013">Furthermore, it has also been decided that the body (1) shall include on its
front edge, which corresponds to the incarcerated outlet (2), a perimeter stepped
expansion (6), that increases the exterior perimeter of the frontal base of the body
(1) and which, consequently, increases the length of the classical dovetail guide
(7) on which the cutting blade of the microkeratome moves, as represented in the
drawings. </p>
    <p num="0014">Also with the aim of enhancing the length of the dovetail guide (7), it has
been decided that the exterior perimeter of the front base of the body or ring (1),
instead of adopting the traditional circular configuration shown in figure 3, shall
present exterior bulges (8) corresponding to the tips of the aforementioned guide
(7), which determine an irregular configuration for this perimeter, which also
widens the said guides (7), as emerges from the schematic exploded representation
in figure 4.</p>
    <p num="0015">Therefore, given that the length of the tracks connecting both the suction
ring and the cutting blade is increased, it is possible to achieve the objectives of
the invention, i.e. on the one hand, to improve the attachment of the suction ring to
the eyeball and on the other, to improve the working conditions of the cutting
blade on the ring, and consequently, on the eyeball.</p>

  <claims load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <claim num="1">
      <claim-text>Suction ring for microkeratomes, of the type composed of a ringshaped
body, with a noticeably incarcerated front opening that is attached to the
eyeball, with an anterolateral cannula for connection by means of a flexible tube
to a vacuum pump and with a dovetail guide on the front, along which the cutting
blade moves, characterised by the fact that the side of the body (1) adopts a
truncated conical configuration diverging towards the posterior area which is
attached to the eyeball, in order to enhance the contact surface with the latter in
the aforementioned posterior area.</claim-text>
    </claim>
    <claim num="2">
      <claim-text>Suction ring for microkeratomes, according to claim no. 1,
characterised by the fact that the body (1) has a stepped expansion (6) on its front
edge or area, meaning an increase in its outer perimeter which in turn means the
dovetail guide is widened (7).</claim-text>
    </claim>
    <claim num="3">
      <claim-text>Suction ring for microkeratomes, according to the previous claims,
characterised by the fact that the body (1), presents on the front area,
corresponding to the perimeter stepped expansion (6), exterior bulges (8)
corresponding to the tips of the guide (7), which mean complementary widening
of the effective length of the aforementioned guide.</claim-text>
