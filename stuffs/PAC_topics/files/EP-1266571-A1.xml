      <u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0006">Disinfecting instruments for hospital use involves a
key factor for the control of hospital infections. There
are several methods and products used to perform said
disinfecting. A review of the main methods and disinfecting
products for hospital use, together with their indications
and risks may be found in the tenth edition of the book by
Piedrola Gil, "Medicina Preventiva y Salud Pública"
(Preventive Medicine and Public Health), Ed Masson
(Barcelona), in Chapter 37, pages 413-424, written by
Herruzo Cabrera et al. </p>
    <p num="0007">This chapter shows the advantages and drawbacks of 2%
glutaraldehyde, the reference disinfectant and the need of
finding a suitable alternative for it, since its toxicity
makes it a problem for the users and even for patients, if
the disinfected material is not thoroughly rinsed. An
alternative may be the combination of lactic acid to
hydrogen peroxide, since it combines non-toxicity to a wide
microbicidal capacity. This was the object of patent
PCT/ES98/00151, in whose claims includes 3-6% hydrogen
peroxide, 5-15% lactic acid and combined with the previous
mixture, a compound selected from 0.4-5% chlorhexidine or
0.1-3% lauryl sulphate of an alkaline metal and water as a
balance, where all the percentages are with respect to the
total composition. However, this compound is very acid,
which may involve a problem for its use, and if its
components are reduced by dilution, its disinfecting power
is lost, so that it is necessary to reinforce this activity
and reduce its acidity.</p>
    <p num="0008">The present invention corrects these problems by using
the similar products with ranges which are different to
those claimed and adds others which are vital to
considerably enhance its microbicidal effectiveness,
besides providing the product with a considerable dilution
capacity, cheapening it and even permitting its use as an
antiseptic, in specific formulations, designed for such a
purpose.</p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0009">This invention provides a disinfecting and antiseptic
composition, comprising oxidising agents, like hydrogen
peroxide, lactic acid and halogen salts (and/or heavy metal
salts), together with surfactants, that is, a biguanidine
like chlorhexidine with or without quaternary ammonium, or
anionic surfactants, like lauryl sulphate, alkyl succinic
or dodecyl sulphate salts. Additionally, the composition of 
the invention may contain water and some suitable
excipients, like alcohol.</p>
    <p num="0010">On the other hand, the composition is also antiseptic,
based on chlorhexidine and non-chlorinated quaternary
ammonium like didecyl methyl-polyoxy-ethyl-ammonium
propionate, with iodine (metallic or in salts) and suitable
excipients, like emollients and alcohol.</p>
    <p num="0011">Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidising disinfectant, of
medium activity against a plurality of micro-organisms. In
its undiluted formulation, the disinfectant composition of
the invention may contain 0.16-2.9% or 6.1-22.5% hydrogen
peroxide with respect to the total.</p>
    <p num="0012">Lactic acid, increasing the effectiveness of hydrogen
peroxide may be available in an amount comprised between
0.1% and 24%.</p>
    <p num="0013">Chlorhexidine is a biguanidine with a powerful
antimicrobial activity, but has little effectiveness
against virus and mycobacteria, such that in disinfecting
it should be combined with other products. In the present
invention, in the undiluted formula, it may be present at a
concentration comprised between 5.1% and 18%.</p>
    <p num="0014">Lauryl sulphate is an anionic surfactant with a wide
detergent effect, but with reduced microbicidal power,
frequently used in soaps for washing hands. This
disinfectant composition may contain it in a ratio
comprised between 3.1% and 20%.</p>
    <p num="0015">It may be substituted by another anionic agent, like
alkyl succinic or dodecyl sulphate, with proportions
similar to the anionic surfactants, with respect to the
total, although it is preferable to reduce them to 1-12%.</p>
    <p num="0016">The quaternary ammonium salts are cationic surfactants
frequently used in disinfecting and antisepsis, although
problems have been described related to their use due to
bacteria becoming resistant to them, but may be very useful 
when combined with other products, since they aid in the
destruction of bacteria walls. In its undiluted
formulation, these products will be in a wide ratio, from
0.2% to 50%.</p>
    <p num="0017">The halogens, like Br and I, are also frequently used
in antisepsis and disinfecting and usually act by
generating oxidising by-products of the microbial
components. In the composition of this invention, they are
incorporated at a ratio comprised between 0.001% and 5 of
the undiluted formula.</p>
    <p num="0018">The heavy metal salts, like silver, cerium, etc., are
widely used in disinfectants and antisepsis, acting by
accumulation of the latter in the bacterial cytoplasm. In
the composition of this invention, they were incorporated
in the range from 0.00002% to 2% in undiluted formulas.</p>
    <p num="0019">The disinfecting and antiseptic composition of the
invention may also contain a balance of water and
excipients, normally used in disinfectant composition
formulations, for example, food preserving agents, dyes,
enzymes and alcohol.</p>
    <p num="0020">In one of the preferred embodiments of the invention,
the ranges of the basic substances are as follows:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>hydrogen peroxide   0.16-2.9% or 6.1-22.5%</li><li>lactic acid:   0.2-20%</li><li>chlorhexidine   5.1-18%</li><li>excipients and water (balance)</li></ul>
where all the percentages are by weight with respect to the
total.</p>
    <p num="0021">In another of the preferred embodiments of the
invention, the disinfectant composition ranges are:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>hydrogen peroxide:   0.16-2.9% or 6.1-22.5%</li><li>lactic acid:   0.2-20%</li><li>alkaline metal lauryl sulphate:   3.1-20%</li><li>excipients and water (balance)</li></ul> 
where all the percentages are by weight with respect to the
total.</p>
    <p num="0022">Chlorhexidine or lauryl sulphate may also be replaced
by quaternary ammonium salts, or by mixing chlorhexidine
with the quaternary ammonium salts to give the surfactant
compound which binds to the hydrogen peroxide base, lactic
acid and heavy metal salts and/or halogen salts (Br, I).
Alcohol may also be added to improve evaporation and the
antimicrobial effectiveness. They may also bind to enzymes
like trypsin, amylase and lipase to give enzymatic
disinfectants.</p>
    <p num="0023">Another example to be used in antisepsis is the
following one in an undiluted formulation:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>chlorhexidine:   0.2-18%</li><li>didecyl-methyl-polyoxy-ethyl-ammonium propionate:
1-45%</li><li>iodine (metallic or its salts):   0.01-5%</li><li>excipients (one of them may be ethyl or isopropyl
alcohol)</li></ul></p>
    <p num="0024">The disinfecting and antiseptic composition of the
invention is very useful as a wide spectrum disinfectant
and especially destined to be used in any field,
veterinary, industrial or human medicine, since it is very
useful as a disinfecting agent for instruments (for
example, high level disinfecting in certain semi-critical
instruments, like flexible endoscopes) surfaces, conduits,
etc.</p>
    <p num="0025">For disinfecting, a suitable amount of the product of
the invention should be applied, diluted according to the
indication and quickness required over the material or
surface to be disinfected. This application may be
performed by any conventional method like immersion,
spraying, injection, impregnation with the aid of a
suitable applicator for the disinfecting composition over 
the conduits, surface or instruments to be disinfected,
both in the field of human medicine and that of veterinary
medicine or industry.</p>
    <p num="0026">Some of its components are originally separated and
combined at the time of use or dilution in water. At this
time, the mixture is considered as activated and has a
variable shelf-life, which in general exceeds two weeks
(which may be increased with suitable preserving agents),
although if contaminated objects are introduced, etc. it is
not convenient to let the solution to age, making it
recommendable to eliminate the dilutions at the end of the
day.</p>
    <p num="0027">On the other hand, the composition object of the
invention may also be used as an antiseptic, both in human
and veterinary medicine, it being possible to deposit it
over the skin like other antiseptics, by immersion,
application, spraying, etc. The antiseptic composition is
already reconstituted (it is not necessary to mix its
components "in situ") and has a minimum shelf-life of two
years.</p>
    <p num="0028">The disinfecting composition of the invention has a
much greater synergic effect than that expected from the
simple addition of the products present in it:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>In this sense, it was surprising to verify that the
combination of hydrogen peroxide with lactic acid and
surfactants (whether anionic or cationic), plus excipients,
has a synergic effect, as may be seen in figures 1 and 2
(said synergy being marked by the arrows descending from
the best of the basic components to the mixture) as well as
in examples 1-9 which show that said combinations increase
its microbicidal capacity and decreases the oxidising
effect of hydrogen peroxide, which does not alter the
instruments, hence being suitable for disinfecting any
material, including hospital material, preventing the 
problems described in disinfecting with hydrogen peroxide
in the equipment and persons using it for the disinfecting
of endoscopes, haemodialisers, etc.</li></ul></p>
    <p num="0029">On the other hand, the antiseptic variant of this
invention is also based on a synergic effect, as will be
shown afterwards, due to the combination of chlorhexidine,
certain quaternary ammonium salts and iodine.</p>
    <p num="0030">Besides, if this mixture of halogens with
chlorhexidine and quaternary ammonium salts, is added at a
ratio of 10-30% to 60° ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (this
alcohol completing the remaining solution by 90-70%), a
fast action antiseptic may be obtained which effectively
acts over healthy skin, eliminating the acquired flora and
reducing the autochthonous one, as will be shown later.</p>
    <p num="0031">The tests described below show that the disinfecting
composition of the invention is very useful for
disinfecting hospital or non-hospital material, even if
complex, with rough surfaces, etc. where other disinfecting
products may fail. The variants with antiseptic action are
harmless for the skin, such that they may constitute good
antiseptic products, improving the effectiveness and
persistence of reference antiseptic action, 10% povidone-iodine.</p>
    <p num="0032">The disinfecting and antiseptic composition of the
invention is obtained by mixing its basic compounds in
suitable amounts, stirring until total homogenisation,
although in certain formulas, some of the basic compounds
may only bind to the rest at the time of activation, which
is usually the same time as dilution in water.</p>
    <p num="0033">Structured in two parts, according to the main
indication as antiseptics or disinfectants, the following
examples are specific and illustrative embodiments of the
composition of this invention and must not be considered as
limiting its scope. </p>

      <u style="single">Preparation of a disinfecting composition</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0034">A disinfecting composition was prepared including:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>hydrogen peroxide:   16%</li><li>lactic acid.   24%</li><li>alkaline metal lauryl sulphate   20%</li><li>halogen salts (Br, I):   0.4%</li></ul></p>
    <p num="0035">The composition was obtained by mixing the appropriate
amounts of each component and stirring until complete
homogenisation.</p>
    <p num="0036">The efficacy was proved by carrying out the following
tests:</p>
    <p num="0037">Study of the bactericidal effect of the undiluted
composition as well as when diluted to ½ and ¼.</p>
    <p num="0038">Determination of the conservation of the concentrated
and diluted solution activity during 2 weeks.</p>
    <p num="0039">Instrument deterioration test.</p>
    <p num="0040">For the determination of these three effects, the
methods described by Herruzo et al in 1999 were used (Rev
Stomatol Chir maxillofac 1999; 100: 299-305), which may be
resumed as follows:
<sl><li>a) Bactericidal effect on instruments difficult to
disinfect: No. 25 endodontic files.
These files are contaminated in a micro-organism for
30 minutes and after drying for 15 minutes in an oblique
position, they are introduced in the disinfectant for 5,
10, 15, 20, etc. minutes. Afterwards, they are removed and
submerged in a tube with glass beads and a disinfectant
inhibitor (broth plus 6% Tween 80, plus 0.5% sodium
bisulphite and 0.5% sodium thiosulphate). The tubes are
then stirred for 1 minute to detach the surviving micro-organisms,
and samples are cultured over the entire surface 
of agar plates with the culture medium suitable for the
tested micro-organism (Müeller-Hinton or Saboureaud-dextrose
for yeasts or HIB for mycobacteria, etc.). The
control is similar in the whole test (disinfectant), except
that the contaminated endodontic file is introduced in
sterile distilled water and the culture is performed in
progressive dilutions to count the cfu (colony forming
units).</li><li>b) After preparation, the solution is left at room
temperature for 7-14 days and the trial is repeated, as
just described, but only with micro-organisms resistant to
disinfecting: P. Aeruginosa and Mycobacterium fortuitum.</li><li>c) The effect on the metallic material is obtained by
submerging a scalpel, after being removed from its sheath,
in the different dilutions of the disinfectant composition.
It is left at room temperature and the blackening or
deterioration is observed during one week (equivalent to
more than 2000 rinses of 10 minutes). It is recorded if
there was any deterioration or not and the time at which it
occurred. This test may be complicated if the first step
consists in submerging the scalpel in blood (coming from a
blood bank), since some of the disinfectants help to detach
this organic material while others, fix it and collaborate
in the deterioration of the scalpel.</li></sl></p>

obtained in all strains except in Mycobacterium, against
which, it did not completely destroyed the inoculum (not
even in the time of use, 20 minutes, that is, twice than
used for the disinfectant of the invention). Moreover,
when the scalpel model is studied with this alkylising 
agent, the influence of the need of a good rinse may be
observed, since if the scalpel did not have any organic
material, several days would be required for deterioration
of the model, but if it were impregnated with blood, it

survivors in all cases, besides remaining active for at
least 2 weeks and the scalpel not deteriorating, with or

    <p num="0055">In this case, another more demanding test was used,
since the sporicidal effect was assessed. It is similar to
the bactericidal effect, but instead of contaminated 
instruments, a commercial, cellulose germ holder was used,
impregnated in spores. In fact, this is the biological
control used in sterilisation by ethylene oxide: spores of
B subtilis, at a concentration guaranteed by the
manufacturer (3M) and which exceed a million spores per
germ holder. The rest was similar to that described in the
endodontic file method.</p>
    <p num="0056">The results were excellent, since 5 decimal logarithms
were destroyed in only 5 minutes in the 1/1 to 1/8
solutions. When lower dilutions (only with this germ) were
also used, namely 1/20 and 1/50, during 10 minutes, the
effect was lower, 2.6 log10 and 1.9 log10 of reduction,
respectively, but it was still sufficiently useful since if
we compare it with the reference disinfectant, 2%
glutaraldehyde, in this time (10 minutes) it only reduced
the inoculum by 1.5 log10.</p>
    <p num="0057">In the successive examples, the number of micro-organisms
used was reduced, since only 3 strains of the
following species (isolated from ICU patients) were used:
P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecalis, together

Basically, the tests are as follows:
<sl><li>a) <u style="single">In vitro:</u> 0.5 mm diameter lyophilised pig skin
(commercial) circles are cut and sterilised. Afterwards,
they are submerged in a micro-organism for 1 hour and
left to dry in an inclined position during 15 minutes.
Then, they are introduced in the antiseptic during 1 or
3 minutes and finally, the microbicidal is inactivated
with the inactivator used in the previous test (6% Tween
80, plus 0.5% sodium bisulphite, plus 0.5% sodium
thiosulphate). The rest is like that described in the
test with the endodontic files.</li><li>b) <u style="single">In vivo without artificial contamination of the hands:</u> 
The 4 index-little finger of the non-predominating hand
are submerged in 10 ml of the previously mentioned
disinfecting inhibitor and shaken inside the inhibitor
liquid for 1 minute. Then, cultured in 0.1 ml Mueller-Hinton
and extend over the plate. This is the initial
natural contamination control. Then, the hand is rinsed
with water to eliminate the inhibitor and then rinse
with the product to be tested for 3 minutes, rubbing it
between both hands (without a surgical brush).
Afterwards, the fingers of the predominating hand, etc.
are submerged to compare the number of cfu of each one.</li><li>c) <u style="single">In vivo with artificial contamination of the hands:</u> 2 ml
of a 24 hour culture of P. aeruginosa are applied over
them, letting them to dry for 5 minutes. Afterwards,
continue as in the previous experiment, but in the
control dilutions are also made before sowing the plate,
to be able to make an adequate count of the number of
cfu (generally 1000-10000).</li></sl></p>

    <p num="0101">As may be observed, it is more effective than the
reference antiseptic, although the difference is
appreciated even more if we study the persistence of the
antiseptic effect for two hours under a surgical glove 
(where there is sweating and recontamination of the hand
surfaces as from the micro-organisms housed in the bottom
of the sebaceous glands, pillose follicles, etc.). For this
purpose, a test is performed, similar to that described in
the "in vivo" methods with natural flora, but samples are
taken of the natural contamination of both hands, after
rinsing and taking samples from the predominating hand.
Then, the hands are dried (with the help of a collaborator)
with a sterile towel and surgical gloves worn. After two
hours, the volunteer removes the glove and a sample taken
from the non-predominating hand, in the same way as in the
previous trial. Therefore, we have three results: before,
immediately after and at 2 hours.</p>
    <p num="0102">The results at 2 hours were excellent (no micro-organisms
surviving: log 10&lt;0) in examples 11 and 13 (that
is, in those with alcoholic solution) and in 10 and 12, the
flora obtained increased log 10 with respect to that
obtained after rinsing, but still more than 3 log10 below
the initial result. However, PVPI, the reference
antiseptic, hardly has residual power, since the log10 cfu
obtained after removing the glove at 2 hours is 2-3 units
greater than that after rinsing and even, sometimes,
exceeds that obtained before rinsing, indicating the risk
of contamination of the surgical environment in the case of
puncturing the glove after this surgical intervention time.</p>
    <p num="0103">Not significantly different effects have been obtained
by replacing this quaternary ammonium by other non-chlorinated
quaternary ammonium salts (data not shown).</p>
