    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a CMOS
(complementary metal oxide semiconductor) image
sensor, and more particularly to a CMOS image sensor
adapted for an image pickup apparatus which can be
installed in a cellular phone, a personal computer,
or the like.</p>
    <heading>Description of Related Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">Recently, remarkable improvement of CPU
performance, progress of image processing technology
and the like have allowed to process digital image
data easily. In particular, in the field of
cellular phone or PDA (personal digital assistant),
some types with a display which can display images
appear on the market, and significant improvement of
data transfer rate in radio communication may be
expected in the near future. Accordingly, it is
anticipated that transfer of image data between such
types of cellular phones and PDAs are frequently
carried out.</p>
    <p num="0003">At present, after a subject image is converted
to image data by a digital still camera or the like,
transfer of such image data is carried out through 
internet by using a personal computer or the like.
However, in order to transfer the image data in such
a manner, both apparatuses, i.e., a digital still
camera and a personal computer, are required.
Lately, as an image input device of a mobile data
terminal, a miniature camera module in which both an
image pickup device and an optical lens system are
mounted on a substrate, is proposed. Such a
miniature camera module does not require to have a
digital still camera nor a personal computer and
enables picking up an image to send it to a person
simply, by a cellular phone which can be carried
around with ease.</p>
    <p num="0004">Further, as an image pickup device for such a
miniature camera module, CMOS image sensors are
given attention, in place of a conventional CCD
sensor, for the following reason.
<sl><li>(1) CMOS image sensors can be fabricated by
applying the present CMOS fabricating process
for semiconductor devices such as photodiodes
or the like, at low costs in comparison with
CCD sensors.</li><li>(2) CMOS image sensors can be operated by a single
power supply so that the power consumption for
that can be restrained lower than that of CCD
sensors.</li><li>(3) Signal processing circuits, e.g., a CMOS logic
circuit, can be integrated in the sensor chip
and therefore the CMOS image sensors can be 
miniaturized in comparison with CCD sensors.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0005">However, in the case that the image pickup
device and the optical lens system are mounted on a
single substrate, the light receiving plane of the
image pickup device has to be set at an in-focus
position of the optical lens system optimally.
Accordingly, adjustment for the purpose occurs a
large problem. For example, when mounting the image
pickup device and the optical lens system onto the
same substrate, it is difficult to set the light
receiving plane of the image pickup device at an in-focus
position of the optical lens system optimally
because of variation in thickness of the adhesive
which is used for mounting the optical lens system
onto the substrate and variation in size of the
components. In order to improve the dimensional
precision for setting the light receiving plane of
the image pickup device at an in-focus position of
the optical lens system, a high-precision setting
technique or a separate mechanism for adjusting to
obtain an in-focus state is required. Such a
requirement increases the production costs.</p>
    <p num="0006">Even when a CMOS image sensor is adopted
instead of a CCD image sensor, the above-described
problem arises similarly. Such a problem forms a
large obstruction to producing a compact miniature
camera module at a low cost. </p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0007">The present invention has been developed to
resolve the above-described problem. An object of
the invention is to provide a CMOS image sensor
which is adapted for obtaining an image pickup
device for a miniature camera module and which can
be produced at a low cost.</p>
    <p num="0008">In accordance with one aspect of the
invention, the CMOS image sensor comprising, a light
receiving unit as a photoelectric converting device,
and a signal processing circuit; further comprising:
a first layer comprising a color filter array and a
microlens array layered thereon, which are provided
on an upper surface of the light receiving unit; and
a second layer comprising at least one of a color
filter and a microlens array, provided in a region
of at least a portion of an upper surface of the
signal processing circuit.</p>
    <p num="0009">Herein, the term "photoelectric converting
device" means "a part comprising a plurality of
pixels which are disposed in two-dimensions, each of
the pixels having a photoelectric conversion
element". Each of the pixels generates a signal
charge corresponding to the intensity of light
received by each pixel. For example, each pixel of
a general CMOS image sensor comprises a photodiode
which performs photoelectric conversion and a CMOS
transistor which performs charge amplification and 
switching.</p>
    <p num="0010">The "signal processing circuit" means "a
circuit which comprises a driving circuit for
driving the pixels in order, to obtain signal
charges, an A/D converter for converting signal
charges to digital signals, and a digital signal
processing unit for forming image output signals by
using the digital signals".</p>
    <p num="0011">The "color filter" means "a filter which only
allows light of specific color components to pass
through. Typically, the color filter array provided
on the light receiving unit comprises red, green and
blue filters (primary color filters) or cyan,
magenta and yellow filters (complementary color
filters), which are arranged to correspond to pixels
of the light receiving unit, respectively, to obtain
color information. A color image can be obtained by
composing the whole output signals from the pixels.</p>
    <p num="0012">The "microlens array" means "a plurality of
microlenses, each having a hemisphere shape,
arranged on the photoelectric converting device in
two-dimensions, to increase the amount of light
entering photodiodes as the photoelectric conversion
elements of the pixels.</p>
    <p num="0013">Next, the function and effects in the case of
abutting a lens supporting member against the CMOS
image sensor will explained as follows.</p>
    <p num="0014">When a lens supporting member (including a
mirror frame) which supports an optical lens as a 
photographic optical system, is held by a substrate,
while abutting portions (legs) of the lens
supporting member are abutted against the upper
surface of the CMOS image sensor, not positioned to
a substrate, it is not required to consider
variations in thickness of the adhesive between the
substrate and the CMOS image sensor nor variations
in height from the substrate to the light receiving
plane of the CMOS image sensor, so that positioning
in the direction of the optical axis can be
performed precisely and assembly for an image pickup
apparatus can be performed with little effort. In
particular, 1-chip CMOS image sensor comprising a
light receiving unit and a signal processing circuit
which are integrated in the same semiconductor chip,
can have the signal processing circuit with a large
area enough to abut a lens supporting member against,
in the outside of the light receiving unit.
According to the CMOS image sensor, it is possible
to have a structure which enables abutting a lens
supporting member thereto easily in comparison with
a CCD image sensor. However, it is desirable to
consider a possibility of destruction of the CMOS
image sensor by abutting a lens supporting member
thereto carelessly.</p>
    <p num="0015">In the CMOS image sensor according to the
first aspect of the invention, because a first layer
comprising a color filter array and a microlens
array layered thereon, are provided on an upper 
surface of the light receiving unit; and a second
layer comprising at least one of a color filter and
a microlens array, is provided in a region of at
least a portion of an upper surface of the signal
processing circuit, the CMOS image sensor enables
abutting a lens supporting member thereto through
the second layer. As a result, it is not required
to consider the adverse effect of variations in
thickness of the adhesive between the substrate and
the CMOS image sensor and the like, and further it
is possible to reduce the possibility of destruction
or malfunction, of the CMOS image sensor by abutting.
Further, such a CMOS image sensor enables obtaining
a miniaturized image pickup device.</p>
    <p num="0016">Preferably, the signal processing circuit
includes a digital signal processing circuit and the
second layer is formed in a region of an upper
surface of digital signal processing circuit.</p>
    <p num="0017">In case that a color filter is disposed as the
second layer, the color filter preferably comprises
one of blue, red and green color filters.</p>
    <p num="0018">The second layer preferably comprises a
structure to enable placing a lens supporting member
for supporting an optical lens, thereon.</p>
    <p num="0019">The light receiving unit and the signal
processing circuit is preferably formed in the same
semiconductor chip, and the light receiving unit is
formed in an approximate central region of the
semiconductor chip and the signal processing circuit 
is formed in a peripheral region thereof.</p>
    <p num="0020">The region in which the second layer is
provided comprises at least separated three small
regions which surround the light receiving unit.</p>
    <p num="0021">Such a structure enables abutting a lens
supporting member onto the upper surface of the CMOS
image sensor, stably.</p>
    <p num="0022">The second layer may be provided to cover
almost whole upper surface of the digital signal
processing circuit.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
    <p num="0024">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present
invention will be explained with reference to the
drawings.</p>
    <p num="0025">In FIG. 1, CMOS image sensor 2 is provided
with a light receiving unit 2a which functions as a 
photoelectric converting device, in approximately
central region of the upper surface, and a signal
processing circuit 2c in a peripheral region thereof.
They are formed in the same semiconductor chip such
as a silicon single crystal chip. The light
receiving unit 2a has a large number of pixels (not
shown) which are disposed in two-dimensions. Each
pixel comprises a photodiode as a photoelectric
conversion element, and a CMOS transistor which
performs charge amplification and switching, to
generate a signal charge corresponding to received
light amount. The signal processing circuit 2c
comprises a driving circuit for driving the pixels
(photoelectric conversion elements) in order, to
obtain signal charges, an A/D converter for
converting signal charges to digital signals, and a
signal processing unit for forming image output
signals by using the digital signals, and the like.
On the periphery of the upper surface of CMOS image
sensor 2, in the vicinity of the outer ends of
signal processing circuit 2c, a large number of pads
2d are arranged, as shown in FIG. 1.</p>
    <p num="0026">CMOS image sensor 2 is adhered to fix at a
predetermined position on the substrate PC, as shown
in FIG. 2, and is electrically connected to a
predetermined circuit on the substrate PC through
pads 2d which are terminals for connecting and wires
W.</p>
    <p num="0027">On the upper surface of light receiving unit 
2a, a color filter array 2f for forming color
digital images is provided, and a microlens array 2g
is layered on color filter array 2f, as shown in FIG.
2. Color filter array 2f and microlens array 2g
constitute the first layer. Color filter array 2f
comprises, for example, red, green and blue filters
(three types of primary color filters), which are
arranged to correspond to pixels of the light
receiving unit 2a, respectively, by a
photolithography technique and the like. Color
images can be obtained by composing the whole output
signals from the pixels.</p>
    <p num="0028">Microlens array 2g comprises a plurality of
hemisphere-shaped microlenses arranged in two-dimensions
and is disposed on light receiving unit
2a through color filter array 2f to correspond to
the pixels, respectively, to increase the amount of
light entering the photodiodes as photoelectric
conversion elements of the pixels. Such a microlens
array can be fabricated by using a transparent
synthetic resin material, a photolithography
technique and a technique utilizing the heat
fluidity of synthetic resin.</p>
    <p num="0029">When color filter array 2f and microlens array
2g are formed on the upper surface of light
receiving unit 2a, they are also formed on signal
processing circuit 2c by the same process at the
same time. Generally, although color filter array
2f and microlens array 2g, formed on light receiving 
unit 2a are kept, the color filter array and the
microlens array, of the rest are removed in the
production process. On the contrary, in the present
embodiment of the invention, at least the color
filter array and the microlens array on necessary
regions (B), even of the rest, are left (the second
layer), as described later. Such color filter array
and microlens array constitute the second layer.</p>
    <p num="0030">Abutting portions 1b of a lens supporting
member 1 which supports an optical lens abuts onto
the upper surface of CMOS image sensor 2. The
reference numeral 3 denotes an optical lens. Next,
the abutting points of abutting portions 1b of lens
supporting member 1 will be studied, as follows.</p>
    <p num="0031">In order to depress the surface pressure
between abutting portions 1b of lens supporting
member 1 and CMOS image sensor 2, a certain large
abutting area for abutting portions 1 is required.
As a place for abutting lens supporting member 1,
the position of light receiving unit 2a of CMOS
image sensor 2 is not proper because pixels for
converting optical images to signal charges are
disposed at the place, and the position of pads 2d
in the region of signal processing circuit 2c
surrounding light receiving unit 2a is also not
proper because wire bonding is performed at the
place.</p>
    <p num="0032">On the contrary, there is a place with a broad
area enough to abut the abutting portions 1b in the 
region of signal processing circuit 2c between pads
2d and light receiving unit 2a. In particular,
digital signal processing circuit 2e in signal
processing circuit 2c has higher abutting force
resistance, i.e., higher pressure resistance.
Accordingly, CMOS image sensor 2 according to the
embodiment has a structure to enable abutting the
abutting portion 1 of lens supporting member 1, in
particular, on the upper surface of digital signal
processing circuit 2e.</p>
    <p num="0033">Proper place to be abutted, on the upper
surface of CMOS image sensor 2 will be explained
more concretely.</p>
    <p num="0034">In CMOS image sensor 2 according to the
embodiment, digital signal processing circuit 2e is
arranged in an approximate C-shape when viewing from
the top, i.e., region A shown by an alternate long
and short dash line in FIG. 1. Therefore, the
abutting portion 1b of lens supporting member 1 can
be abutted against any place in region A. It is
preferable that three, four or more abutting
portions 1b are provided, in consideration of
keeping a balance of lens supporting member 1 placed
on digital signal processing circuit 2e. In the
present embodiment shown in the drawings, four
abutting portions 1b, like four legs, are provided.</p>
    <p num="0035">Further, it is expected that provision of the
second layer, that is, the color filter array and
the microlens array, on the upper surface to be 
abutted, of digital signal processing circuit 2e
gives a stress relaxation to digital signal
processing circuit 2e. For this purpose, in CMOS
image sensor 2 according to the embodiment, four
rectangular shaped small regions B shown by an
alternate long and two short dashes line in FIG. 1,
in which the second layer comprising a color filter
array and a microlens array layered thereon, are
formed. The four abutting portions 1b which are
shown by a dash line in FIG. 1, of lens supporting
member 1 abut against the second layer in four
rectangular shaped small regions B.</p>
    <p num="0036">The color filter array and the microlens array
layered thereon (second layer), may be kept to cover
almost whole upper surface of the digital signal
processing circuit 2e.</p>
    <p num="0037">The second layer does not necessarily require
both a color filter array and a microlens array
layered thereon, on the signal processing circuit.
The second layer may be constituted with only one of
the color filter array and the microlens array.
When a color filter is disposed on the upper surface
of the signal processing circuit as the second layer,
the color filter may be constituted by at least one
of blue, red and green color filters.</p>
    <p num="0038">In the present invention, although the color
filter array and the microlens array on the upper
surface of light receiving unit 2a, i.e., as the
first layer, is required to have its inherent 
optical function, those on the upper surface of the
signal processing circuit 2c, i.e., as the second
layer, is not required to have its inherent optical
function.</p>
    <p num="0039">In the embodiment, because lens supporting
member 1 can be attached to directly abut to the
upper surface of the signal processing circuit 2c of
CMOS image sensor, not onto the substrate PC,
positioning of lens supporting member 1 with respect
to light receiving unit 2a, in the direction of the
optical axis can be performed accurately.</p>
    <p num="0040">In order to stably abut and fasten lens
supporting member 1 to signal processing circuit 2c
of CMOS image sensor 2, various types of structures
can be applied. For example, lens supporting member
1 abutting to signal processing circuit 2c of CMOS
image sensor 2 can be fastened by pressing lens
supporting member 1 down from the top by using an
elastic pressing attachment member or the like,
through an elastic member such as spring, which
gives an appropriate biasing force to lens
supporting member 1 in the direction of CMOS image
sensor 2, and by engaging to fasten the elastic
pressing attachment member to the substrate PC
elastically.</p>
    <p num="0041">Although the present invention has been
explained according to the embodiment, it should
also be understood that the present invention is not
limited to the embodiment and that various changes 
and modifications may be made to the invention
without departing from the gist thereof.</p>
    <p num="0042">For example, in the above-described embodiment,
electrical connection of CMOS image sensor 2 and the
substrate PC is performed by using wires W. However,
it can be performed also by wiring through the
inside of CMOS image sensor 2 to output signals out
of the rear surface or the side surface, of CMOS
image sensor 2. According to such a structure, it
is possible to conserve a broad region for signal
processing circuit 2c of CMOS image sensor 2 and to
carry out electrical connection easily. The image
pickup device according to the invention can be
incorporated into a digital camera, a cellular phone,
a personal computer, a PDA, an audio and visual
apparatus, a television, domestic appliances and the
like.</p>
