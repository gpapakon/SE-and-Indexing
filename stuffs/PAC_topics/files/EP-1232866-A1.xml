    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>1. <u style="single">Field of Invention</u></heading>
    <p num="0001">This invention relates to micromachined or microelectromechanical system
based fluid ejectors and fluid ejection methods.</p>
    <heading>2. <u style="single">Description of Related Art</u></heading>
    <p num="0002">Fluid ejectors have been developed for inkjet recording or printing. Ink jet
recording apparatus offer numerous benefits, including extremely quiet operation when
recording, high speed printing, a high degree of freedom in ink selection, and the ability
to use low-cost plain paper. The so-called "drop-on-demand" drive method, where ink
is output only when required for recording, is now the conventional approach. The
drop-on-demand drive method makes it unnecessary to recover ink not needed for
recording.</p>
    <p num="0003">Fluid ejectors for inkjet printing include one or more nozzles which allow the
formation and control of small ink droplets to permit high resolution, resulting in the
ability to print sharper characters with improved tonal resolution. In particular,
drop-on-demand inkjet print heads are generally used for high resolution printers.</p>
    <p num="0004">Drop-on-demand technology generally uses some type of pulse generator to
form and eject drops. For example, in one type of print head, a chamber having an ink
nozzle may be fitted with a piezoelectric wall that is deformed when a voltage is
applied. As a result of the deformation, the fluid is forced out of the nozzle orifice as a
drop. The drop then impinges directly on an associated printing surface. Use of such
a piezoelectric device as a driver is described in JP B-1990-51734.</p>
    <p num="0005">Another type of print head uses bubbles formed by heat pulses to force fluid
out of the nozzle. The drops are separated from the ink supply when the bubbles
collapse. Use of pressure generated by heating the ink to generate bubbles is described
in JP B-1986-59911.</p>
    <p num="0006">Yet another type of drop-on-demand print head incorporates an electrostatic
actuator. This type of print head utilizes electrostatic force to eject the ink. Examples 
of such electrostatic print heads are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,520,375 to Kroll and
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 289351/90. The ink jet head disclosed in
the 375 patent uses an electrostatic actuator comprising a diaphragm that constitutes a
part of an ink ejection chamber and a base plate disposed outside of the ink ejection
chamber opposite to the diaphragm. The ink jet head ejects ink droplets through a
nozzle communicating with the ink ejection chamber, by applying a time varying
voltage between the diaphragm and the base plate. The diaphragm and the base plate
thus act as a capacitor, which causes the diaphragm to be set into mechanical motion
and the fluid to exit responsive to the diaphragm's motion. On the other hand, the ink
jet head discussed in the Japan 351 distorts its diaphragm by applying a voltage to an
electrostatic actuator fixed on the diaphragm. This result in suction of ink into an ink
ejection chamber. Once the voltage is removed, the diaphragm is restored to its non-distorted
condition, ejecting ink from the ink ejection chamber.</p>
    <p num="0007">Fluid drop ejectors may be used not only for printing, but also for depositing
photoresist and other liquids in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries, for
delivering drug and biological samples, for delivering multiple chemicals for chemical
reactions, for handling DNA sequences, for delivering drugs and biological materials
for interaction studies and assaying, and for depositing thin and narrow layers of
plastics for usable as permanent and/or removable gaskets in micro-machines.</p>

      <u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0023">A fluid ejection system according to this invention operates on the principle of
electrostatic or magnetic attraction. In various exemplary embodiments, the fluid
ejection system includes a sealed diaphragm arrangement having at least one
diaphragm portion and a diaphragm chamber defined at least partially by the at least
one diaphragm portion, a nozzle hole located over the at least one diaphragm portion,
an ejection chamber defined between the nozzle hole and the least one diaphragm
portion and a secondary dielectric fluid reservoir containing a secondary dielectric
fluid. The ejection chamber receives a primary fluid to be ejected, which may or may
not be a dielectric fluid. The secondary dielectric fluid reservoir is in fluid
communication with the diaphragm chamber to supply the secondary dielectric fluid to
the diaphragm chamber. In various exemplary embodiments, the secondary dielectric
fluid is a liquid, a substantially incompressible fluid, and/or a high performance
dielectric fluid having a dielectric constant greater than 1. The use of a secondary
dielectric fluid reservoir containing a secondary dielectric fluid provides a fluid ejection
system with improved performance, particularly when the secondary dielectric fluid is a
high performance dielectric fluid having a dielectric constant greater than 1.</p>
    <p num="0024">In various exemplary embodiments, the fluid ejection system includes an
electrode arrangement that causes the diaphragm portion to deflect when a drive signal
is applied to at least one electrode of the electrode arrangement to generate an
electrostatic field between the at least one electrode and the diaphragm portion. The
diaphragm portion is attracted towards the at least one electrode by an electrostatic
force of the generated electrostatic field.</p>
    <p num="0025">As the diaphragm portion is deflected, the secondary dielectric fluid supplied to
the diaphragm chamber is allowed to flow into or out of the secondary dielectric fluid 
reservoir. Thus, the electrostatic force need not compress or expand the volume of the
secondary dielectric fluid in the diaphragm chamber to deflect the diaphragm portion.
Accordingly, substantially incompressible fluids and/or high performance dielectric
fluids having a dielectric constant greater than 1 may be advantageously used for the
secondary dielectric fluid.</p>
    <p num="0026">Since the electrostatic field is not across the ejection fluid, an increased variety
of ejection fluid designs mat be employed, such as polar, non-polar, conductive or nonconductive.</p>
    <p num="0027">If the electrode is situated so that the diaphragm portion deflects into the
ejection chamber defined between the nozzle hole and the diaphragm portion, a drop of
fluid is ejected through the nozzle hole when the diaphragm portion deflects. After a
drop is ejected, the movement of the diaphragm portion is reversed, either through
normal resilient restoration actions of the deformed diaphragm portion or through an
applied force. The reversed movement of the diaphragm portion may be used to refill
the ejection chamber with fluid to be ejected.</p>
    <p num="0028">If the electrode is situated so that the diaphragm portion deflects away from the
ejection chamber, fluid is overfilled in the ejection chamber when the diaphragm
portion deflects. When the drive signal applied to the electrode is removed, the
movement of the diaphragm portion is reversed, either through normal resilient
restoration actions of the deformed diaphragm portion or through an applied force, to
eject a drop of fluid.</p>
    <p num="0029">The fluid ejection systems of this invention may be easily produced via
monolithic batch fabrication based on the common production technique of silicon-based
surface micro-machining and would have the potential for very low cost of
production, high reliability and "on demand" drop size modulation. However, while
the following discussion of the systems and methods of this invention may refer to
aspects specific to silicon based surface micromachining, in fact other materials and
production techniques for the fluid ejection systems of this invention are possible.
Also, the systems and methods of the invention may be utilized in any mechanical
configuration of such an ejector (e.g., "roof shooter" or "edge shooter") and in any size
array of ejectors.</p>
    <p num="0030">Figs. 1-3 show a simplified illustration of a single ejector in a "roof shooter"
configuration is shown in Figs. 1-3. As shown in Fig. 1, the ejector 100 includes a 
base plate 110, an electrode 120, a diaphragm 130 and a faceplate 140 with a nozzle
hole 142. A diaphragm chamber 132 is sealed from the fluid to be ejected by the
diaphragm 130. In this example, air is contained in the diaphragm chamber 132.</p>
    <p num="0031">Fig. 3 shows an initial state of operation with the diaphragm 130 in an
undeflected state. As shown in Fig. 1, as an electrostatic field is generated across the
air gap between the electrode 120 and the diaphragm 130, the diaphragm 130 is
deflected into a deflected state. As the diaphragm 130 is deflected, fluid is drawn into
the space created by the deflected diaphragm 130 from a reservoir, which may be
located at any part of the periphery of the ejector 100.</p>
    <p num="0032">Assuming a uniform applied electrostatic force across the diaphragm 130, the
relationships may be approximated as follows:
<img id="img-00070001" orientation="unknown" wi="74" img-format="tif" img-content="mf" file="00070001.tif" inline="no" he="11"/>
where:
<sl><li>κ is the relative permitivity<img id="img-00070002" orientation="unknown" wi="9" img-format="tif" img-content="ff" file="00070002.tif" inline="no" he="4"/>, also called dielectric constant, of the fluid;</li><li><img id="img-00070003" orientation="unknown" wi="3" img-format="tif" img-content="ff" file="00070003.tif" inline="no" he="3"/> is the permitivity of free space (i.e., vacuum),;</li><li>A is the cross sectional area of the electrode; and</li><li>E is the electrostatic field strength.</li></sl>
This may be recast as an applied pressure as follows:
<img id="img-00070004" orientation="unknown" wi="73" img-format="tif" img-content="mf" file="00070004.tif" inline="no" he="8"/>
For a circular diaphragm of diameter "d" (radius "r"), the maximum deflection
occurring at the center of the diaphragm is approximately:
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center">δ = (Pr<st32:sup pos="post">4</st32:sup>)/(64D);</st32:df>
where:
<sl><li>D=(Et<sup>3</sup>)/(12(1-u<sup>2</sup>));</li><li>E is Young's Modulus;</li><li>t is the diaphragm thickness; and</li><li>u is Poisson's ratio.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0033">In actuality, as the diaphragm 130 deflects, the center of the diaphragm 130
will experience an electrostatic field, and hence a force, which is different than that
experienced by the periphery of the diaphragm 130. These relationships, however,
serve to illustrate the basic approach.</p>
    <p num="0034">When the fluid is to be ejected, the electrostatic field is removed so that the
resilient restoration force of the diaphragm 130 causes the diaphragm 130 to return to
its undeflected state shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 2 shows an intermediate non-static state
between the deflected and undeflected states shown in Figs. 1 and 3, respectively. The
resilient restoration force is transferred to the fluid, causing some fluid to be forced
back into the reservoir and some fluid to be ejected through the nozzle hole 142, as
shown in Fig. 3. This action is somewhat analogous to a "cocked" spring. The
percentage of the fluid which is expelled as a drop, relative to the amount of fluid being
moved by the diaphragm 130, may be controlled through specific design parameters of
the ejector 100. Such parameters include the size of the diaphragm 130, the applied
force, the distance between the diaphragm 130 and the faceplate 140 and other unique
features that may help govern flow, such as, for example, incorporating valves into the
ejector 100. This volumetric efficiency can be enhanced by optimizing the "cocked"
geometry of the diaphragm.</p>
    <p num="0035">As seen from the equations governing the deflection of the diaphragm 130, a
key parameter limiting the available force exerted on the fluid during ejection is the
dielectric constant of the compressible fluid in the diaphragm chamber 132. In this
case, air has a dielectric constant of approximately 1. While using air as the working
dielectric may offer simplified manufacturing, doing so may limit the overall
performance of the ejector 100. For example, a much higher voltage is required to
deflect the diaphragm, which may result in increased power dissipation in the ejector
100.</p>
    <p num="0036">Various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods of this invention
overcome such drawbacks. In a first exemplary embodiment of the fluid ejection
systems according to this invention, shown in Figs. 4-7, a fluid ejector 200 has a sealed
diaphragm arrangement comprising a diaphragm portion 230 and a diaphragm chamber
232. In this exemplary embodiment, the diaphragm chamber 232 contains an
incompressible secondary dielectric fluid 234. </p>
    <p num="0037">In the exemplary embodiment shown in Figs. 4-7, the sealed diaphragm
arrangement is formed on a substrate 210. An electrode 220 is situated on the
substrate 210 opposite the diaphragm portion 230. A faceplate 240 with a nozzle hole
242 is situated on a side of the diaphragm portion 230 opposite the substrate 210.</p>
    <p num="0038">An ejection chamber 250 is defined between the faceplate 240 and the
diaphragm portion 230. A fluid 252 to be ejected is supplied to the ejection chamber
250 of the fluid ejector 200 from a fluid reservoir, which may be located separate from
the fluid ejector 200. As shown in Figs. 4-6, a fluid reservoir 260 may be disposed on
a side of the substrate 210 opposite the diaphragm portion 230. As shown in Fig. 7, an
inlet hole 254 may be formed through the substrate 210 that leads to the fluid reservoir
260.</p>
    <p num="0039">The secondary dielectric fluid 234 may be supplied from a secondary dielectric
fluid reservoir 270, which may also be located separate from the fluid ejector 200. As
shown in Figs. 4-6, the secondary dielectric fluid reservoir 270 may be disposed on a
side of the substrate 210 opposite the diaphragm portion 230. As shown in Fig. 7, a
passageway 236 may be formed through the substrate 210 that leads to the secondary
dielectric fluid reservoir 270.</p>
    <p num="0040">The fluid ejector 200 operates on the principle of electrostatic attraction as
illustrated in Figs. 4-6. Fig. 4 shows an initial state and Figs. 5-6 show a fluid drop
being ejected. A drive signal is applied to the electrode 220 to generated an
electrostatic field between the electrode 220 and the diaphragm portion 230. As
shown in Fig. 5, an attractive electrostatic force causes the diaphragm portion 230 to
deflect towards the electrode 220 into a deformed state. Upon deforming, the fluid
252 is drawn into the ejection chamber 250 to overfill the ejection chamber 250. A
pressure is transmitted from the deflecting diaphragm portion 230 to the secondary
dielectric fluid 234 causing the secondary dielectric fluid 234 to flow through the
passageway 236 and into the secondary dielectric fluid reservoir 270. Thus, the
electrostatic force need not overcome the incompressibilty of the secondary dielectric
fluid 234 to deflect the diaphragm portion 230.</p>
    <p num="0041">The drive signal is then removed from the electrode 220 so that the movement
of the diaphragm portion 230 is reversed, either through resilient restoration actions of
the deformed diaphragm portion 230 and/or through an applied force, to expel a drop
of the fluid 252 through the nozzle hole 242. For example, although not shown, a 
second electrode may be associated with the faceplate 240 to apply a second
electrostatic force to attract the diaphragm portion 230 in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p num="0042">As previously described above with respect to the ejector 100 shown in Figs. 1-3,
the percentage of the fluid 252 that is expelled as a drop, relative to the amount of
fluid being moved by the diaphragm portion 230, may be controlled through specific
design parameters of the ejector 200. The parameters include the size of the
diaphragm portion 230, the applied force(s), the distances between the diaphragm
portion 230 and the faceplate 240 and other unique features that may help govern
flow, such as, for example, incorporating valves into the ejector 200.</p>
    <p num="0043">In various exemplary embodiments of the fluid ejection systems according to
this invention, a high-performance dielectric fluid is used for the secondary dielectric
fluid to enable significantly higher forces to be applied to the fluid. For example,
distilled water has a dielectric constant, κ, of about 78. This means that a diaphragm
structure may be designed to allow about 78 times the "spring" force to be applied to
the fluid to be ejected as compared to an approach using air. Distilled water also has a
very low conductivity, about 10<sup>-6</sup> S/m, which enables low energy usage. Other
dielectric fluids such as S-fluids, T-fluids, oils, organic solutions, etc. may be used. S-fluids
and T-fluids are test fluids having the same composition as various inks such as,
for example, dye-based aqueous inks, microemulsion inks, liquid crystalline inks, hotmelt
inks, liposomic inks, and pigmented inks, without any colorants. Possible organic
fluids include, for example, ethylene glycol, propanediol, diethylene glycol, glycerol,
trihydroxypropane, butanediol, pentanediol and dimethyl sulfoxide. The design
considerations for the secondary dielectric fluid include its dielectric constant, its
wetting characteristics and its stability for electric field strength and applied voltage.
Viscosity is also a consideration for the desired fluid flow with movement of the
diaphragm.</p>
    <p num="0044">Fig. 8 shows a second exemplary embodiment of a fluid ejector 300 according
to this invention. In the second exemplary embodiment, the fluid ejector 300 has a
sealed diaphragm arrangement comprising a diaphragm portion 330 and a diaphragm
chamber 332. The diaphragm chamber 332 contains a high-performance dielectric
fluid 334. </p>
    <p num="0045">In the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 8, the sealed diaphragm
arrangement is formed on a substrate 310. An electrode 320 is situated on the
substrate 310 opposite the diaphragm portion 330. A faceplate 340 with a nozzle hole
342 is situated on a side of the diaphragm portion 330 opposite the substrate 310.</p>
    <p num="0046">An ejection chamber 350 is defined between the faceplate 340 and the
diaphragm portion 330. A fluid 352 to be ejected is supplied to the ejection chamber
350 of the fluid ejector 300 from a fluid reservoir 360 formed on a side of the substrate
310 opposite the diaphragm portion 330. As shown in Fig. 8, an inlet hole 354 is
formed through the substrate 310 that leads to the fluid reservoir 360.</p>
    <p num="0047">The secondary dielectric fluid 334 is supplied from a secondary dielectric fluid
reservoir 370 that is also formed on a side of the substrate 310 opposite the diaphragm
portion 330. As shown in Fig. 8, a passageway 336 is formed through the substrate
310 that leads to the secondary dielectric fluid reservoir 370.</p>
    <p num="0048">The fluid reservoir 360 and the secondary dielectric fluid reservoir 370 may
include packing foam 380 that reduces "sloshing" and formation of bubbles in the
respective fluids. The fluid reservoir 360 and the secondary dielectric fluid reservoir
370 may be sealed tanks and may be permanently attached to the substrate 310.</p>
    <p num="0049">In the second exemplary embodiment, the fluid ejector 300 includes a "burping"
channel 390 that allows the diaphragm chamber 332 to be completely filled with the
secondary dielectric fluid 334. The channel 390 may be in fluid communication with
atmosphere or with an overflow basin 392. As shown in Fig. 9 illustrating a partial
plan view of the dashed circle in Fig. 8, the second exemplary embodiment has the
"burping" channel 390 offset from the inlet hole 354 so that the fluid 352 can reach the
ejection chamber 350 without interference.</p>
    <p num="0050">As the diaphragm chamber 332 is supplied with the secondary dielectric fluid
334, any air in the diaphragm chamber 332 is purged or "burped" from the diaphragm
chamber 332 through the channel 390. Some of the secondary dielectric fluid 334 may
also be forced out of the diaphragm chamber 332 through the channel 390 to ensure
that all of the air has been purged. The overflow basin 392 provides a convenient
receptacle for the excess secondary dielectric fluid 334.</p>
    <p num="0051">In an array of fluid ejectors, the fluid reservoir 360 and the secondary dielectric
fluid reservoir 370 may be common to each of the fluid ejectors 300. Similarly, the
"burping" channel 390 and the overflow basin 392 may be common to each of the fluid 
ejectors 300. Further, once the diaphragm chamber 332 is completely filled, the
channel 390 may remain open or may be sealed.</p>
    <p num="0052">The fluid ejector 300 operates as described above with respect to the first
embodiment.</p>
    <p num="0053">The inlet hole 354 and the passageway 336 may be formed through the
substrate 310 using a modified Bosch etch. Such a method is disclosed in copending
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/723,243, which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="0054">If needed, a modulated drive signal as disclosed in copending U.S. Patent
Application Serial No. 09/718,480, which is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety, may be used to increase dielectric fluid breakdown latitude. The essence of
this approach is using a substantially constant electrostatic field throughout the
"cocking" motion of the diaphragm. For fluids whose breakdown strength changes as
the critical breakdown dimension change, the input drive signal may be suitably
tailored to obtain substantially the maximum possible field strength. In more detail, to
minimize the chance of electrical breakdown or other electrochemical reactions
occurring within the dielectric fluid, the drive signal may be tailored to have certain
specified characteristics. For example, the system may be driven at a suitably high
frequency. Alternatively, or additionally, a bi-polar pulse train at the desired frequency
may be used.

Various changes may be made without departing from scope of the invention. For
example, the diaphragm may be configured as a bi-directional diaphragm as disclosed
in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/718, 476, filed November 24,
2000.</p>
