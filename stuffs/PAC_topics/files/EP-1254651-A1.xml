  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a fragrance and cosmetic
composition having a reinforced capacity for retaining the fragrances or
perfumes used in a variety of cosmetics and fragrance products. The
invention also concerns a fragrance and cosmetic product containing such a
composition.</p>
    <p num="0002">Fragrances and cosmetics are commonly used in: hair care products
such as shampoo, rinse, conditioners and the like; body cleaners such as
shower gel (or body shampoo) or liquid soap, cleansers for face washing
and the like; skin care products such as creams, milky lotions, beauty
washes and the like; fabric care products such as clothing detergents,
clothing softeners and the like. When fragrances are added to such
products, a proper measure is normally taken to retain these fragrances
after their use. Such a measure includes, for instance:
<sl><li>(a) using an enduring fragrance or a retaining agent (solvents such as
Hercolyn, alkylene glycol, alkyl citrate, benzyl benzoate, and
fragrances such as Peru balsam, vetiver benzoin, labdanum, oak
moss, patchouli), described in "Known and Conventional
Technologies (Toiletry and Similar Products), p.182, 1984;</li><li>(b) increasing the amount of fragrances and using a fragrance
preparation preferably containing a less volatile fragrance substance
having a higher molecular weight; and</li><li>(c) including fragrances in a clathrate compound such as cyclodextrin.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0003">However, in measure (a), even if the enduring fragrances or retaining
agents are used, the fragrances are dissolved into water by action of
surfactants and washed away. Desired fragrances can thus be hardly
retained in hairs, on washed articles or on human skin. In measure (b), the
fragrances contained in toilet articles or cosmetics become concentrated
and intensified during use. Accordingly, the fragrances may be felt far
different or removed from natural context. Moreover, such a measure is
very costly. In method (c), the fragrances lose their essence during use.</p>
    <p num="0004">Besides the above generally known technologies, there have been
reported other specific methods, such as:
<sl><li>(d) method described in JP-A-HEI-5-279 237: a fragrance composition
is supplemented with a humectant, oily substance and alcohol so as
to improve the scent endurance;</li><li>(e) method described in JP-A-HEI-10-45 553: a detergent composition
is supplemented with a specific amido-carboxylic acid as scent-retaining
agent;</li><li>(f) method described in JP-A-2000-95 658: a fragrance substance
having a specific chemical structure and vapour pressure is
combined with an aromatic sulfonic acid or its salts e.g. 2-naphthalene
sulfonic acid;</li><li>(g) method described in EP-A-679 715: a fragrance is supplemented
with lard or a surfactant so as to improve the scent retention; and</li><li>(h) method described in JP-A-2000-96 079: the endurance of a fragrance
or perfume adhered is improved by using tetra(2-hydroxypropyl)
ethylenediamine.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0005">However, in method (d), use is limited to alcohol products such as
eau de cologne. A product type such as used with washing water is not
suitable for this method, since the product cannot retain a sufficient amount
of scent. Further, as triglycerides are added in large amount to such a
product, it becomes sticky.</p>
    <p num="0006">In method (e), amido-carboxylic acid has to be added in an amount
equal to, or above, the amount of fragrance or perfume used. This creates
economical handicap.</p>
    <p num="0007">In method (f), the added sulfonic acid, when placed in acidic
condition, may generate a typical sulfide odour. Further, the amount of
sulfonic acid to be added is equal to, or above, that of fragrance or perfume
used. This renders the method more expensive.</p>
    <p num="0008">In method (g), the product tends to become viscous and to form a
lard odour. Further, the lard and surfactant have to be added in an amount
two or three times that of fragrance or perfume used. This renders the
method economically less attractive.</p>
    <p num="0009">In method (h), the endurance-imparting compound has also to be
added in an amount equal to or higher than that of fragrance or perfume
used. This renders the method more expensive.</p>
    <p num="0010">In all the above methods, a large amount of effective compounds,
relative to the quantity of fragrances, are required in order to retain
efficiently the fragrances in hairs or on washed articles and human skin.</p>
    <p num="0011">As can be observed from the foregoing, when fragrance products are
commercially prepared, a certain amount of adjuvant compounds are added
to the products. However, when the amount of adjuvant is small, no
measure or method disclosed up to now can efficiently improve the 
fragrance effects, to such a level that scents are retained even after water
washing or an unpleasant remnant odour is masked from washed material.</p>
    <p num="0012">The present invention intends to satisfy a long-dated desire to keep
scents for a long time, and provide a fragrance composition with scent-retaining
effect. The composition of the invention shows a marked effect
in a small quantity, relative to the amount of fragrances used, on retaining
the scents after washing, and on masking unpleasant odours of washed
material. The invention also provides a cosmetics or fragrance product
containing such a fragrance composition.</p>
    <p num="0013">To this end, according to the invention, lipid compositions were
searched which contain a ceramide and/or pseudo-ceramide, and it was
found that, when a slight quantity of ceramide and/or pseudo-ceramide
is/are added to a fragrance element, the fragrance endurance in cosmetics,
hair care products, body-washer, fabric care products or the like was
remarkably improved. It was further found that such a lipid composition
greatly improved the endurance of the fragrances used in hairs after
washing, on washed articles, or on human skin.</p>
    <p num="0014">The invention thus relates to a fragrance-retaining composition
comprising a sphingolipid-based composition A, and an ingredient B
comprising at least one compound chosen from the group consisting of
sterol-based compounds.</p>
    <p num="0015">Preferably, the sphingolipid-based composition A comprises:
<sl><li>a) at least a first ceramide ingredient A<sub>1</sub> selected from the group
consisting of 2-acylaminoalkan-1,3-diol and optically active forms
thereof represented by the formula (I): <img id="img-00050001" orientation="unknown" wi="61" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00050001.tif" inline="no" he="24"/>
in which R<sup>1</sup> signifies a straight-chain alkyl group having 9 to 17
carbon atoms, and R<sup>2</sup> signifies a straight-chain acyl group having 14
to 24 carbon atoms; and</li><li>b) at least a second ceramide ingredient A<sub>2</sub> selected from the group
consisting of 2-acylaminoalkan-1,3-diol and optically active forms
thereof represented by the formula (II):
<img id="img-00050002" orientation="unknown" wi="65" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00050002.tif" inline="no" he="25"/>
in which R<sup>1</sup> signifies a straight-chain alkyl group having 9 to 17
carbon atoms, and R<sup>3</sup> signifies an acetyl group or a straight-chain
acyl group having 2 to 24 carbon atoms with a hydroxy group at α-or
β-position; and</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0016">Preferably yet, the fragrance-retaining composition further comprises
at least one ingredient C selected from the group consisting of cholesterol
esters and higher fatty acids.</p>
    <p num="0017">Suitably, the first ceramide ingredient A<sub>1</sub> comprises a (2S,3R)-2-acylaminoalkan-1,3-diol
represented by the formula (IV): <img id="img-00060001" orientation="unknown" wi="67" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060001.tif" inline="no" he="26"/>
in which R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> are as defined for the formula (I).</p>
    <p num="0018">Suitably yet, the second ceramide ingredient A<sub>2</sub> comprises a (2S,3R)-2-acylaminoalkan-1,3-diol
represented by the formula (V):
<img id="img-00060002" orientation="unknown" wi="63" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060002.tif" inline="no" he="27"/>
in which R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>3</sup> are as defined for the formula (II).</p>

R<sup>3</sup> signifies acetyl group) according to a method disclosed in JP-A-HEI-11-12
118.</p>
    <p num="0068">Likewise, when the ceramide compounds A<sub>2</sub> are represented by the
formula(e) (II) and/or (V), a lipid composition having a lamellar liquid-crystal
structure may be prepared using 2-acylaminoalkan-1,3-diol (where
R<sup>3</sup> signifies a straight-chain acyl group having 2 to 24 carbon atoms with a
hydroxyl group in the α- or β-position) according to a method disclosed in
Japan Patent Application No.2000-169 104, published on 18 December
2001 under No.2001-348 320. In this disclosure, the lipid composition is 
composed of; at least one compound (A<sub>1</sub>) selected from the group
consisting of 2-acylaminoalkan-1;3-diol of the formula (I) and optically
active compounds thereof; at least one compound (A<sub>2</sub>) selected from the
group consisting of 2-acylaminoalkan-1;3-diol of the formula (II) and
optically active compounds thereof, the acyl group having a hydroxyl
group in the α- or β-position; and at least one compound (B) selected from
the group consisting of sterols. Further, the ingredients A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> and B are
blended in an appropriate ratio, such that they form a liquid-crystal
structure.</p>
    <p num="0069">When the sphingolipid-based composition A used in the invention is
a pseudo-ceramide ingredient A<sub>3</sub>, the lipid composition preferably has an α-gel
structure. Such a lipid composition has a lamellar liquid-crystal
structure when prepared, but its structure is unstable and subsequently
forms an α-gel structure.</p>
    <p num="0070">An appropriate ratio between pseudo-ceramide ingredient A<sub>3</sub>,
ingredient B and ingredient C may depend on the type and purity of the
ingredients used. However, this ratio can be easily determined by
performing the tests using a specific type and ratio.</p>
    <p num="0071">As to lipid compositions containing an amide derivative (pseudo-ceramide
compound A<sub>3</sub> of the formula (III)) and having an α-gel structure,
such lipid compositions may be prepared according to methods disclosed
e.g. in JP-A-SHO-62-228 048, JP-A-SHO-63-216 812, JP-A-SHO-64-4
236 and J. Chem. Soc. Jap., <u style="single">10</u>, 1107-17, 1993.</p>
    <p num="0072">In the endurance-reinforcing fragrance or cosmetic composition of
the present invention, fragrances are supplemented with a small quantity of
the above-mentioned lipid composition. As the result of this addition, the 
fragrance effect can be enhanced, and this effect remains even after water
washing. The addition of the lipid composition can also mask unpleasant
odour of washed articles. Besides, addition of such a lipid composition
does not impede the balance of fragrances during use.</p>
    <p num="0073">The amount of lipid composition to be supplemented in the
composition of the invention may vary as a function of the type or
combination of fragrances and lipid compositions used. However, in
general, the lipid composition is added in an amount of 0.01 to 5.0% by
weight, preferably 0.1 to 1.0 % by weight, relative to the amount of
fragrances. For a final fragrance or cosmetic composition, the effect of
lipid composition is not necessarily minimal when the quantity added is
very small, nor necessarily improves when the quantity is multiplied.
However, an excessive addition does not make sense economically. A
suitable quantity to be added can be determined easily by making
preparations with specific types and combinations of the lipid
compositions.</p>
    <p num="0074">As to fragrances for perfumed products, the lipid composition may
be added in a proportion of 0.01 to 2.0 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 1.0
% by weight, relative to the amount of fragrances.</p>
    <p num="0075">As regards fragrances for hair care products e.g. shampoo, for rinse,
and for conditioners, the lipid composition may be added, respectively, in a
proportion of 0.1 to 1.0 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 0.5 % by weight,
relative to the amount of fragrances.</p>
    <p num="0076">As to fragrances for body-washing e.g. shower gel or liquid soap, the
lipid composition may be added in a proportion of 0.1 to 1.0 % by weight,
preferably 0.1 to 0.2 % by weight, relative to the amount of fragrances. </p>
    <p num="0077">As regards fragrances for face-washing cleansers, the lipid
composition may be added in a proportion of 0.1 to 1.0 % by weight,
preferably 0.1 to 0.5 % by weight, relative to the amount of fragrances.</p>
    <p num="0078">As to fragrances for skin care products e.g. creams, for milky lotion,

relative to the amount of fragrances.</p>
    <p num="0079">As to fragrances for fabric care products e.g. clothing detergents and
