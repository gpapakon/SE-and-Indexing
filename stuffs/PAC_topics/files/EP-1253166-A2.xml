    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a method for creating a static resistant
or conductive product, typically a polymer film, by means of coating the product with a
polythiophene and surfactant-based antistatic coating. The antistatic or conductive
coating is also disclosed.</p>
    <heading>2. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="0002">Antistatic coatings are desirable for many applications, such as photographic
films, electronics packaging and other types of packaging. Polymeric films, for example,
have the tendency to develop built up static charge when subjected to frictional forces in
manufacture, processing, conversion, use and the like. An effective antistatic coating can
minimize or eliminate any detrimental buildup and discharge of static electricity on the
film or other surface. For other applications (including capacitors and the like), the
conductivity of the antistatic coating can be employed for other purposes. For many end
uses, it is important that an antistatic coating be substantially transparent. However, prior
art antistatic coatings have suffered from numerous limitations, including high cost,
inadequate transparency, incorporation of organic solvents, need for polymeric binders to
provide sufficient adhesion to the substrate and limited antistatic properties. There is a
need for antistatic coatings that address one or more of these problems. A need also
exists for antistatic coatings that are adapted for application to polymer film substrates.
Coatings adapted for in-line application are also desirable. </p>
    <p num="0003">Polythiophene-based conductive coatings are known in the art. These polymeric
conductors have been found to provide good antistatic properties. Their application to
polymer films has been explored, alone and in conjunction with certain surface active
agents. However, as is conventional in the use of surfactants, typically relatively low
levels of surfactants were contemplated or tested in combination with the polythiophene
polymers. Moreover, binders, organic solvents or both were used in conjunction with the
polythiophene-surfactant combination to create an acceptable coating. Compositions
substantially free of binders and organic solvents through the use of high levels of
surfactants were not found.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0004">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an antistatic
coating suitable for application to a base polymer film.</p>
    <p num="0005">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a base polymer film with
an antistatic coating on one or both sides.</p>
    <p num="0006">It is another object of the present invention to provide an antistatic coating that is
substantially free of streaks and smears, particularly when applied to a base polymer film.</p>
    <p num="0007">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an antistatic coating that
is substantially transparent.</p>
    <p num="0008">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a cost-effective
antistatic coating with positive performance and antistatic properties. </p>
    <p num="0009">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an antistatic coating that
is substantially free of organic solvents, and can be applied without the use of significant
amounts of organic solvents.</p>
    <p num="0010">It is a further object of the present invention to provide an antistatic coating
containing polythiophenes that does not require a separate polymeric binder to achieve
satisfactory adhesion to the film substrate.</p>
    <p num="0011">The present invention has accomplished these objectives by providing in a
preferred embodiment a coated polymer film having a coated surface that resists the
formation of static, the film including a polymer film layer, and an antistatic coating on
the film layer, where the antistatic coating includes a polythiophene and a surfactant,
where said surfactant is present in an amount by weight at least about equal to an amount
by weight in which said polythiophene is present.</p>
    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0012">The present inventors have surprisingly found that excellent antistatic properties
are provided by a coating that includes a polythiophene polymer and a high level of
surfactant. While smaller amounts of surfactant have been considered in the past for use
in conjunction with polythiophene polymers, the present inventors have unexpectedly
found that by increasing the surfactant content beyond conventional levels, not only is
adequate wet-out of the coating on film achieved, but in fact the conductivity and related
antistatic performance of the coated film are improved. Furthermore, binders and organic
solvents can be avoided or minimized by such use of high surfactant levels.</p>
    <p num="0013">The antistatic coating of the present invention includes a polythiophene polymer
to give antistatic and/or conductive properties to the coating and base polymer film. 
Polythiophenes are typically dark blue in color. However, due to the extreme thinness of
the preferred coating of the present invention, the blue color is not perceptible in a single
layer of film. Thus, as discussed later, coatings applied thinly by an in-line process are
preferred to thicker, off-line coated layers where the blue color is noticeable, and usually
undesirable. One preferred polythiophene is a 3,4-polyethylene dioxythiophene. Other
preferred polythiophenes are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,766,515 to Jonas et al., the
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This polythiophene is
commercially available in a dispersion with polystyrene sulfonate from Bayer under the
trade name Baytron PH, which contains no organic solvent or polymeric binder. Baytron
PH is disclosed to contain 0.8% polystyrene sulfonic acid and 0.5% polythiophene,
homogenized in a water base. Alternatively, a two component system of polythiophene
and polystyrene sulfonic acid (available from Bayer as Baytron C and Baytron M) can be
polymerized to achieve a similar product. Thus, in a preferred embodiment the
polythiophene is used in conjunction with a dispersing agent, preferably a polymeric
dispersing agent, more preferably a water-dispersible dispersing agent. Polystyrene
sulfonic acid is preferred for use as such a dispersing agent.</p>
    <p num="0014">The polythiophene is preferably present at about 0.08 to about 0.5 percent by
weight of the coating solution, and in an alternate preferred embodiment, it is present at
about 0.2 to about 0.4 percent by weight of the coating solution. About 0.2 to about 0.3
percent by weight is also preferred. Typically, the amount of polythiophene is minimized
to increase cost effectiveness.</p>
    <p num="0015">When a dispersing agent such as polystyrene sulfonic acid is used, it is preferably
present at about 0.1 to about 2 percent by weight of the coating solution, and in an
alternate preferred embodiment, it is present at about 0.15 to about 1 percent by weight of
the coating solution. As discussed above, the preferred ratio of polystyrene sulfonic acid
to polythiophene is 1.6 to 1. </p>
    <p num="0016">The antistatic coatings of the present invention also include a surfactant or
mixture of surfactants. In one preferred embodiment, the antistatic coating contains an
anionic surfactant. The anionic surfactant results in a high wetting tension on the surface
of the dried coating, and the high wetting tension enables an even application of the
polythiophene to the coated surface. The anionic surfactant further enhances the wet-out
of the water to maintain a clear, non-charged surface.</p>
    <p num="0017">Various surfactants have been evaluated for use in conjunction with the
polythiophene of the present invention and have been found to be effective. Anionic and
nonionic surfactants are preferred. In an alternate preferred embodiment, a
fluorosurfactant is included in the antistatic coating of the present invention. Preferably,
this fluorosurfactant contains fluoroaliphatic oxyethylenes of carbon chain lengths of
about 4 to about 8, and it can also include polyethylene glycol. Such a flurosurfactant is
commercially available from 3M as Fluorad FC-170C surfactant, which is nonionic. The
fluorosurfactant works beneficially because it minimizes or eliminates the coating streaks
that can be caused by certain surfactants. This effect is shown clearly when the coating is
applied to a polymer film surface. This is particularly important for antistatic coatings
that are applied to clear films for applications such as photographic films and certain
types of packaging, where clarity should not be limited by streaks or smears.</p>
    <p num="0018">Alternate surfactants that are preferred for use in the present invention include
sodium lauryl sulfate, an anionic surfactant commercially available from Rhone Poulenc
as Sipon UB, and a sulfosuccinate blend, an anionic surfactant commercially available
from Cytec Industries available as Aerosol OT/NV. While this blend is proprietary, it is
indicated to be covered by U.S. Patent No. 5,512,211, the disclosure of which is
incorporated herein by reference. A similar surfactant, Aerosol OT, is also commercially
available from Cytec Industries, and is a sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate. The nonionic
surfactant octoxynol-40 commercially available from Union Carbide as Triton X-405 is
also preferred for use herein. </p>
    <p num="0019">As discussed above, the amount of surfactant used has been found to be critical to
the antistatic and conductive performance of the coating. In accordance with the present
invention, the surfactant component is preferably present at about 0.1 to about 5 weight
percent of the antistatic coating composition. Even higher levels can be used, however
they typically result in an increase in haze, which is undesirable for many applications. In
an alternate preferred embodiment, the surfactant component makes up about 0.1 to about
3.2 weight percent of the coating. It has been surprisingly found that the fluorosurfactant
provides optimal results when present at about 1 to about 1.5 weight percent. With
regard to the relative levels of polythiophene and surfactant, it is preferable that the
surfactant be present at about one to about 10 times by weight of the polythiophene.
Alternatively, the surfactant is present at about four to about six times by weight the
weight percent of polythiophene. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed
that this synergistic effect is unrelated to any hygroscopic activity of the surfactant, as the
coating's performance has been found to be unrelated to ambient humidity.</p>
    <p num="0020">The preferred coatings of the present invention do not include significant amounts
of organic solvents. Most preferably, the coatings are substantially free of organic
solvents. Alternatively, the coatings of the present invention preferably include less than
about 10% organic solvents, or less than about 5%, or alternatively less than about 1% by
weight. Water-based coatings are preferred for health and safety reasons, due to the
elimination or reduction of potentially hazardous solvents. Water-based coatings are also
cost-effective. The ingredients of the antistatic coating are preferably formulated as a
dispersion in water or a water-containing solvent. However, alcohols or other suitable
organic solvents can be employed, alone or in combination with water. The solids level is
preferably up to about 6 weight percent, alternatively about 0.5 to about 4 weight percent,
or about 1.5 to about 2.5 weight percent.</p>
    <p num="0021">In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the coating is substantially free
of polymeric binders. These binders have been added in the past to thiophene-containing
coatings to promote adhesion of the coating to the underlying polymer film substrate. 
However, these binders can be costly, can affect the properties of the finished film, and
can have other drawbacks, such as interrupting the continuous coating film of conductive
polythiophene on the surface of the polyester film. Alternatively, coatings of the present
invention can contain less than about 10 percent polymeric binder; or less than about 5%,
or less than about 1% by weight. The high surfactant compositions of the present
invention do not rely on the use of substantial amounts of polymeric binder to permit
adhesion of the coating to the substrate.</p>
    <p num="0022">In addition, a slip agent is preferably incorporated into the antistatic coating of the
present invention. The slip agent is believed to enhance the ability of the coated film to
wind smoothly during the manufacturing process. The slip agent is preferably inorganic.
More preferably, the slip agent includes colloidal SiO<sub>2</sub>, most preferably the product
commercially available as Nalco 1034A® colloidal SiO<sub>2</sub> from the Nalco Chemical
Company. Other slip agents that are preferred for use in the present invention include
silica in one or more of its various morphological forms, including those commercially
available as Syloid ® silica or Rapidup ® silica, although due to their larger particle size,
they are less preferred for uses in which clarity and low haze are needed. Moreover, a
combination of two or more of the foregoing slip agents is also preferred for use. The
slip agent is preferably present at about 0.05 to about 2 weight percent of the antistatic
coating. In an alternate preferred embodiment, the slip agent is present at about 0.05 to
about .5 weight percent, or in a third preferred embodiment at about 0.1 weight percent.</p>
    <p num="0023">Conventional additives that are known in the art can be included in the antistatic
coatings of the present invention. For example, pigments, other colorants, stabilizers,
other antistatic agents, adhesion promoters, antioxidants, delusterants, fillers, plasticizers
and the like can be included in the antistatic coatings of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="0024">The preferred solids level of the antistatic coating, as it is applied to the base
polymer film, is a level sufficient to yield a final dry coating thickness within the range of 
about 0.001 microns to about 0.1 microns, alternatively about 0.005 microns to about
0.05 microns.</p>
    <p num="0025">Antistatic properties are typically determined on the basis of surface resistance or
resistivity of the coated film. This is conventionally measured in ohms per square. Films
having a surface resistivity of approximately 10<sup>11</sup> ohms per square are generally
considered to have preferred antistatic performance. A surface resistivity of
approximately 10<sup>9</sup> ohms per square is also considered preferred, with surface resistivity
figures of about 10<sup>8</sup> ohms per square alternately being considered preferred. Thus, films
of the present invention preferably have a surface resistivity of about 10<sup>11</sup> ohms per
square or less, with measurements of about 10<sup>9</sup> or less and about 10<sup>8</sup> or less being
alternately preferred.</p>
    <p num="0026">The coating compositions of the present invention can be formulated by simply
combining the desired coating components. Agitation may be used to insure an even
dispersion or solution. Although the order of mixing is not critical, a preferred method
follows: 1. Dilute Baytron PH in deionized water, 2. While mixing, add surfactant, 3.
While mixing, add colloidal silica. The most significant feature of mixing is ideally to
maintain the acid pH of the mixture for overall stability of the coating, as the polystyrene
sulfonic acid component is acidic. Surfactants are generally stable in acid or alkaline
media, but colloidal silica is generally alkaline stable. Nalco 1034A is preferred for its
unusual acid stability.</p>

    <p num="0027">For many preferred uses of the coating and method of the present invention, a
polymer film substrate is most useful. It provides a lightweight, substantially transparent,
inexpensive, disposable or recyclable substrate that accommodates many of the end uses
of static resistant materials. In addition, the coated polymer film can also easily be
laminated by heat bonding or by adhesives to various other substrates. </p>
    <p num="0028">The antistatic coatings and coating methods of the present invention are
applicable to any polymeric film capable of acting as a substrate for an antistatic coating.
For example, the present invention is applicable to polymeric films such as those made
from polyamides exemplified by nylon; polyolefins such as polypropylene and
polyethylene; polyester such as polyethylene terephthalate; polyacetal; polycarbonate; and
the like. The invention is particularly applicable to polyester, most preferably
polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate or polybutylene terephthalate. The
present invention is also applicable to polymeric films including copolyesters such as
polyethylene terephthalate isophthalate. A preferred process for forming a base film is set
forth in U.S. Patent Number 5,350,601 to Culbertson et al., incorporated herein by
reference. Generally, any polyester film based on a polymer resulting from
polycondensation of a glycol or diol with a dicarboxylic acid (or its ester equivalents)
such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, sebacic acid, malonic, adipic, azelaic, glutaric,
suberic, succinic acids and the like, of mixtures of two or more of the foregoing, are
preferred for use in the present invention. Suitable glycols include ethylene glycol,
diethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and polyols such as butanediol and the like.
Mixtures of two or more of the foregoing are also suitable.</p>
    <p num="0029">Any of the above base polymer films can contain conventional additives such as
antioxidants, delusterants, pigments, fillers such as silica, calcium carbonate, kaolin,
titanium dioxide, antistatic agents and the like, or mixtures thereof, all of which are well
known in the art.</p>
    <p num="0030">In addition, the base polymer film may be a polymer laminate. Such laminates
include polymer-polymer laminates like polyester-polyolefin or polyester-adhesive-polyolefin,
polymer-metallic laminates such as polyester-aluminum, or polymer-paper or
polymer-adhesive-paper laminates. Coated polymer films or film laminates can also be
used. Primer coatings used to enhance wet-out or coating adhesion are preferred
examples of such coatings. </p>
    <p num="0031">The films may be produced by any well known technique in the art. For example,
polyester is typically melted and extruded as an amorphous sheet onto a polished
revolving casting drum to form a cast sheet of the polymer. The sheet is quickly cooled
and then stretch oriented in one or more directions to impart strength and toughness to the
film. The sheet is typically stretched from about two to about four times the original cast
sheet dimension, in one or both directions. Biaxial orientation is most preferred, with
monoaxial orientation being less preferred. Generally, stretching occurs in a temperature
range from about the second order transition temperature of the polymer to below the
temperature at which the polymer softens and melts. Where necessary, the film is heat
treated after stretching to "lock-in" the properties by further crystallizing the film. The
crystallization imparts stability and good tensile properties to the film. Such heat
treatment for polyester film is generally conducted at about 190°C to about 240°C.</p>

      <u style="single">Alternate Substrates</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0032">As discussed above, the coatings and methods of reducing static of the present
invention are not limited to use on polymer film bases. Alternate substrates such as
metals, glass, polymeric articles and the like can be coated according to the teachings of
the present invention. Furthermore, it is envisioned that polymer films coated with the
coatings of the present invention can also be applied to other surfaces, including irregular
surfaces, to provide antistatic properties to those surfaces. The film may be heat bonded
or adhered to the surface, or can be mechanically attached via fasteners, clips and the like.</p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">Coating Methods</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0033">In-line coating of the base polymer layer, in which the coatings are applied during
the film manufacturing process and before it is heat-set, is the preferred method for use of
the coatings disclosed herein. Typically, the base polymer film is coated after corona
treatment and prior to the stretch orientation of the film as described in British Patent No. 
1,411,564, or coated between drawing steps (when biaxially oriented film is produced) as
taught by U.S. Patent Number 4,571,363, or coated post-draw as taught by U.S. Patent
Number 3,322,553.</p>
    <p num="0034">In addition to in-line coating, one or more of the coatings of the present invention
may be off-line coated (after manufacturing and heat setting the film), preferably after
conventional surface modification of the polymeric substrate has occurred. Thus, the
coating and method of the present invention are also intended for use where, for example,
the base polymer film is produced and later coated off-line with one or more coatings of
the present invention. Alternatively, one or more coatings can be applied in-line, with the
remainder being applied off-line. Conventional off-line coating processes include roll
coating, reverse roll coating, gravure roll coating, reverse gravure roll coating, brush
coating, wire-wound rod (Meyer rod) coating, spray coating, air knife coating, meniscus
coating or dipping.</p>
    <p num="0035">While surface modification of the base polymer film prior to coating is not
required, it has been found that better results are obtained if the surface or surfaces of the
base polymer film are modified before application of the coatings of the present
invention. Conventional surface modification techniques include corona treatment,
which is the most common and most preferred procedure for modifying the surface of the
polymer base film to enhance coating adhesion. The corona treatment or other surface
modification should be sufficient to permit wetting out of the coating. Corona treatment
of about 3.0 to 9.0 watts per square foot per minute is typically sufficient to achieve the
desired results. In addition, primer or other intermediate layers can optionally be used
between the polymer film and the antistatic coating.</p>
    <p num="0036">In light of the foregoing, a preferred method of controlling static formation on
polymer film is provided herein. Preferably, one or both faces of a base polymer film are
coated with an antistatic coating of the present invention. Optionally, if only one face is
coated with the antistatic coating of the present invention, this coating can occur before, 
after or at the same time the opposite face of the base polymer film is coated with an
alternate coating. The antistatic coating is preferably not overcoated with another
coating. Such a top coating could limit the ability of the antistatic coating to prevent
static.</p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">Examples</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0037">The following Examples demonstrate various aspects of certain preferred
embodiments of the present invention, and are not to be construed as limitations thereof.
The formulations of the individual samples are shown in the charts below. In each
example, the listed coating samples were formulated and coated in-line on biaxially
oriented polyester film. Specifically, biaxially oriented and heat set PET film was coated
in-line between draw steps film with the following sample coatings. In all of the
following examples, antistatic performance was tested by conditioning the samples to
about 50% relative humidity at about 73 degrees Fahrenheit. The samples were then
tested for surface resistivity using approximately 10 (or 5, where noted) volts of
electricity (vs. the standard 500 volts) using ASTM D257. Where tape peel tests were
performed (a criterion important for, e.g., films used as layout base for printing plate
masters in the graphic arts), the following method was used: A one inch wide strip of the
3M Scotch® 616 brand adhesive tape is applied to the coated surface of the polyester film
and the tape is separated at a speed of 12 inches/minute with an angle of separation
between the tape and film of approximately 90°. A tape peel force of 454 g/inch or higher
is acceptable adhesion for layout base, with measurements of about 800 to about 1100
g/inch being preferred. Total haze and transmission were determined using ASTM D
1003. Coefficient of friction was determined using ASTM D 1894. </p>

    <p num="0039">This series demonstrates that at higher surfactant concentrations (for example, at about
0.1 weight percent and higher), viable antistatic films are created, even without the use of
organic solvents or polymeric binders. As the relative proportion of surfactant versus
thiophene is increased, the surface resistivity decreases. Desirable friction, adherence to 
3M Scotch® brand 616 adhesive tape and optical properties are achieved. The slip
additive does not negatively impact surface resistivity, and in fact appears to provide a
slight improvement. Baytron CPUD, which is a blend of a polyurethane polymer with
Baytron PH, has less preferred antistatic performance relative to Baytron PH alone.
However, even with Baytron CPUD, the surface resistivity is reduced with an increase in
the level of FC-170C fluorosurfactant.</p>

This Example Series demonstrates that the further addition of polystyrene sulfonic acid
above the levels present in the Baytron PH does not provide enhanced surface resistivity.
Furthermore, as shown in Examples D-11 and D-12, beyond a certain surfactant level no
appreciable improvement in surface resistivity is detected.</p>
