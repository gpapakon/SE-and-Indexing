        <u style="single">Background Art</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0001">A stent is commonly used as a tubular structure left inside the lumen of
a duct to relieve an obstruction. Commonly, stents are inserted into the lumen
in a non-expanded form and are then expanded autonomously (or with the aid
of a second device) <i>in situ.</i> A typical method of expansion occurs through the
use of a catheter mounted angioplasty balloon, which is inflated within the
stenosed vessel or body passageway, in order to shear and disrupt the
obstructions associated with the wall components of the vessel and to obtain
an enlarged lumen.</p>
    <p num="0002">In the absence of a stent, restenosis may occur as a result of elastic
recoil of the stenotic lesion. Although a number of stent designs have been
reported, these designs have suffered from a number of limitations. These
include restrictions on the dimension of the stent.</p>
    <p num="0003">Other stents are described as longitudinally flexible but consist of a
plurality of cylindrical elements connected together. This design has at least
one important disadvantage, for example, according to this design, protruding
edges occur when the stent is flexed around a curve raising the possibility of
inadvertent retention of the stent on plaque deposited on arterial walls. This
may cause the stent to form emboli or move out of position and further cause
damage to the interior lining of healthy vessels. </p>
    <p num="0004">Thus, stents are known in the art. Such stents may be expanded during
or just after balloon angioplasty. As a general rule, the manufacture of a stent
will need to compromise axial flexibility in order to permit expansion and
provide overall structural integrity.</p>
    <p num="0005">Prior stents have had a first end and a second end with an intermediate
section between the two ends. The stent further has a longitudinal axis and
comprises a plurality of longitudinally disposed bands, wherein each band
defines a generally continuous wave along a line segment parallel to the
longitudinal axis. A plurality of links maintains the bands in a tubular structure.
In a further embodiment of the invention, each longitudinally disposed band of
the stent is connected, at a plurality of periodic locations, by a short
circumferential link to an adjacent band. The wave associated with each of the
bands has approximately the same fundamental spatial frequency in the
intermediate section, and the bands are so disposed that the waves associated
with them are spatially aligned so as to be generally in phase with one another.
The spatial aligned bands are connected, at a plurality of periodic locations, by
a short circumferential link to an adjacent band.</p>
    <p num="0006">In particular, at each one of a first group of common axial positions,
there is a circumferential link between each of a first set of adjacent pairs of
bands.</p>
    <p num="0007">At each one of a second group of common axial positions, there is a
circumferential link between each of a second set of adjacent rows of bands,
wherein, along the longitudinal axis, a common axial position occurs alternately
in the first group and in the second group, and the first and second sets are 
selected so that a given band is linked to a neighboring band at only one of the
first and second groups of common axial positions.</p>
    <p num="0008">Furthermore, this stent can be modified to provide for bifurcated access,
whereas the stent itself is uniform throughout. If the manufacturer designs
such a stent to have an large enough opening, then it is possible to place the
stent such that a pair of stents can be placed one through the other. In this
fashion, the stents are capable of being placed at a bifurcation, without any
welding or any special attachments. An interlocking mechanism can be
incorporated into the stent design to cause the stent to interlock at the desired
position during assembly of the device.</p>
    <p num="0009">Further, a metallic stent has been designed which contains a repeating
closed loop feature. The stent is designed such that the closed loop does not
change dimensions during expansion. The composite stent is created by filling
the area enclosed by the loops with a material that enhances clinical
performance of the stent. The material may be a ceramic or a polymer, and
may be permanent or absorbable, porous or nonporous and may contain one
or more of the following: a therapeutic agent, a radio-opaque dye, a
radioactive material, or a material capable of releasing a therapeutic agent,
such as rapamycin, cladribine, heparin, nitrous oxide or any other know drugs,
either alone or in combination.</p>
    <p num="0010">It has been seen, however, that it may be desirable to provide for
stents that have both flexibility to navigate a tortuous lesion as well as
increased column strength to maintain the rigidity necessary after
emplacement into the lumen of the body. The preferred designs tend to 
provide the flexibility via undulating longitudinal connectors. The rigidity is
generally provided via the mechanism of slotted tubular stents. It is
perceived that there may be mechanisms capable of enhancing the
characteristics of these types of stents. Such a stent would be both flexible
in delivery and rigid upon emplacement.</p>
    <p num="0011">Furthermore, it is desirable to be able to produce stents in which the
cross-sectional profile of either the struts or the connecting members is
tapered (or variable) in size. In addition, it may be desirable to modify stents
to have non-rectangular cross-sections. In both these cases, different
manufacturing methods may aid in the creation of such stents.</p>

        <u style="single">Summary of the Invention</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0012">It is an object of the invention to provide a stent having has relatively
little foreshortening.</p>
    <p num="0013">It is an object of the invention to provide a stent having an enhanced
degree of flexibility.</p>
    <p num="0014">It is an object of the invention to provide such a stent while
diminishing any compromise in the stent's structural rigidity upon expansion.</p>
    <p num="0015">It is a further object of the invention to provide a novel method for
manufacturing stents. </p>
    <p num="0016">These and other objects of the invention are described in the
following specification. As described herein, a preferred embodiment of a
stent provides for a device that contains a flexible section and a folded strut
section. The folded strut section opens (like a flower) upon expansion. This
folded strut section provides both structural rigidity and reduction in
foreshortening of the stent mechanism. The flexible section provides
flexibility for delivery of the stent mechanism.</p>
    <p num="0017">In a second embodiment of the device, there is a columnar section
and a flexible section. The columnar section provides for a device that
lengthens in the longitudinal direction upon expansion. The flexible section
provides for a section that shortens somewhat in the longitudinal direction
upon expansion. As a result, there is no shortening or lengthening of the
stent during expansion. The flexible section columns are angled, one with
respect to the other, and also with respect to the longitudinal axis of the
stent, in order to provide flexibility during delivery. This arrangement also to
also provide additional resistance to the balloon to prevent "dogboning" of
the stent on the balloon during delivery and slippage of the balloon along the
stent. These relatively flexible sections are oppositely phased with respect
to one another in order to negate any torsion along their length. These
flexible sections can further be crimped onto the balloon catheter with a
generally smaller profile than prior stent, so that the retention of the stent on
the balloon is increased.</p>
    <p num="0018">In yet another embodiment of the stent of the present invention, the
flexible connector can take on an undulating shape (like an "N"), but such
that the longitudinal axis of the connector is not parallel with the longitudinal 
axis of the stent. In this fashion, the flexibility is controlled in a pre-selected
axis, which is not the longitudinal axis of the stent. Such an arrangement
may be desired, for instance, when one chooses to place a stent in a
particularly configured vasculature that has been predetermined by known
means, such as intravascular ultrasound ("IVUS.")</p>
    <p num="0019">In still a further embodiment of the present invention, there are
provided "living hinge" connectors, which connect the generally flexible
connectors to the stronger radial strut members. These living hinges
accomplish a number of the same characteristics found in the prior
embodiments disclosed herein. First, because the living hinges tend to
expand upon inflation, foreshortening of the length of the stent is further
reduced. Second, there is a combined radial strength provided at the
intersection between the living hinges and the radial strut members. This
creates a small "hoop," which is further resistant to kinking or collapse <i>in
situ.</i> Third, as a corollary to the second attribute described above, the living
hinge connectors provide for reduced strain along an equivalent length of
stent.</p>
    <p num="0020">In yet another preferred embodiment of the stent of the present
invention, the connection point between the radial members and the
connector members is moved to a position along the length of a radial strut.
Typically, the connection may be placed at a position somewhere midway
along the length of the strut. By moving the connection point of the flex
connectors closer to the midpoint of the radial ring one can address
foreshortening in an controlled fashion. In fact, balloon interaction aside, the
connector does not have to stretch to compensate for foreshortening. When 
the flex connectors are connected at the midpoint of the radial ring, the
distance/length through the middle portion of the stent between radial rings
will remain unchanged. This is because the midpoint stays relativiely in the
same position while the radial arcs of each strut move closer to the midpoint
from both sides. By moving the location of the flex connector attachment
beyond the mid-point of a strut, to the opposing side, one can actually
capitilize on the strut moving closer to the midpoint and thus lengthen the
stent upon expansion.</p>
    <p num="0021">In addition, in the present embodiment described, adjacent radially
rings start out of phase in the unexpanded state. Due to the diagonal
oreintation of the connection points of the flexible connectors, upon
expansion the radial rings tend to align themselves ("in" phase.) This results
in more uniform cell space and thus improved scaffolding of the vessel.
Further, there is described a "wavy" strut configuration, thereby facilitating
both a reduced crimp profile for attaching the flexible connectors at or near a
strut mid-point and reduced strain upon expansion, due to the strut itself
contributing to a portion of the expansion.</p>
    <p num="0022">Finally, a new method is disclosed for making stents. In this method
there is novel photochemical machining of a cylindrical tube. The method
consists of performing a standard photochemical machining process of
cutting, cleaning and coating the tube with a photoresist. However, unlike
former methods, the photoresist image is developed on the surface of the
cylindrical metallic tube, which results in a controlled variable etching rate at
selected sites on the cylindrical metallic tube during the etching process.
The photoresist image consists of a series of circular regions of photoresist 
of varying diameters configured at varying distances along the stent. As the
diameter of the circular photoresist pattern decreases and the distance
between the circular photoresist patterns along the stent increases, the etch
rate of the device increases. The photoresist pattern variation results in a
variation in the metal removed during the etching process.</p>
    <p num="0023">This process can be used to locally change the geometry of the
cylindrical metallic tube. An advantage seen by this process is the ability to
manufacture a tapered strut along the stent. Further, struts of cylindrical or
other non-rectangular cross-section can be manufactured. In addition,
surface contours can be placed on the stent, for instance, to allow for a
reservoir to be placed in the stent to deliver drugs.</p>

    <p num="0026">As can be seen in Figure 1, there is described a cylindrical stent 10
which has a series of folded strut sections 20 connected by a series of
flexible sections 30. The folded strut sections 20 comprise a generally
folded strut member 25 having a pair of ends 24, 26. Each of the pair of
ends 24, 26 is connected to another folded strut member 25 and also to the
end of a flexible member 35. Thus, each end 34, 36 of a flexible member 35
is connected to two ends 24, 26 of a folded strut 25 section member. </p>
    <p num="0027">Each of the folded struts 25 takes on a generally irregular pattern.
On the other hand, each of the flexible sections 35 takes on a generally
undulating pattern. The folded strut sections 20 wrap circumferentially
around the cylindrical shape of the stent 10. Each flexible section 30 also
connects to a folded strut section 20 around the circumference of the stent.
It will be noticed that each adjacent flexible section 30 is positioned 180° out
of phase with each other.</p>
    <p num="0028">The longitudinal lengths of the folded struts 20 are short enough to
give a smooth profile when the stent is bent. The folded strut 20 allows for a
large diametrical expansion range upon expansion. So, upon expansion,
the folded struts 20 expand circumferentially and become hoop-like so that
maximum radial strength is achieved. The flexible members 30 placed
between the folded struts improve the stent deliverability in the unexpanded
dimension of the stent 10. These flexible members are longitudinally
compliant so that foreshortening is minimized upon expansion.</p>
    <p num="0029">In use, therefore, the stent 10 of the present invention is placed on a
balloon catheter and is snaked through the vasculature to be placed into a
lesion site in an artery, typically a coronary artery. Because the flexible
sections 30 are so substantially flexible, they are able to navigate tortuous
lesions with relative ease. Once in place, the balloon catheter is expanded by
conventional means. Upon expansion, the struts 25 in the folded strut sections
20 expand to obtain a hoop-like shape. In addition, these members expand
longitudinally, so that any reduction in foreshortening is negated. Of course,
upon expansion, the flexible members 35 straighten so that there is further
strength achieved by the stent in the straightened and rigid positions. </p>
    <p num="0030">A variation of the present invention can be seen in the stent 50 of
Figures 2 ("angled" version") and 3 ("straight" version). There, the radial
strength sections 120 are achieved with generally straight members 115,
although these members do not have folded struts. Connection between
generally straight members 115 is made by connecting the generally straight
members 115 to the more flexible members 125, much like the connection
made involving the connecting members of the first embodiment of Figure 1.</p>
    <p num="0031">The members that reduce foreshortening are angled members 130
which are seen to be 180° out of phase with one another. The connection
between the flexible members is made at the end of a particular relatively
non-flexible member and at the distal end of a particular angled canted
member 130. Now, when the columns comprised of relatively rigid
members 115 expand, the length of these members 130 shorten. But, the
longitudinal lengths of the canted members 130 are placed at an angle
compared to the longitudinal axis of the stent 50. So, upon expansion,
these canted members 130 actually <i>lengthen</i> with respect to the longitudinal
axis of the stent 50. The net result is that no foreshortening occurs upon
expansion of stent 50.</p>
    <p num="0032">The canted members 130 are angled in order to both: increase
flexibility; and to provide additional resistance on the balloon surface. This
arrangement helps prevent what is known as "dogboning" or exposure of
leading edge of any of the strut members 75 contained at either end of the
stent 50. In addition, this configuration also prevents slippage of the stent
along the balloon surface. The canted members 130 are canted in opposite 
phase (i.e., with a phase change of 180°) to one another, in order to negate
any torsional effects on the struts 75,85 along the length of the stent. These
particular members can be crimped to a lower profile than the more rigid
members, in order to ensure increased retention of the stent on the surface
of a balloon catheter. Further, the configuration described herein has a
uniquely folded configuration reducing any risk of "flaring" of the edges of
struts 75,85 during the traversal of the lumen.</p>
    <p num="0033">It is to be noticed that the longitudinal position (the "order") of the
columns can be changed if one desires a smaller initial profile. That is, if
one desires that the profile be smaller, it is possible to remove the more
rigid sections 120 (or a portion thereof,) and replace them with the generally
canted sections 130.</p>
    <p num="0034">It is also to be noticed that the wave amplitudes of the struts in a
particular column are not kept constant. The wave amplitudes, defined
herein as "W," can be lengthened where permitted by the geometry. For
instance, notice the space S created between one set of strut members A
and a second set of strut members B. This particular configuration allows
an increased expansion range around the unexpanded circumference of the
stent, while maintaining an appropriate expansion area associated with the
metallic struts placed around of the circumference of the stent. Such
optimization of the strut surface area is important to ensure adequate
coverage of the lesion upon expansion of the stent.</p>
    <p num="0035">The stent 50 of this particular embodiment is expanded in much the
same way as the stent 10 of Figure 1. When expansion occurs via the 
balloon catheter, the canted members 130 tend to lengthen and prevent
foreshortening of the stent 50; the relatively rigid members 120 tend to
shorten in the longitudinal direction, but in so doing provide a greater rigidity
for the fully expanded stent. It is to be understood however, that in the
expansion of both stents 10, 50 the ability to flexibly navigate the
vasculature is enhanced from configuration of either stent 10, 50, as the
case may be. All the while, the likelihood of stent foreshortening upon
expansion is greatly reduced.</p>
    <p num="0036">As can be seen in Figure 4, one can also provide for a stent 175 that
does not contain canted sections. Yet, the stent 175 expands with
decreased foreshortening along its length due to the unique geometry of the
stent 175. Here, the stent struts 180, 190 provide for a relatively constant
length along the longitudinal axis. (In other words, the longitudinal
dimension of the struts 180, 190 in combination remains relatively constant,
whether in the expanded or unexpanded condition.) In this fashion, upon
expansion, the stent 175 maintains a generally constant length in any of its
expanded, unexpanded or partially expanded conditions.</p>
    <p num="0037">Figures 4 and 5 show yet another embodiment of the design of a
similar stent 200. Here, the connector 250 is shaped like an "N," much after
the same fashion of "N"-shaped connectors found commercially in the Bx
Velocity ® stent sold by Cordis Corporation, Miami Lakes FL and which is at
least somewhat characterized in Serial No. 09/192,101, filed November 13,
2000, now US Patent No. 6,190,403 B1, and Serial No. 09/636,071, filed
August 10, 2000, both of which are assigned to Cordis Corporation, and
incorporated herein by reference. </p>
    <p num="0038">In the stent 200, the relatively rigid sections R contain unequal struts
210, 220 of lengths a, b, as can best be seen in Figure 4. Moreover, as can
be seen in Figure 5, this strut pattern is formed so that the attachment
points a at the end of the flexible connectors 250 can be located at any point
along the struts 210, 220 rigid section. In this fashion, when the stent is
expanded, the relatively more rigid section R "holds" the connector 250
along the surface of the lesion, so that tenacity of the stent, and its
concomitant support are both maintained to a high degree at the situs of the
lesion. Yet, in the unexpanded configuration, the "N"-shaped flexible
connectors 250 are able to guide the stent 200 around the curvature of
generally any tortuous vessel, including tortuous coronary arteries.</p>
    <p num="0039">As can be seen from Figures 4 and 5, the alternative embodiment stent
200 is also capable of reducing foreshortening along its entire length. This
stent contains relatively rigid sections R and relatively flexible sections F
containing connectors 250. (The flexible sections F are in the form of
undulating longitudinal connectors 250.) The relatively rigid sections R
generally contain a slotted form, created with struts 210, 220 around a slot S.
The relatively rigid sections R contain these interlaced struts 210, 220, which
are of varying longitudinal dimensional length.</p>
    <p num="0040">As can be seen from the figures, in some radial positions, the struts 210
are made longer. In other radial positions, the struts 220 are made shorter.
However, the shorter struts 220 are of a constant length b in the longitudinal
dimension, and in the fashion in which they connect to the relatively flexible
connectors 250. Also, as described above, the relatively more rigid sections R 
maintain the relatively more flexible sections F at a generally constant
longitudinal length due to the friction maintained by the relatively more rigid
sections R on a balloon portion of an angioplasty type balloon catheter.
Accordingly, upon expansion, the constant length b, in conjunction with the
generally constant length of the relatively flexible connector 250, causes the
stent 200 to maintain a relatively constant longitudinal dimension L in any
diameter to which it is expanded. As can be appreciated, the maintenance of a
constant length is desirable from the perspective of secure, repeatable
placement of the stent within the vasculature.</p>
    <p num="0041">Continuing to describe the stent 200 of Figures 4 and 5, the flexible
sections F operate with the behavior of the flexible connectors 250 acting in the
fashion of "N"-shaped flexible connectors of similar type. That is, the flexibility
of the stent 200 is focused in this area F so that one is able to traverse tighter
lesions using such a configuration. The relatively stronger sections R are
capable of expansion to a stronger plastically deformed dimension, so that in
this fashion the stent 200 is capable of supporting the arterial wall. Even
though the longitudinal dimensions of the struts 210, 220 in the relatively
stronger sections R are of unequal length, such a configuration does not
diminish radial support in the expanded condition. Accordingly, it can be
appreciated that a stent of this shape will adequately support the arterial walls
at the lesion site, while maintaining radial flexibility, and longitudinal length.</p>
    <p num="0042">As can be best seen in Fig. 7, yet another alternate embodiment of
the present invention is described. In Figure 7, there is contained a stent
300 much like the Bx Velocity ® stent sold by Cordis Corporation, Miami
Lakes, Florida. In Figure 7 there is contained on the stent 300 generally 
flexible connector members 310 connected to generally rigid radial strut
members 320. The connector members 320 are generally formed in the
shape of the letter "N", and the struts 310 are generally slots formed in a
radial fashion around the circumference of the stent. The connection made
between the flexible connectors 320 and the radial strut members 310 is
formed from a living hinge 330. This living hinge 330 contains outer radial
arc 332 and an inner radial arc 334. In the expanded configuration, the
radial arcs 332, 334 move away one from the other, so that the overall
length of the living hinge 330 actually increases upon expansion.</p>
    <p num="0043">Known conventional means, such as angioplasty balloons, or the
balloon on a stent delivery system expands the stent 300 of the present
invention. Upon expansion, there are provided a number of benefits by the
stent 300 of the present invention. First, as explained above, there is
reduced foreshortening of the stent 300, since the outer radial arc 332 in
fact does not foreshorten. Since it lengthens slightly, the overall length of
the stent 300 is maintained to its general nominal length. There is also
provided increased radial strength since the radial arcs 332, 334 at their
connection between the flexible and radial struts 320, 310, (both inner and
outer radial arcs 334, 332) combine to give superior strength in the arcs'
section; the radial strut 310 provides for optimal strength in the radial
direction since it is parallel to the loading direction of the stent 300, thereby
creating a "hoop" a circumference C of the stent. Also, because the radial
arcs are able to accept greater forces, there is reduced strain for the
equivalent strength designed for a stents. In all, the stent 300 of this
embodiment provides for at least equivalent radial strength, less
foreshortening and reduced strain when compared to current stents. </p>
    <p num="0044">As can be seen from figures 8, 9 and 10, there is provided yet
another embodiment of the stent 400 in the present invention. Again, the
stent 400 provides for generally stronger radial sections R comprising radial
struts 410, which are generally slotted in alternating fashion around the
circumference of the stent. The flexible connector members 420 are similar
to the flexible connector members as seen in Figure 7, and also to the
flexible connector members of the Bx Velocity ® stent. However, these
flexible connector members 420 are connected to the radial struts generally
somewhere near the midpoint of the radial struts 410. In this fashion, upon
expansion the length of the connector members 420 remains independent of
the shortening or lengthening of the radial struts 410. In this way, the overall
length of the stent is maintained, as seen from the schematics in Figures 9
and 10.</p>
    <p num="0045">Due to this overall ability to maintain the length of stent 400, the
radial struts 410 provide for radial strength only, and do not contribute in one
way or another to any foreshortening of the stent. Also, the radial struts 410
are formed from a generally "wavy" pattern. This wavy pattern is useful in
helping to reduce the crimp profile of the stent 400 on the balloon. This
results from the relative smooth attachment of the radial struts 410 to the
flexible connectors 420. Further, having such an arrangement reduces the
strain placed on the struts 420 upon expansion. This reduced strain is
achieved due to the location of the connection of the struts 420 to the struts
410. Because there is relatively little movement of the struts 420 in the
longitudinal direction, there is relatively little strain placed on these struts 
during expansion. The radial arcs 415 of struts 410 can be ideally placed in
a "shifted" configuration so that the stent is easier to crimp on a balloon.</p>
    <p num="0046">Further, this can be seen from Figure 8, that the radial strut members
410 are attached to the flexible connectors 420 so that the flexible
connectors 420 generally proceed along a "spiral" pattern S around the
length of the stent 400. The connection points 422 of the flexible connectors
420 are placed in a diagonal fashion on struts 410 so as to enhance
flexibility. Generally connectors 422 are located in a midpoint of a strut 410.
When the connectors 422 are placed past the midpoint of strut 410 (i.e.
farther from the midpoint of strut 410 then from the direction of connector
420), the nominal stent strength should increase upon expansion when
compared to the above described stent. This arrangement reduces
foreshortening, as described above. Further, the arrangement in no wise
affects any torsion on the stent as it is applied to the lumen by the balloon
catheter. Friction of the balloon to struts 410 maintains the struts 410 (and
their opposite struts 420) in the same general radial position throughout
expansion. By reducing any concern of stent torsion, there is also a
reduced concern of overall slippage of the balloon. Even though the
connector members 420 are not aligned with one another, they are
maintained in their respective positions on the balloon surface. Upon
expansion, struts 420 lock into place, as the stent 400 is placed, giving an
increased strength in the lumen.</p>
    <p num="0047">From Figures 8 and 9, we see that the midpoint of a connector 420 is
important to maintaining length. The greater the distance from connector 420
to the midpoint M, on the side of the connection between struts 410, 420, the 
greater the potential for shortening of the stent. This creates a need to solve
any shortening by other means, absent the solution described herein.</p>
    <p num="0048">It is to be understood that various modifications to the stent 400 of
Figures 8, 9 and 10 are possible without departing from the invention herein.
For instance, the connectors 420 can be placed intermittently about the stent
400 circumference, and not at every incidence of a radial strut 410. Also, while
the radial struts 410 are generally 90º out of phase between one series of
struts 410a and the next 410b, it is foreseeable to place them between 30º and
150° out of place. When so placed, the strut 410 can be "encouraged" to bend
in a particular fashion, which may be preferential in the design of a particularly
intended stent.</p>
    <p num="0049">These stents can be manufactured by know conventional means, such
as laser etching, electrical discharge machining (EDM), photochemical etching,
etc. However, there is also disclosed in the invention herein a novel method of
performing photochemical resistance etching of the tube from which the stent
is to be made. This novel method allows one to produce a stent with variable
geometry in the three dimensions of the strut, that is, along its length, across
the circumferential dimension, and along its depth (or radial dimension.) This
method starts with a standard photochemical machining process.</p>
    <p num="0050">The new process consists of cutting the stent using photochemical
etching, cleaning it, and then coating it with a photoresist. The photoresist
coating is applied in circular shapes 290, as can be appreciated from Figure 6.
These shapes 290 are intentionally figured to be of varying dimension in their
radius. Then, a photoresist image is developed on the surface of the 
cylindrical metallic tube T from which the stent starts. This photoresist image
is developed in a controlled fashion using known means. The development of
the photoresist in this fashion allows a controlled variable etching rate at select
positions along the cylindrical metallic tube.</p>
    <p num="0051">As previously stated, the novel photoresist image can be seen in Figure
6. This photoresist image consists of a series of circular regions of photoresist
material 310, which are shaped in a variable diameter as desired for
manufacture. These photoresist images 310 are configured at variable
distances D from one another. As the diameter of the circular photoresist
pattern 310 decreases, and its distance from other photoresist patterns 310
increases, the etching rate of that area of the stent increases. Thus, by
strategically placing the photoresist patterns 310 on the stent, one can produce
any variable dimension in any direction along the stent.</p>
    <p num="0052">This photoresist pattern 310 variation results in a variation in the metal
of the stent removed during the etching process. This process can be used to
locally change the geometry of the metallic tube.</p>
    <p num="0053">In this fashion, one can envision making a stent of variable
circumferential width, radial depth or longitudinal length. As such, one can
impart varying flexibilities along the stent longitude, as well as varying
strengths so that a stent can be configured for emplacement at various
locations within the body.</p>
