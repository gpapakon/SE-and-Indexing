    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">This invention relates to an optical junction connector
device and an optical junction connector used in the field of
optical communication for an OA equipment, an FA equipment,
an on-vehicle equipment and so on.</p>
    <heading>Background Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">In a conventional optical junction connector for
connecting optical fibers together, the single optical fiber
is received and held in a single ferrule. When the ferrule
of the optical junction connector is inserted into a ferrule
receiving portion of a mating optical junction connector, and
is connected thereto, the optical fiber, held in the ferrule,
is butted against the optical fiber, held in the ferrule
receiving portion, and is optically connected thereto.</p>
    <p num="0003">However, when the number of optical fibers to be connected
increased, it was necessary to use a plurality of pairs of optical
junction connectors or to provide a plurality of ferrules in
a single optical junction connector, and because of the increased
number of the component parts, the complicated shape and so 
on, the efficiency of the connecting operation was lowered,
and the cost increased.</p>
    <p num="0004">However, if there is used a construction in which a
plurality of optical fibers are received and held in each of
a cylindrical ferrule and a ferrule receiving portion, and the
plurality of pairs of optical fibers are connected in a butted
manner, there is a fear that in the connected condition, the
ferrule is turned within the ferrule receiving portion, so that
the axes of each mating pair of optical fibers are disposed
out of alignment with each other at their connected ends, and
this would be the cause of an increased connection loss.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0005">The above problems have been solved by an optical junction
connector device according to a first aspect of the invention,
which comprises a first optical junction connector including
a first connector housing, and a ferrule formed on and projecting
from the first connector housing, the ferrule having a plurality
of fiber insertion holes for respectively receiving end portions
of optical fibers; and a second optical junction connector
including a second connector housing for holding end portions
of a plurality of optical fibers, the second connector housing
having a ferrule guide hole for receiving the ferrule so as
to guide the end portions of the optical fibers, received in
the ferrule, toward the end portions of the optical fibers, 
held in the second connector housing, respectively; wherein
the ferrule is formed into a non-circular transverse
cross-sectional shape, and the ferrule guide hole is formed
into a non-circular transverse cross-sectional shape
corresponding to the non-circular transverse cross-sectional
shape of the ferrule.</p>
    <p num="0006">According to another aspect of the invention, preferably,
the ferrule has a generally oval transverse cross-sectional
shape, and the ferrule guide hole has a generally oval transverse
cross-sectional shape corresponding to the oval transverse
cross-sectional shape of the ferrule.</p>
    <p num="0007">According to another aspect of the invention, preferably,
an elongate guide projection is formed on one of an outer
peripheral surface of the ferrule and an inner peripheral surface
of the ferrule guide hole, and extends in a direction of inserting
connection of the ferrule and the ferrule guide hole to each
other, whereas a guide groove for receiving the elongate guide
projection so as to guide the same in the direction of inserting
connection is formed in the other.</p>
    <p num="0008">According to another aspect of the invention, preferably,
the first connector housing includes a protecting hood portion
which projects forwardly beyond the ferrule in surrounding
relation thereto. According to another aspect of the invention,
preferably, the ferrule guide hole is formed in a ferrule
receiving portion formed on and projecting from the second 
connector housing, and the protecting hood portion is so shaped
as to be fitted on the ferrule receiving portion.</p>
    <p num="0009">According to another aspect of the invention, there is
provided an optical junction connector including a connector
housing, and a ferrule formed on and projecting from the
connector housing, the ferrule having a plurality of fiber
holding holes for respectively receiving end portions of optical
fibers; wherein the ferrule is formed into a non-circular
transverse cross-sectional shape.</p>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="0012">A preferred embodiment of an optical junction connector
device of the present invention will now be described.</p>
    <p num="0013">As shown in Figs. 1 to 3, this optical junction connector
device comprises a first optical junction connector 1 and a
second optical junction connector 40 which can be connected
together.</p>
    <p num="0014">As shown in Figs. 1 to 3 and Figs. 4A to 4C, the first
optical junction connector 1 includes a first connector housing
2, and a ferrule portion 10 of a generally pillar-shape formed
on and projecting from this connector housing 2.</p>
    <p num="0015">The first connector housing 2 is made of a resin or the
like, and the ferrule portion 10 is integrally formed in a
projected manner on a front portion of a housing body portion
3 of a generally rectangular parallelepiped shape flattened
in a direction of the width thereof. A protecting hood portion
5 is formed integrally on this housing body portion in
surrounding relation to the ferrule portion 10.</p>
    <p num="0016">The ferrule portion 10 is formed into a pillar-like body
of a generally oval transverse cross-sectional shape (that is,
a generally oval shape when viewed from the front side thereof)
flattened in the direction of the width. A plurality of fiber
insertion holes 11h each for receiving an optical fiber 81,
exposed at an end portion of an optical fiber cord 80, are formed 
in the ferrule portion 10, and extend along the axis of the
ferrule portion. In this embodiment, a pair of right and left
fiber insertion holes 11h is formed in the ferrule portion 10.
A pair of cord receiving holes 2h for respectively receiving
sheaths 82 of the optical fiber cords 80 are formed in the first
connector housing 2, and are disposed rearward of the fiber
insertion holes 11h in coaxial relation thereto, respectively.
When the pair of optical fiber cords 80, each having the optical
fiber 81 exposed at its end portion, are inserted into the
respective cord receiving holes 2h and the respective fiber
insertion holes 11h from the rear side of the first connector
housing 2, the end portions of the optical fibers 81, exposed
respectively at the end portions of the optical fiber cords
80, are inserted and held in the fiber insertion holes 11h,
respectively, and at the same time those portions of the sheaths
82, disposed immediately adjacent respectively to the exposed
end portions of the optical fibers 81, are inserted and held
in the cord receiving holes 2h, respectively. In this condition,
the optical fiber cords 80 are positioned and held by retaining
means such as a predetermined stopper or an adhesive. In this
embodiment, the sheaths 82 are engaged respectively in
engagement grooves 35a of a generally U-shape formed in a stopper
35, thereby positioning and holding the optical fiber cords
80. The end surfaces of the optical fibers 81, disposed at
the distal end of the ferrule portion 10, are subjected to a 
mirror finished processing. Those portions of the pair of
optical fiber cords 80, extending rearward from the first
connector housing 2, are covered with a sheath 83, and are held
in parallel, contiguous relation to each other.</p>
    <p num="0017">The ferrule portion 10 may be separate from the first
connector housing 2, and may be supported on the front end of
the housing body 3 in a projected manner, with its proximal
end embedded in this front end.</p>
    <p num="0018">The protecting hood portion 5 projects forwardly beyond
the distal end of the ferrule portion 10 in surrounding relation
thereto. The end surfaces of the optical fibers 81, exposed
at the distal end of the ferrule portion 10, are protected by
this protecting hood portion 5.</p>
    <p num="0019">The protecting hood portion 5 is so shaped as to fit on
a ferrule receiving portion 50 (described later). More
specifically, an insertion hole 5h of a generally oval transverse
cross-sectional shape, corresponding to the shape of the outer
peripheral surface of the ferrule receiving portion 50, is formed
in the protecting hood portion 5. When the ferrule portion
10 is inserted into the ferrule receiving portion 50, the
protecting hood portion 5 is fitted on the ferrule receiving
portion 50.</p>
    <p num="0020">An engagement piece portion 7 is formed on the upper surface
of the first connector housing 2, and extends rearwardly from
the front portion of this first connector housing. An 
upwardly-projecting engagement projection 8 is formed on a
middle portion of the engagement piece portion 7, and an
operating portion 9 is formed at a rear end of the engagement
piece portion 7. When the first optical junction connector
1 and the second optical junction connector 40 are connected
together, the engagement projection 8 is engaged with an
engagement projection 56 on the second optical junction
connector 40, thereby maintaining the mutually-connected
condition of the first and second optical junction connectors
1 and 40 (see Fig. 3). In this condition, when the operating
portion 9 is pressed down to elastically deform the engagement
piece portion 7 downwardly, the engagement of the engagement
projection 8 with the engagement projection 56 is canceled,
so that the connection between the first and second optical
junction connectors 1 and 40 is canceled.</p>
    <p num="0021">Guide grooves 2b of a channel-shaped cross-section are
formed respectively in opposite side surfaces of the first
connector housing 2, and these guide grooves 2b can receive
elongate guide projections 55b, formed on a second connector
housing 42 (described later) , respectively, so as to guide these
elongate guide projections 55b in a direction of connection
of the mating second optical junction connector 40.</p>
    <p num="0022">As shown in Figs. 1 to 3 and Figs. 5A to 5C, the second
optical junction connector 40 includes the second connector
housing 42 in which a ferrule guide hole 51h is formed. </p>
    <p num="0023">The second connector housing 42 is made of a resin or
the like, and the ferrule receiving portion 50 is integrally
formed in a projected manner on a front portion of a housing
body portion 43 of a generally rectangular parallelepiped shape
flattened in a direction of the width thereof. A housing hood
portion 55 is formed integrally on this housing body portion
in surrounding relation to the ferrule receiving portion 50.</p>
    <p num="0024">End portions of a plurality of optical fibers 81 are held
in the housing body portion 43. In this embodiment, that is,
in a specific formof the invention described below, end portions
of a pair of optical fibers 81 are held in this housing body
portion, and are exposed to the ferrule guide hole 51h.</p>
    <p num="0025">More specifically, a receiving hole 43h is formed in the
housing body portion 43, and is open to a rear end thereof,
and a fiber holding member 45 is received and held in this
receiving hole 43h (see Figs. 3 and 6). The fiber holding member
45 includes a body portion 46 of a generally rectangular
parallelepiped shape flattened in a direction of the width
thereof, and a fiber end-holding portion 47 is formed on and
projects from a front end of this body portion 46. The fiber
end-holding portion 47 is formed into a pillar-like body of
a generally oval transverse cross-sectional shape flattened
in a direction of the width thereof. A pair of right and left
fiber insertion holes 47h each for receiving the optical fiber
81, exposed at an end portion of an optical fiber cord 80, are 
formed in the fiber end-holding portion 47, and extend along
the axis of this fiber end-holding portion. A pair of cord
receiving holes 46h for respectively receiving sheaths 82 of
the optical fiber cords 80 are formed in the body portion 46,
and are disposed rearward of the fiber insertion holes 47h in
coaxial relation thereto, respectively. When the pair of
optical fiber cords 80, each having the optical fiber 81 exposed
at its end portion, are inserted into the respective cord
receiving holes 46h and the respective fiber insertion holes
47h from the rear side of the fiber holding member 45, the end
portions of the optical fibers 81, exposed respectively at the
end portions of the optical fiber cords 80, are inserted and
held in the fiber insertion holes 47h, respectively, and at
the same time those portions of the sheaths 82, disposed
immediately adjacent respectively to the exposed end portions
of the optical fibers 81, are inserted and held in the cord
receiving holes 46h, respectively. In this condition, the
optical fiber cords 80 are positioned and held by retaining
means such as a predetermined stopper or an adhesive. In this
embodiment, the optical fiber cords are positioned and held
by the use of a stopper 49 similar to the stopper 35.</p>
    <p num="0026">Engagement projections 45a are formed respectively on
opposite side surfaces and an upper surface of the fiber holding
member 45 at a rear portion thereof. Engagement grooves 43ha
of a channel-shaped cross-section, in which the engagement 
projections 45a are engageable, respectively, are formed
respectively in opposite inner side surfaces and an inner upper
surface of the receiving hole 43h in the housing body portion
43. The fiber holding member 45 is pushed into the receiving
hole 43h from the rear side of the housing body portion 43,
and is abutted at its front surface against an inner end surface
of the receiving hole 43h, with the engagement projections 45a
engaged respectively in the engagement grooves 43ha, and in
this manner, the fiber holding member 45 is received and held
in the receiving hole 43h.</p>
    <p num="0027">The ferrule receiving portion 50 is formed into
pillar-like body of a generally oval transverse cross-sectional
shape, and the ferrule guide hole 51h is formed in this ferrule
receiving portion, and extends along the axis thereof. The
ferrule guide hole 51h also has a generally oval transverse
cross-sectional shape, and an inner portion of this ferrule
guide hole is so shaped as to receive the fiber end-holding
portion 47. When the fiber holding member 45 is inserted in
the receiving hole 43h, the fiber end-holding portion 47 is
inserted into the ferrule guide hole 51h from the inner end
side thereof, and the distal end of the fiber end-holding portion
47 is disposed at a generally middle portion of the ferrule
guide hole 51h (see Fig. 3). As a result, the end portions
of the optical fibers 81, held in the fiber end-holding portion
47, are held in the inner end portion of the ferrule guide hole 
51h in such a posture as to be butted respectively against the
optical fibers 81 held in the ferrule portion 10. The distal
end portion of the ferrule guide hole 51h is so shaped as to
receive the ferrule portion 10, and when the first and second
optical junction connectors 1 and 40 are connected together,
the ferrule portion 10 is inserted into the ferrule guide hole
51h from the distal end side thereof, and the distal end of
the ferrule portion 10 is butted against the distal end of the
fiber end-holding portion 47, so that the pair of optical fibers
81 in the ferrule portion 10 are optically connected respectively
to the pair of optical fibers 81 in the fiber end-holding portion
47.</p>
    <p num="0028">The housing hood portion 55 has such a generally
rectangular tubular shape as to fit on the first connector
housing 2.</p>
    <p num="0029">The engagement projection 56 for engagement with the
engagement projection 8 on the first connector housing 2 is
formed on an inner upper surface of the housing hood portion
55 at a front end thereof. When the first and second optical
junction connectors 1 and 40 are connected together, the
engagement projection 8 is engaged with the engagement
projection 56, thereby maintaining the connected condition of
the first and second optical junction connectors 1 and 40.</p>
    <p num="0030">The elongate guide projections 55b for insertion
respectively into the guide grooves 2b are formed on opposite 
inner side surfaces of the housing hood portion 55, respectively.
When the first and second optical junction connectors 1 and
40 are connected together, the elongate guide projections 55b
are inserted respectively into the guide grooves 2b, and are
guided by these guide grooves, respectively, and therefore the
first and second optical junction connectors 1 and 40, while
guided without being inclined relative to each other, are
connected together.</p>
    <p num="0031">The operation for connecting the first and second optical
junction connectors 1 and 40 together is carried out in the
following manner.</p>
    <p num="0032">Namely, when the first and second optical junction
connectors 1 and 40 are connected together, first, the protecting
hood portion 5 of the first connector housing 2 is fitted into
the housing hood portion 55 of the second connector housing
42. At this time, the elongate guide projections 55b on the
second connector housing 42 are inserted into and guided by
the guide grooves 2b, formed in the first connector housing
2, respectively. When the first connector housing 2 is further
inserted deeper into the second connector housing 42, the
protecting hood portion 5 is fitted on the ferrule receiving
portion 50, and then the ferrule portion 10 is inserted into
the ferrule guide hole 51h in the ferrule receiving portion
50. When the first connector housing 2 is inserted into the
predetermined deepest position within the second connector 
housing 42, the distal end of the ferrule portion 10 is butted
against the distal end of the fiber end-holding portion 47 within
the ferrule guide hole 51h, so that the pair of optical fibers
81 in the ferrule portion 10 are optically connected respectively
to the pair of optical fibers 81 in the fiber end-holding portion
47. At this time, the engagement projection 8 is engaged with
the engagement projection 56, thereby holding the first and
second optical junction connectors 1 and 40 against withdrawal
from each other.</p>
    <p num="0033">In this condition, when the operating portion 9 is pressed
down, the engagement of the engagement projection 8 with the
engagement portion 56 is canceled, so that the connection between
the first and second optical junction connectors 1 and 40 is
canceled.</p>
    <p num="0034">In the optical junction connector device of the above
construction, the plurality of fiber insertion holes 11h are
formed in the single ferrule portion 10, and when this ferrule
portion 10 is inserted into the ferrule guide hole 51h to be
connected thereto, each mating pair of optical fibers 81 are
connected together. Therefore, the optical junction
connectors 1 and 40 can be formed into a smaller size as compared
with the conventional optical junction connector in which one
optical fiber is held in one ferrule. And besides, the number
of the component parts can be reduced, and the shape can be
simplified as compared with the conventional optical junction 
connector.</p>
    <p num="0035">In addition, the ferrule portion 10 has the generally
oval transverse cross-sectional shape, and the ferrule guide
hole 51h has the generally oval transverse cross-sectional shape
corresponding to the transverse cross-sectional shape of the
ferrule portion 10. Therefore, when the ferrule portion 10
is inserted in the ferrule guide hole 51h, the ferrule portion
10 is prevented from turning about its axis within the ferrule
guide hole 51h. Therefore, the misalignment of the axes of
the optical fibers 81 (held respectively in the fiber insertion
holes 11h in the ferrule portion 10 of the first optical junction
connector 1) relative to the axes of the optical fibers 81 (held
in the second optical junction connector 40) due to the turning
movement of the ferrule portion is prevented, and a loss of
connection between each mating pair of optical fibers can be
reduced as much as possible.</p>
    <p num="0036">In this embodiment, the ferrule portion 10 has the
generally oval transverse cross-sectional shape, and the
ferrule guide hole 51h has the generally oval transverse
cross-sectional shape corresponding to the transverse
cross-sectional shape of the ferrule portion 10. However, it
is not always necessary to form these into such a generally
oval transverse cross-sectional shape. For example, the
ferrule portion 10 and the ferrule guide hole 51h may be formed
into a polygonal transverse cross-sectional shape, such as a 
generally triangular or a generally square shape, or a generally
key hole-like transverse cross-sectional shape (in which case
the ferrule portion 10 includes a generally cylindrical body,
and a rotation-preventing projection formed on one side of an
outer peripheral surface of this cylindrical body, and the
ferrule guide hole 51h has a circular transverse cross-sectional
shape, and a groove for receiving the rotation-preventing
projection is formed in an inner peripheral surface of this
ferrule guide hole). Namely, the ferrule portion 10, as well
as the ferrule guide hole 51h, is formed into a non-circular
transverse cross-sectional shape so that the ferrule portion
10, when inserted in the ferrule guide hole 51h, will not turn
or rotate about the axis thereof.</p>
    <p num="0037">The first connector housing 2 includes the protecting
hood portion 5 which projects forwardly beyond the distal end
of the ferrule portion 10 in surrounding relation thereto, and
therefore the end surfaces of the optical fibers 81, exposed
at the distal end of the ferrule portion 10, can be protected
by the protecting hood portion 5 . Therefore, the optical fibers
81 are prevented from damage and the like.</p>
    <p num="0038">And besides, the protecting hood portion 5 is so shaped
as to fit on the ferrule receiving portion 50, and therefore
when the first and second optical junction connectors 1 and
40 are connected together, the protecting hood portion 5 is
fitted on the ferrule receiving portion 50. Therefore, the 
ferrule can be more firmly kept inserted in the ferrule guide
hole. Therefore, the ferrule portion 10 is prevented from
jolting in the ferrule guide hole 51h, and also the mechanical
strength of connection between the ferrule portion 10 and the
ferrule receiving portion 50 can be increased. And besides,
by preventing such jolting, a connection loss can be stably
kept to a low level.</p>
    <p num="0039">However, the protecting hood portion 5 is not an essential
constituent element, and the provision of the protecting hood
portion 5 may be omitted as in a first optical junction connector
1B of a first modification shown in Figs. 7A to 7C. This first
optical junction connector 1B is similar in construction to
the first optical junction connector 1 except that the provision
of the protecting hood portion 5 is omitted. In this case,
with respect to the second optical junction connector 40, the
ferrule guide hole 51h does not need to be formed in the ferrule
receiving portion 50 formed in a projected manner on the second
connector housing 42, and a ferrule guide hole may be formed
directly in the housing body portion 43 of the second connector
housing 42.</p>
    <p num="0040">Figs. 8A to 8C and Figs. 9A to 9C show an optical junction
connector device of a second modification in which elongate
guide projections 52c are formed on one of an outer peripheral
surface of a ferrule portion 10C and an inner peripheral surface
of a ferrule guide hole 51hC, and extend in a direction of 
inserting connection of the ferrule portion to the ferrule guide
hole, whereas guide grooves 12C for respectively receiving the
elongate guide projections 52C so as to guide the same in the
direction of inserting connection are formed in the other. The
optical junction connector device of this second modification
is similar in construction to the optical junction connector
device of the above embodiment except the following differences
and except that the provision of the protecting hood portion
5 is omitted.</p>
    <p num="0041">In this second modification, the guide grooves 12C are
formed respectively in upper and lower portions of the outer
peripheral surface of the ferrule portion 10C of a first optical
junction connector 1C (shown in Figs. 8A to 8C), and extend
in the direction of inserting connection (in the direction of
the axis of the ferrule portion 10C), the guide grooves 12C
being disposed centrally of the width of the ferrule portion
10C. The elongate guide projections 52C for insertion
respectively into the guide grooves 12C so as to slide therealong
are formed respectively on upper and lower portions of the inner
peripheral surface of the ferrule guide hole 51hC, and extend
in the direction of inserting connection (in the direction of
the axis of the ferrule guide hole 51hC), the elongate guide
projections 52C being disposed centrally of the width of the
ferrule guide hole 51hC.</p>
    <p num="0042">In this optical junction connector device, when the first 
optical junction connector 1C and the second optical junction
connector 40C are connected together, the ferrule portion 10C
is inserted into the ferrule guide hole 51hC while the elongate
guide projections 52C are inserted respectively into the guide
grooves 12C, and are guided by these guide grooves, respectively.
Therefore, ends of optical fibers 81 in the ferrule portion
10C are more positively guided respectively toward ends of
optical fibers 81 in the ferrule guide hole 51hC, and the
misalignment of the optical axes of each mating pair of optical
fibers 81 relative to each other is more positively prevented,
so that a loss of connection between each mating pair of optical
fibers 81 can be reduced as much as possible.</p>
    <p num="0043">The optical junction connector 1C, shown in Figs. 8A to
8C, may be provided with a protecting hood portion similar to
the protecting hood portion 5 of the above embodiment.</p>
    <p num="0044">As described above, in the optical junction connector
device, the ferrule is formed into the non-circular transverse
cross-sectional shape, and the ferrule guide hole is formed
into the non-circular transverse cross-sectional shape
corresponding to the non-circular transverse cross-sectional
shape of the ferrule. Therefore, the ferrule, when inserted
in the ferrule guide hole, is prevented from turning about its
axis within the ferrule guide hole. Therefore, when connecting
the plurality of mating pairs of optical fibers by the use of
the single ferrule, the misalignment of the axes of the optical 
fibers (held respectively in the fiber insertion holes in the
ferrule of the first optical junction connector) relative to
the axes of the optical fibers (held in the second optical
junction connector) due to the turning movement of the ferrule
is prevented, and a loss of connection between each mating pair
of optical fibers can be reduced as much as possible.</p>
    <p num="0045">In the optical function connector device, the ferrule
is inserted into the ferrule receiving portion while the elongate
guide projection is inserted in and guided by the guide groove.
Therefore, the end portions of the optical fibers in the ferrule
are more positively guided respectively toward the end portions
of the optical fibers in the ferrule receiving portion, and
the misalignment of the optical axes of each mating pair of
optical fibers relative to each other is more positively
prevented, so that a loss of connection between each mating
pair of optical fibers can be reduced as much as possible.</p>
    <p num="0046">In the optical junction connector device, the first
connector housing includes the protecting hood portion which
projects forwardly beyond the distal end of the ferrule in
surrounding relation thereto. Therefore, the end surfaces of
the optical fibers, exposed at the distal end of the ferrule,
can be protected by this protecting hood portion.</p>
    <p num="0047">In the optical junction connector device, the ferrule
guide hole is formed in the ferrule receiving portion formed
on and projecting from the second connector housing, and the 
protecting hood portion is so shaped as to be fitted on this
ferrule receiving portion. Therefore, the ferrule can be more
firmly kept inserted in the ferrule guide hole.</p>
    <p num="0048">In the optical junction connector, the ferrule is formed
into the non-circular transverse cross-sectional shape.
Therefore, when the ferrule is inserted into the ferrule guide
hole having the non-circular transverse cross-sectional shape
corresponding to the non-circular transverse cross-sectional
shape of the ferrule, the ferrule is prevented from turning
about its axis within the ferrule guide hole. Therefore, the
misalignment of the axes of the optical fibers (in the ferrule)
relative to the axes of the optical fibers (which are held in
the ferrule guide hole, and are to be connected respectively
to the above optical fibers) due to the turning movement of
the ferrule is prevented, and a loss of connection between each
mating pair of optical fibers can be reduced as much as possible.</p>
    <p num="0049">In the optical junction connector, the ferrule guide hole
is formed into the non-circular transverse cross-sectional
shape. Therefore, when the ferrule, having the non-circular
transverse cross-sectional shape corresponding to the
non-circular transverse cross-sectional shape of the ferrule
guide hole, is inserted into the ferrule guide hole, the ferrule
is prevented from turning about its axis within the ferrule
guide hole. Therefore, the misalignment of the axes of the
optical fibers (in the ferrule) relative to the axes of the 
optical fibers (which are held in the ferrule guide hole, and
are to be connected respectively to the above optical fibers)
due to the turning movement of the ferrule is prevented, and
a loss of connection between each mating pair of optical fibers
can be reduced as much as possible.</p>
