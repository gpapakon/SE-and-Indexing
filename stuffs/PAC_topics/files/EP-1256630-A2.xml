    <heading>Technical Field</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for
amplifying DNA of an organism. More particularly, the
present invention is directed to a process for amplifying
DNA of an organism through Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR)
without any information regarding to a primer needed for
amplifying DNA of an organism.</p>
    <heading>Background Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">The DNA contained in an organism and the mRNA
transcribed from DNA, are very complex and small in
amount. Therefore, amplification process is required for
DNA analysis of the DNA sequence except few cases. To
this end, two kind of techniques are used generally.</p>
    <p num="0003">The first method is that DNA is cloned in a
microorganism selectively or prepared to a library, and
then proliferating the microorganism in large scale, the
microorganisms contains desired DNA fragment are isolated.</p>
    <p num="0004">The second method is that desired DNA site is
amplified by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (hereinafter,
PCR). In second method, however, there is a problem that
the sequence of both ends of the desired DNA site should
be noted in advance. Therefore, in case the base sequence
of the DNA to be amplified has not yet be known, the
perfect amplification of full length DNA or cDNA of an
organism through PCR process without missing any part
thereof is impossible.</p>
    <p num="0005">Generally, in order to analyze the base
sequence of DNA in large scale, full length DNA of an
organism is divided into some short fragments to be
inserted into a vehicle for amplification, and then the
base sequence of the DNA fragments thus amplified, are 
determined.</p>
    <p num="0006">For this process, the ordered library is
generally used. However, the ordered library technique is
very difficult, complex, time-consuming and very laborious
process, thus this process is the largest obstacles for
analyzing the DNA sequence.</p>
    <p num="0007">Therefore, the object of the present invention
is to provide a method for amplifying DNA without any
information for the base sequence of the DNA to be
amplified in advance.</p>
    <heading>Disclosure of Invention</heading>
    <p num="0008">The object of the present invention may be
achieved by providing a process for digesting DNA into
several fragments by using restriction enzyme, ligating
the fragments with adaptor which has hairpin loop,
removing the DNA fragments and adaptors which are not
participated in ligation reaction by using exonuclease,
eliminating the hairpin loop by using alkaline solution,
RNase or single strand specific exonuclease, and
amplifying the DNA fragments by using primer which can
combine complementarily on the residual sequence from the
adapters.</p>
    <p num="0009">The process of the present invention comprises:
<sl><li>i)a step for digesting DNA into several fragments which
have single-strand cohesive ends by using restriction
enzyme, and separately from the above, for preparing
hairpin loop adaptors which have the single-strand
cohesive end which can be complementarily combined and
ligated on the both ends of the DNA fragment obtained in
the above;</li><li>ii) a step for ligating the DNA fragments with the hairpin
loop adapters prepared in step i) by using DNA ligase; </li><li>iii)a step for removing DNA fragments and hairpin loop
adapters which have not participated in the ligation
reaction by using exonuclease;</li><li>iv) optionally, a step for eliminating the hairpin loop by
using alkaline solution, RNase or single strand specific
exonuclease; and</li><li>v) a step for amplifying the DNA fragment by using DNA
polymerase and primer which can combine complementarily on
the residual sequence from the adapters</li></sl>
to obtain DNA in large amount through Polymerase Chain
Reaction from DNA of which sequence is completely unknown.</p>
    <p num="0010">In addition, another object of the present
invention may be achieved by providing a process for
making library of DNA fragment of which terminal sequence
are known by using DNA of which base sequence is
completely unknown, which comprises:
<sl><li>i)a step for digesting DNA into fragments which have
single-strand cohesive end by using restriction enzyme,
and separately from the above, for preparing a series of
hairpin loop adapters which have single-strand cohesive
end of which base sequence is known;</li><li>ii)a step for ligating the DNA fragments with the hairpin
loop adapters prepared in the above step i) by using DNA
ligase;</li><li>iii) a step for eliminating the hairpin loop only from the
DNA fragments which contain hairpin loop adapter, obtained
in step ii) by treating alkaline solution, RNase of single
strand specific exonuclease.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0011">Yet another object of the present invention is
to provide a series of hairpin loop adapters which have
single-strand cohesive end, which comprises hairpin loop
adapters of which single-strand cohesive ends composed of 
all sorts of single-strand DNA which can be made by random
combination of 4 nucleotides.</p>
    <p num="0012">Hereinafter, the process of the present
invention, the DNA fragments, hairpin loop adapters,
restriction enzyme and primers of the present invention
will be explained in more detail.</p>
    <p num="0013">The adapter which has hairpin loop structure,
illustrated in Fig.1, is distributed in the test tubes
which are arranged according to Fig. 3 by following
methods. For example, as illustrated in the Fig. 3, in
case CG is located in column 7 and AG is located in row 3,
adapters which contain CG in the terminal of cohesive end
(for column) and adapters contain AG in the terminal of
cohesive end (for row) are mixed.</p>
    <p num="0014">In case of the number of nucleotides which
constitute the single-strand cohesive end, is two, the
number of test tubes of the arrangement, are 112. In case
the number of nucleotides which constitute the cohesive
end is N, the number of kind of hairpin loop adapter, is
(4<sup>2n</sup>-2*4<sup>n</sup>)/2. The 5', 3' terminal of an adapters and those
of DNA fragments should be combined complementarily.</p>
    <p num="0015">After distributing the hairpin loop adapters
into each test tubes by the above mentioned way, DNA
fragments obtained by using restriction enzymes, are mixed
in the test tubes in appropriate amounts. Then, ligation
reaction is performed.</p>
    <p num="0016">After the ligation reaction, the DNA fragments
and hairpin loop adapters which were not participated in
ligation reaction are removed by adding exonuclease to
each test tube. Then, DNA fragments which have hairpin
loop in the ends, remain without any damage from the
exonuclease attack. </p>
    <p num="0017">The hairpin loop may be eliminated by treatment
of alkaline compound such as NaOH or by using RNase or
single strand specific exonuclease, to make normal DNA
double strand.</p>
    <p num="0018">PCR is performed with the primer which can
complementarily combine on the terminal sequence of DNA
obtained in the above, which originated from the adapter
and remains on the DNA after the elimination of hairpin
loop.</p>
    <p num="0019">PCR products thus obtained may be separated
through polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and DNA
obtained from each band of gel may be used for the further
analysis.</p>
    <p num="0020">The above process may be performed repeatedly
by using of another restriction enzymes. A full length
DNA of an organism may be analyzed by comparing the
nucleotide sequences obtained by using various restriction
enzymes. In case of mRNA, in principle, the
sequence of all kinds of mRNA of an organism, may be
determined through the process of the present invention.</p>
