  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to an absorption type
cooling and heating apparatus for operating in three
different modes: cooling operation, heat-pump heating
operation, and direct-burner or direct flame heating
operation, and particularly to an absorption type cooling
and heating apparatus arranged in which a cooling operation
and a heat-pump operation are carried out at optimum
conditions and can readily be switched to a direct-burner
heating operation.</p>
    <p num="0002">There has been increased the demand of an absorption
type cooling and heating apparatus which can carry out a
heat-pump heating operation with the use of heat pumped
up by an absorber in addition to a cooling operation. Such
a heat-pump heating may however be declined in the efficiency
of pumping up an energy of heat as the ambient temperature
drops down. For compensation, an improvement is disclosed
in Japanese Patent Publication (Heisei)6-97127 where if
the ambient temperature is too low, the heat-pump heating
operation is replaced with a direct-burner heating
operation.</p>
    <p num="0003">We, the applicants, have developed an absorption type 
cooling and heating apparatus which can easily switch
between a cooling operation, a heat-pump heating operation,
and a direct-burner heating operation as is disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication (Heisei)10-197008.
Our reference cooling and heating apparatus has a closed
circulation loop where, when heat-pump heating operation
fails to generate a required power of heating, a refrigerant
in vapor heated to a high temperature by a regenerator is
transferred to a condenser where it comes into contact with
a contact with a cooling water conduit and is thus condensed
before returned back to the regenerator. This allows the
refrigerant vapor extracted from the regenerator to be fully
condensed by the condenser but not circulated from the
condenser to an evaporator, thus shifting from the heat-pump
heating operation to the direct-burner heating operation.</p>
    <p num="0004">Also, we have developed another absorption type cooling
and heating apparatus which has a dedicated circulation
path for permitting the refrigerant to spontaneously drop
down from a condenser to a rectifier thus to circulate from
the condenser via the rectifier to a regenerator as disclosed
in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication
(Heisei)10-267448.</p>
    <p num="0005">The absorption type cooling and heating apparatus with
the dedicated circulation path however needs an extra
conduit of the dedicated circulation path for circulating
the refrigerant, hence increasing the number of joints. 
This is unfavorable for generating a degree of vacuum in
the system of the apparatus. The apparatus may be modified
with a bypass where the refrigerant over-flown from the
condenser is directly returned back to the top portion of
the rectifier. It is yet necessary for inhibiting overflow
in the other operation mode than the direct-burner heating
operation to save a more amount of the refrigerant in the
condenser. As a result, the duration of time from the
initiation of the direct-burner heating operation to the
start of overflow will be extended thus creating
substantially a time delay be fore starting the direct-burner
heating operation. As the refrigerant remaining in the
condenser stays out of the actual operation, the energy
spent for saving the refrigerant prior to the overflow will
be wasted.</p>
    <p num="0006">Also, the refrigerant remains at a considerable amount
in the condenser at the start-up and will not move into
the evaporator before a substantial difference in the
pressure is developed. Therefore, the solution circulated
from the absorber to the regenerator becomes highly dense
and its density may be too high in the regenerator. This
results in a less-vapor state in the regenerator. It is
hence needed for preparing an excess amount of the
refrigerant in the evaporator at the start-up to feed a
redundancy of the refrigerant into the evaporator. </p>
    <p num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide
an absorption type cooling and heating apparatus which
carries out a cooling operation or a heat-pump heating
operation at optimum conditions and when needed, readily
switch the operation mode into a direct-burner heating
operation while eliminating the foregoing drawbacks.</p>
    <p num="0008">Present invention having the first feature comprising
an evaporator for holding a refrigerant, an absorber for
allowing an absorbent solution to absorb a refrigerant vapor
generated in the evaporator, a regenerator for recovering
the density of an absorbent in the absorbent solution by
heating up to extract the refrigerant vapor from the
absorbent solution, a refrigerant vapor passage for
transferring the refrigerant vapor from the regenerator
to a condenser, and the condenser for condensing the
refrigerant vapor which is returned back to the evaporator,
where in a cooling operation, a heat-pump heating operation,
and a direct-burner heating operation can be performed
selectively, said absorption type cooling and heating
apparatus comprising, a first conduit for transferring the
condensed refrigerant generated in the condenser to the
evaporator, a second conduit for transferring the absorbent
solution from the absorber to the regenerator, a branch
conduit branched from the first conduit, and a switching
device for selectively communicating the branch conduit
to the second conduit. </p>
    <p num="0009">According to the first feature of the present invention,
the communication between the branch conduit and the second
conduit by the action of the switching device allows the
refrigerant to flow from the condenser via the branch conduit
and the second conduit to the regenerator. When the branch
conduit and the second conduit are disconnected from each,
the refrigerant is transferred via the first conduit to
the evaporator.</p>
    <p num="0010">Present invention having the second feature in which
the switching device is a first check valve for allowing
the flow from the condenser via the branch conduit to the
regenerator while a second check valve is also provided
for allowing the flow from the absorber to the regenerator,
the first and second check valve communicated with each
other at the downstream side.</p>
    <p num="0011">According to the second feature of the present invention,
at the start-up mode or the direct-burner heating operation
mode where the pressure is lower at the absorber side than
at the condenser side, the second check valve is closed
to inhibit the flow of the solution from the absorber to
the regenerator. On the other hand, at the heat-pump heating
operation mode where the pressure is higher at the absorber
side than at the condenser side, the first check valve is
closed to inhibit the flow of the refrigerant from the
condenser to the regenerator.</p>
    <p num="0012">Present invention having the third feature in which 
the first and second check valves are assembled in a single
unit having a movable valve portion provided at the
downstream junction thereof so that the valve portion can
be shifted to each end of its movement by a pressure difference
between two fluids introduced into the input ports of the
first and second check valves, thus the first check valve
is shut up when the valve portion shifted to one end of
its movement and the second check valve when the valve portion
shifted to the other end.</p>
    <p num="0013">According to the third feature of the present invention,
the first and second check valves are assembled together
with the single valve provided for common use, hence
contributing to the simplification of the overall
arrangement. Also, the first and second check valves are
selectively operated with the valve shifted for opening
by the action of a pressure difference between two fluid
inputs. As a result, no actuator will be needed for driving
the valve.</p>

    <p num="0015">A preferred embodiment of the present invention will
be described in more detail referring to the accompanying
drawings. Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a primary part
of an absorption cooling and heating apparatus of the
embodiment of the present invention. An evaporator 1
accommodates a refrigerant of fluoride alcohol, such as
trifluoroethanol (TFE), while an absorber 2 accommodates
a solution of DMI derivative, such as
dimethyl-imidazolidinon, which contains an absorbent. The
refrigerant is not limited to fluoride alcohol but may be
an appropriate agent of which the nonfreezing range is wide.
The solution is not limited either to the DMI derivative
and it may be any other absorbent solution which is wide
in the nonfreezing range, being higher than TFE in
atmospheric temperature boiling point and having an enough
power to absorb TFE.</p>
    <p num="0016">The evaporator 1 and the absorber 2 are fluidly
communicated to each other by a (refrigerant) vapor passage.
When the evaporator 1 is kept under a low pressure condition
of e.g. 30 mmHg, the refrigerant is vaporized therein and
moves via the passage into the absorber 2, as denoted by
the double-line arrows. The refrigerant vapor is then
absorbed by the absorbent in the absorber 2 thus causing
an absorption freezing action.</p>
    <p num="0017">Absorption refrigerating action is implemented by 
absorbing the vapor refrigerant with the solution in the
absorber 2. A cooler (heat exchanger) 18 is provided in
the vapor passage.</p>
    <p num="0018">When a burner 7 is lit to heat up a regenerator 3 for
increasing the concentration of the absorbent solution in
the absorber 2, the absorbent absorbs the refrigerant vapor
in the absorber 2 and the evaporation of the refrigerant
in the evaporator 1 is accelerated hence cooling down the
interior of the evaporator 1 with the latent heat of the
refrigerant evaporation. The burner, the regenerator, and
the concentration of the absorbent solution will be described
later in more detail. A tube or pipe 1a for passing a cooled
water is mounted to run through the evaporator 1 by using
a pump P4. The tube 1a is connected at one end (the exit
side in the embodiment shown) to the No.1 opening of a first
four-way valve V1 and at the other end (the entrance side
in the embodiment) to the No.1 opening of a second four-way
valve V2. The refrigerant is fed by the action of a pump
P1 to a spraying means 1b mounted in the evaporator 1 for
being sprayed over the tube 1a in which the cooled water
runs. The refrigerant deprives the cooled water in the tube
1a of heat and turns to a refrigerant vapor which passes
via the cooler 18 on the vapor passage into the absorber
2. Consequently, the temperature of the cooled water is
more declined.</p>
    <p num="0019">The refrigerant in the evaporator 1 is driven by the 
pump P1 to the spraying means and, its portion is passed
through the filter 4 and transferred to the substantial top
portion of the rectifier 6. A flow control valve V5 is
provided on a conduit 1c as a bleed line located between
the evaporator 1 and the filter 4. The cooled water running
in the tube 1a may preferably be either an ethylene glycol
or propylene glycol water solution.</p>
    <p num="0020">As the refrigerant vapor is absorbed by the solution
in the absorber 2, the absorption heat increases the
temperature of the solution. The lower the temperature and
the higher the concentration of the solution, the greater
the absorbing capability of the solution will be. For
attenuating the temperature increase of the solution, a tube
2a is provided in the absorber 2 for passing a flow of cooling
water. The tube 2a is connected at one end (the exit side
in the embodiment shown) via a condenser 9 and a pump P3
to the No.2 opening of the first four-way valve V1 and at
the other end (the entrance side) to the No.2 opening of
the second four-way valve V2. Preferably, the cooling water
running along the tube 2a is the same as the cooled water
which runs across the tube 1a in properties or constitution.</p>
    <p num="0021">The absorbent solution is fed by the action of the pump
P2 to a spraying means 2b mounted in the absorber 2 for being
sprayed over the tube 2a. Consequently, the solution is
cooled down by the cooling water running along the tube 2a.
Simultaneously, the cooling water deprives the solution of 
heat and its temperature will increase. As the solution
in the absorber 2 has absorbed the refrigerant vapor, the
concentration of the absorbent drops thus lowering the
absorbing capability of the solution.</p>
    <p num="0022">The diluted solution which has absorbed the refrigerant
vapor in the absorber 2 is passed via a tube 7b and a control
valve or second check valve V3 to the rectifier 6 and the
regenerator 3 by the pump P2. The regenerator 3 is provided
with the burner 7 for heating up the diluted solution. The
burner 7 may be a gas burner or any other heating means.
The solution is heated by the burner 7 and the concentration
of the absorbent is increased as the refrigerant vapor is
separated. The resultant (concentrated) solution is
returned via a tube 7a and a control valve V4 to the absorber
2 where it is sprayed over the tube 2a by the spraying means
2b and pump P2.</p>
    <p num="0023">The refrigerant vapor generated in the regenerator 3
transferred to the condenser after sufficient separation
of a small amount of mixed absorbent solution component from
the absorbent solution which is flow down in the rectifier
6 by sufficient contact of the vapor when the vapor flow
upward in the rectifier 6. The refrigerant which is cooled
and condensed in the condenser 9 is fed back to the evaporator
1 by passing through the conduit 9b via the cooler 18 and
depression valve (flow control valve) 11, then is sprayed
on the conduit 1a by spray means. The cooler 18 which is 
a heat exchanger composed on the vapor passage. The cooler
18 accelerate vaporization of the mixed refrigerant mist
in the refrigerant vapor generated in the evaporator 1 by
heat up the warm refrigerant which is fed back from the
condenser. Simultaneously, it depresses the temperature
of the refrigerant fed back to the evaporator 1.</p>
    <p num="0024">The conduit 9b by which the refrigerant is fed back
from the condenser 9 to the evaporator 1, is branched into
the conduit 9a which is j join with the conduit 7b at downstream
side of the check valve V3. The branch conduit 9a is provided
of a check valve (first check valve) 17 which allows the
refrigerant flow into the conduit 7b from the condenser 9.
The conduit 9a provides a portion of a circulation pass in
which the refrigerant is fed back to the regenerator 3 from
the condenser 9 during the direct burner heating operation.
An action of the check valve V3 and 17 in every operation
modes will be described later.</p>
    <p num="0025">Although the concentration of the refrigerant
circulated from the condenser 9 to the evaporator 1 is very
high, it may inevitably be declined with a small amount
of the absorbent accumulated therein through long operation
cycles in the evaporator 1. In order to increase the
concentration of the refrigerant received from the
evaporator 3, a portion of the refrigerant from the
evaporator 1 is transferred via the filter 4 to the rectifier
6 as described above. The filtering action of the filter 
4 inhibits any dirt or rust in the refrigerant from blocking
up the conduits in the rectifier 6 and decreasing their
function.</p>
    <p num="0026">In the heat exchanger 12 provided between the two
conduits 7a and 7b connecting to the absorber 2 and the
rectifier 6 respectively, the high-temperature strong
solution received from the conduit 7a of the regenerator
3 is subjected to a heat exchanging action with the weak
solution received from the conduit 7 of the absorber and
its resultant cooled down solution is transferred and
sprayed in the absorber 2. The weak solution heated up
preliminary in the heat exchanger 12 is transferred to the
rectifier 6. In this manner, the efficiency of heat
exchanging can be improved. Moreover, another heat
exchanger (not shown) may be provided for transmitting the
heat from the strong solution to the cooling water in the
conduit 2a connected from the absorber 2 or the condenser
9. As the temperature of the cooling water is increased,
the temperature of the strong solution flowed to the absorber
2 will drop down more.</p>
    <p num="0027">A sensible heat exchanger 14 for exchanging heat of
the cooled water or cooling water with the ambient air is
linked to a conduit 4a while a room unit 15 is lined to
a conduit 3a. The two conduits 3a and 4a (the inlets as
illustrated) are connected at one end to the ports #3 and
#4 of the first four-way valve V1 respectively and at the 
other end (the outlets as illustrated) to the ports #3 and
#4 of the second four-way valve V2 respectively. The room
unit 15 has a fan 10 and its blow outlet (not shown) provided
for common use to releasing blows of cooling air and warming
air and is located in a room to be cooled or heated. The
sensitive heat exchanger 14 is located at the outdoor for
forcibly exchanging heat with the ambient air using a fan
19. Also denoted by T1, T3, T9, T14, and T15 are temperature
sensors, by L1, L2, and L9 are liquid level sensors, and
by PS1 and PS9 are pressure sensors.</p>
    <p num="0028">For the heat-pump heating operation, the first four-way
valve V1 are controlled so as to connect the ports #1 and
#4 and, the second four-way valve V2 are controlled so as
to connect the ports #2 and #3. This allows the cooling
water heated in the absorber 2 and the condenser 9 and received
from the conduit 2a to be conveyed by the action of the
pump P3 to the conduit 3a in the room unit 15 for heating
the room.</p>
    <p num="0029">During the heat-pump heating operation, the heating
capability will be declined when the ambient temperature
is extremely low and its heat is hardly taken in. When the
ambient temperature is too low, the heat-pump heating
operation is switched to the direct-burner heating operation
where the refrigerant vapor generated in the regenerator
3 is transferred to and from the condenser 9. As the energy
of heat by the burner 7 is efficiently transferred by the 
action of the condenser 9 to the cooling water running in
the conduit 2a in the direct-burner heating operation, the
temperature of the cooling water is raised and the heating
capability can be increased.</p>
    <p num="0030">More specifically, when the ambient temperature is low
enough to decline the heating capability, both the conduit
9b of the refrigerant from the condenser 9 to the evaporator
1 and the conduit 7a of the strong solution from the
regenerator 3 to the absorber 2 are shut up to suspend the
heat-pump heating operation. As the heat-pump heating
operation has been suspended, the refrigerant condensed
in the condenser 9 is returned back to the regenerator 3
via the conduits 9b, 9a, and 7b by the action of check valves
17 and V3 which will be explained later in more detail.</p>
    <p num="0031">The switching from the heat-pump heating operation to
the direct-burner heating operation, i.e. the shut up of
the conduits 7a and 9b, may automatically be implemented
according to the temperature detected by the temperature
sensor T14 provided at an appropriate location at the outdoor
(for example, adjacent to the sensitive heat exchanger 14)
upon sensing that the ambient temperature drops down to
below a predetermined level. Lower ambient temperature
below the predetermined level may be determined from whether
the load in the heating becomes too high or not. The
calculation of the load in the heating operation and the
switching to the direct-burner heating operation are 
depicted in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publications
(Heisei) 6-318183 and 10-185344 by us, the applicants, which
are quoted as the references in this application.</p>
    <p num="0032">The action of the check valves V3 and 17 in each operation
mode will now be explained. Figs. 2A and 2B are cross
sectional views of a three-way valve implemented by a
combination of the two check valves V3 and 17. Fig. 2A
illustrates the heat-pump heating operation while Fig. 2B
illustrates the direct-burner heating operation or full
condensation and start-up of the operation. It is assumed
that, during the heat-pump heating operation shown in Fig.
2A, the pressure PS1 exerted at the condenser 9 side of
the check valve 17 is 350 Torr. Similarly, the pressure
PS2 exerted at the absorber 2 side of the check valve V3
is 450 Torr. As the pressure PS2 includes a partial pressure
derived from the heat exchanger 12, it is higher than the
pressure PS1. This opens the check valve V3 to deliver the
weak solution from the absorber 2 to the regenerator 3.
Simultaneously, the check valve 17 is closed to cancel the
transfer of the refrigerant from the condenser 9 to the
regenerator 3.</p>
    <p num="0033">On the other hand, during the direct-burner heating
operation at the full condensation mode or the start-up
mode shown in Fig. 2B, the pressure PS2 at the upstream
of the check valve V3 is about 20 Torr as is much smaller
than the pressure PS1 (about 350 Torr) at the condenser 
9 side of the check valve 17. The pressure PS2 is
substantially close to the saturated pressure at either
the absorber 2 or the evaporator 1. As a result, the check
valve V3 is closed to inhibit the flow of the weak solution
from the absorber 2 to the regenerator 3. Simultaneously,
the check valve 17 is opened to permit the flow of the
refrigerant from the condenser 9 to the regenerator 3.</p>
    <p num="0034">At the start-up operation, the refrigerant from the
condenser 9 is delivered via the conduits 9a and 7b to the
regenerator 3. When the operation state is transferred to
a stable operation state, the conduit 9a is closed to transfer
the refrigerant from the condenser 9 to the evaporator 1.
Then, when the heat-pump heating operation is transferred
to the direct-burner heating operation, the refrigerant
is delivered from the condenser 9 via the conduits 9a and
7b to the regenerator 3. More particularly, with no use
of any switching actuator, the circulation passes for the
refrigerant and the absorbent solution can successfully
be developed to implement each of the operation modes as
the branch conduit 9a has automatically been switched by
the effect of a difference in the pressure between the
condenser 9 side and the absorber 2 side.</p>
    <p num="0035">The switching between the conduits for the refrigerant
is not limited to the action of the integrally provided
check valves V3 and 17 having valves as the moving parts
shown in Figs. 2A and 2B. Figs. 3A and 3B are cross sectional 
view of a modifications having a single moving part or valve
provided for switching between the conduits. Fig. 3A
illustrates the heat-pump heating operation while Fig. 3B
illustrates the direct-burner heating operation which runs
at the full condensation mode or the start-up mode. A valve
assembly 21 has a free ball 22 provided therein as the valve
(the moving part) for free movement in the valve assembly
21. When the ball 22 is shifted to the left as shown in
Fig. 3A, it shuts up the port 21a connected to the condenser
9 and simultaneously opens the port 21b connected to the
absorber 2. When the ball 22 is shifted to the right as
shown in Fig. 3B, it shuts up the port 21b connected to
the absorber 2 and opens the port 21a connected to the
condenser 9.</p>
    <p num="0036">As described with Figs. 3A and 3B, the pressure PS2
at the absorber 2 side is higher than the pressure PS1 at
the condenser 9 side in the heat-pump heating operation
thus shifting the ball 22 to shut up the port 21a. This
movement allows the weak solution to flow from the absorber
2 into the regenerator 3 and inhibits the refrigerant from
receiving via the branch conduit 9a from the condenser 9.
When the direct-burner heating operation or the start-up
operation is initiated, the pressure PS2 at the absorber
2 side becomes lower than the pressure PS1 at the condenser
9 side thus shifting the ball 22 to shut up the port 21b.
This inhibits the weak solution from receiving from the 
absorber 2 and allows the refrigerant to flow from the
condenser 9 via the branch conduit 9a into the regenerator
3.</p>
    <p num="0037">As defined in claims 1 to 3, the second check valve
is closed to inhibit the flow of the solution from the absorber
to the regenerator when the start-up operation or the
directly-burner heating operation is initiated, i.e. the
pressure is lower at the absorber side than at the condenser
side. When the heat-pump heating operation is initiated,
i.e. the pressure is higher at the absorber side than at
the condenser side, the first check valve is closed to inhibit
the flow of the refrigerant from the condenser to the
regenerator.</p>
    <p num="0038">Particularly, as defined in claim 3, the valve is shifted
by the action of a pressure difference in the system thus
to switch the flow from one conduit to another. Accordingly,
the overall arrangement can be simplified with the use of
no valve actuator.</p>
    <p num="0039">Also, as the refrigerant is conveyed from the condenser
to the regenerator by the action of the switching means
but not over-flown from the condenser, the following
advantage is gained. Since the solution to be processed
is greater in the amount than the rectifying step in the
direct-burner heating operation, its over-flow will
increase. If the size of the rectifier is determined in
view of the over-flow, it may hardly conform to the 
requirement of the rectifying action. The present
invention allows the rectifier to be sized in view of only
optimization of its rectifying function.</p>
    <p num="0040">As the refrigerator needs not to stay in the condenser
until it over-flows, its overall amount in the system can
be minimized and the condenser can be downsized. It is also
unnecessary to support the energy until the over-flow
starts.</p>
