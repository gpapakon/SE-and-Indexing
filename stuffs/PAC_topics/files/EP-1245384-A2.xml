      <u style="single">Background of the Invention</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a control
apparatus for an image exposure apparatus which exposes
an image on a printing plate, an image exposure
apparatus, and a control apparatus which controls a
multicolor printing press.</p>
    <heading>[Plate Making on Press]</heading>
    <p num="0002">In recent years, in order to improve the
efficiency of plate making operation or to improve the
registration accuracy, a plate making apparatus is
attached to a printing press itself whereby plate making
operation is directly performed on the printing press by
the plate making apparatus. That is, instead of using a
plate making apparatus separated from a printing press,
a printing plate (raw plate) mounted on a plate cylinder
is irradiated with a laser beam from the head of a plate
making apparatus attached to a printing unit, thereby
exposing an image. This operation is called plate
making on press.</p>
    <p num="0003">More specifically, the rotation speed of the
printing press is increased to a designated value. When
the rotational speed has stabilized, laser irradiation 
(exposure) from the head to the printing plate is
started. After that, the head is moved in the axial
direction of the plate cylinder while continuing
exposure, thereby exposing an image on the entire plate
mounted on the plate cylinder. The exposure time is
determined by the plate size and the designated
rotational speed at the time of exposure. Techniques
for exposing an image on a printing plate by laser
irradiation are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,379,698
(reference 1) and the like, and a detailed description
thereof will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="0004">Fig. 4 shows the attached state of plate
making apparatuses to a four-color rotary printing
press. Referring to Fig. 4, plate making apparatuses
102-1 to 102-4 are attached to printing units 101-1 to
101-4 of the respective colors. The plate making
apparatuses 102-1 to 102-4 are normally at positions
indicated by the alternate long and two dashed lines in
Fig. 4. When exposure operation is to be performed,
they are moved close to plate cylinders 103-1 to 103-4
in the printing units 101-1 to 101-4. Reference
numerals 104-1 to 104-4 denote blanket cylinders on
which blankets are mounted. Impression cylinders (not
shown) are arranged under the blanket cylinders 104-1 to
104-4.</p>
    <p num="0005">Fig. 5 shows main part of a plate making
apparatus 102. The plate making apparatus 102 has an 
exposure unit 102b having a head 102a. The exposure
unit 102b is fixed on a table 102c. The table 102c
moves in the axial direction (indicated by a
double-headed arrow A-B) of a plate cylinder 103 while
being guided along rails 102f1 and 102f2 on a base 102f
by a ball screw 102e rotated by a motor 102d. A
printing plate (raw plate) 105 is mounted on the surface
of the plate cylinder 103.</p>
    <p num="0006">In plate making on press, the exposure range
of an image onto the printing plate 105 is set before
the start of actual image exposure by causing an
operator to input the X-coordinate distance (X1,0) from
the origin (0,0) at the left edge on the leading edge
side of the printing plate 105 to the left edge of the
image range and the Y-coordinate distance (0,Y1) to the
leading edge of the image range, as shown in Fig. 6.
That is, let W be the image size in the X-axis
direction, and H be the image size in the Y-axis
direction. The origin (0,0) is defined at the left edge
on the leading edge side of the printing plate 105. The
image range is defined by X-coordinates "X1" and "X1 +
W" and Y-coordinates "Y1" and "Y1 + H".</p>
    <p num="0007">Assume that the number of pixels of the image
is n in the X-axis direction and m in the Y-axis
direction, as shown in Fig. 7. A distance ŒîX between
the pixels in the X-axis direction is given by ŒîX =
W/n, and a distance ŒîY between the pixels in the Y-axis 
direction is given by ŒîY = H/m. The plate making
apparatus 102 defines ŒîX and ŒîY as the exposure
intervals in the X- and Y-axis directions and exposes
image data that is input in advance within that image
range.</p>
    <p num="0008">More specifically, the head 102a of the plate
making apparatus 102 is moved from the left to the right
while rotating the plate cylinder 103 at a predetermined
rotational speed. The head 102a is stopped at the
position X1, and the pixels of one line in the Y
direction are exposed at the interval ŒîY. That is,
pixels within the range from (X1,Y1) to (X1,Y1+H) are
exposed. Next, the head 102a is moved to the right by
ŒîX. At the next position, the pixels of the next line
in the Y direction are exposed at the interval ŒîY.
This operation is repeated until the X-coordinate "X1 +
W".</p>
    <p num="0009">The image data (image "1"/non-image "0") of
each pixel is not stored in correspondence with the data
of its exposure position. Only data of image
"1"/non-image "0" are sequentially stored. In actual
exposure, the image data are sequentially read out, and
the pixels are sequentially exposed from the position
(X1,Y1) at the interval ŒîY in the Y direction and at
the interval ŒîX in the X direction. This is because
the number of image data to be processed is enormous.
If the image data are collated with position data and 
exposed one by one, a very long time and large storage
capacity are impractically required.</p>
    <p num="0010">In printing by a rotary printing press, a high
pressure must be applied to printing paper between the
blanket cylinder and the impression cylinder. For this
reason, the printing paper stretches toward the trailing
edge side. Hence, the image printed by the preceding
printing unit expands into a wide trapezoidal shape
toward the trailing edge side, resulting in
misregistration between colors. This tendency is
especially conspicuous in offset printing because
printing is executed with water supplied.</p>
    <p num="0011">Fig. 8 shows an image state on printing paper
after printing of the second color. A printing paper
sheet 106 stretches due to printing by the second-color
printing unit, and a first-color image 107 expands into
a trapezoidal shape. For this reason, shifts are
generated between the first-color image 107 and a
second-color image 108. That is, shifts w1 and w2 in
the horizontal direction (a direction perpendicular to
the sheet convey direction) of the printing paper sheet
106, a shift h in the vertical direction (sheet convey
direction), and shifts (distortion amounts) s1 and s2
due to distortions are generated. Similarly, the
first- and second-color images further expand into
trapezoidal shapes due to printing by the third-color
printing unit. The first-, second-, and third-color 
images further expand into trapezoidal shapes due to
printing by the fourth-color printing unit. In this
way, shifts are generated between the color images,
resulting in a defective printing product.</p>
    <p num="0012">To solve this problem, the present applicant
proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-309084
(U.S. Patent No. 6,283,467; reference 2) a sheet-like
object convey apparatus which stretches the trailing
edge side of a printing paper sheet in the horizontal
direction (right-to-left direction) upon transferring
the printing paper sheet to a printing section whereby
the shape of the printing paper sheet is deformed in
advance into a trapezoidal shape whose width increases
toward the trailing edge side to eliminate or reduce
stretching of the printing paper sheet during printing,
thereby eliminating or reducing the shift of the image
due to distortion by the stretch of the printing paper
sheet during printing. The correction operation of the
sheet-like object convey apparatus disclosed in
reference 2 will be described with reference to Figs. 10
and 11.</p>
    <p num="0013">Referring to Fig. 10, when a swing 1 pivots
from a point b to a point <u style="single">a</u>, i.e., the gripping position
of a feeding cylinder 4 along with rotation of a feeding
cylinder shaft 4a, the edge portion of a paper sheet 6
is gripped by a plurality of gripper units (not shown)
each formed from a gripper and gripper pad. 
Simultaneously, the central portion of a support shaft
(not shown) that supports the gripper units is pressed
and deflected by Œ±, as indicated by the alternate long
and two dashed line in Fig. 11. When the support shaft
deflects, the gripper units at the central portion
retreat from those on both sides by Œ±. In this state,
when the feeding cylinder shaft 4a rotates to move the
swing 1 from the point <u style="single">a</u> to the point b, press against
the support shaft is canceled. All the gripper units
are aligned on one line, as indicated by the solid line
in Fig. 11.</p>
    <p num="0014">When the gripper units at the central portion
move, the directions of gripper units are changed toward
the left and right end sides of the paper sheet 6 from
the central portion relatively to those in gripping the
paper sheet. The paper sheet 6 is stretched to become
wide toward the trailing edge side. With this
operation, the paper sheet 6 is deformed in advance into
a trapezoidal shape whose width increases toward the
trailing edge side before printing. Since stretching
of the printing paper sheet during printing is
eliminated or reduced, the shift of the image due to
distortion by the stretch of the printing paper sheet
during printing is eliminated or reduced. Hence,
fan-out registration is corrected. Reference numeral 5
denotes a lower swing; 6a, a feedboard; and 7, an
impression cylinder. </p>
    <p num="0015">According to the sheet-like object convey
apparatus described in reference 2, of the shifts of the
image, the shifts s1 and s2 due to distortions are
corrected, as shown in Fig. 9. However, since the
shifts w1 and w2 in the horizontal direction and the
shift h in the vertical direction cannot be corrected,
defective printing products cannot be completely
avoided.</p>

    </heading>
    <p num="0019">The present invention will be described below
in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="0020">First, the principle of the present invention
will be described. Referring to Fig. 9, to align a
second-color image 108 with a first-color image 107, the
X-coordinate at which image exposure to the second-color
printing plate starts is moved by -w1 to set an X-axis
direction pixel interval ŒîX given by
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center">ŒîX = (W + w1 + w2)/n</st32:df>
In addition, a Y-axis direction pixel interval ŒîY is
set to
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center">ŒîY = (H + h)/m</st32:df></p>
    <p num="0021">That is, w1, w2, and h are measured in
advance. The start position of image exposure to the
second-color printing plate is adjusted from (X1,Y1) to
(X1-w1,Y1). The pixel interval ŒîX in the X-axis
direction is adjusted from W/n to (W + w1 + w2)/n. The
pixel interval ŒîY in the Y-axis direction is adjusted
from H/m to (H + h)/m. Then, the second-color image 108
matches the first-color image 107.</p>
    <p num="0022">In the present invention, for example, to
expose an image to the second-color printing plate, w1,
w2, and h are read out as correction amounts set in
accordance with the stretch amount of the printing paper
sheet. Next, on the basis of the readout correction
amounts, the image exposure start position is adjusted 
from (X1,Y1) to (X1-w1,Y1). In addition, the pixel
interval ŒîX in the X-axis direction is adjusted from
W/n to (W + w1 + w2)/n. The pixel interval ŒîY in the
Y-axis direction is adjusted from H/m to (H + h)/m.</p>
    <p num="0023">Fig. 1 shows a control apparatus for an image
exposure apparatus according to an embodiment of the
present invention. Referring to Fig. 1, reference
numeral 110 denotes an image position correction control
apparatus; 111, a paper convey apparatus; 112-1, an
image exposure apparatus for the first-color printing
plate; 112-2, an image exposure apparatus for the
second-color printing plate; 112-3, an image exposure
apparatus for the third-color printing plate; 112-4, an
image exposure apparatus for the fourth-color printing
plate; and 113, an image data generation apparatus. The
paper convey apparatus 111, image exposure apparatuses
112-1 to 112-4, and image data generation apparatus 113
are connected to the image position correction control
apparatus 110.</p>
    <p num="0024">The image position correction control
apparatus 110 comprises a CPU (Central Processing Unit)
110a, a ROM (Read Only Memory) 110b, a RAM (Random
Access Memory) 110c, an input device 110d constructed by

connected to the bus BUS1 through an I/O interface (I/F) 
110p. The paper convey apparatus 111 and image exposure
apparatuses 112-1 to 112-4 are connected to the bus BUS1
through an I/O interface (I/F) 110q. The image data
generation apparatus 113 supplies to the image position

    <p num="0027">The paper convey apparatus 111 has a paper
convey mechanism 111p having the same structure as that
of the sheet-like object convey apparatus disclosed in
reference 2. The paper convey apparatus 111 deflects
the gripper shaft in the paper convey direction in
gripping, with swing grippers, the end portion of a
sheet-like object that is supplied from the convey
direction at the time of conveying a paper sheet in
accordance with rotation of a motor (to be described
later), thereby correcting the shape of the sheet-like
object. When a printing paper sheet is transferred to a
first-color printing unit 101-1 (Fig. 4) of the printing
section, the paper convey mechanism 111p stretches the
rear end portion of the printing paper sheet in the
horizontal direction (a direction perpendicular to the
paper convey direction) to deform in advance the paper
into a trapezoidal shape whose width increases toward
the leading edge side. As a result, the image after
printing has an almost rectangular shape. For the 
arrangement of the paper convey mechanism 111p, the
arrangement of the sheet-like object convey apparatus
described in reference 2 is incorporated in this
specification.</p>

    <heading>[Generation of Database]</heading>
    <p num="0032">At the beginning of operation, a database for
various kinds of correction amounts (reference
correction amounts and unique correction amounts for
each type of printing paper sheet) is generated. This
database is generated in the following way.</p>
    <heading>[Generation of Reference Correction Amounts]</heading>
    <p num="0033">The operator turns on the reference correction
amount storage mode switch 110d1 of the input device
110d at the start of database generation. When the
reference correction amount storage mode switch 110d1 is
turned on, the CPU 110a sets all data in the memory 110j
to 0. The memory 110j stores reference correction 
amounts w1Fi, w2Fi, and hFi (i = 1 to 4) of the exposure
positions of images of the respective colors and a
reference correction amount s1F of the paper convey
apparatus, as will be described later. All the
reference correction amounts are reset to 0.</p>
    <p num="0034">Next, the CPU 110a reads out image sizes "W"
and "H" which are stored in the memory 110i together
with image data. The CPU 110a calculates data (X1,Y1)
of the accurate image position (exposure start position)
and sets them in the memory 110h such that the W √ó H
image matches the X-direction central position of the
printing plate and the printing start position on the
leading edge side.</p>
    <p num="0035">The operator turns on the exposure start
switch 110d2 of the input device 110d. When the
exposure start switch 110d2 is turned on, the CPU 110a
reads out, from the memory 110j, the reference
correction amounts w1Fi, w2Fi, and hFi of the exposure
position of images of the respective colors and the
reference correction amount s1F of the paper convey
apparatus. In this case, all the reference correction
amounts w1Fi, w2Fi, hFi, and s1F of each color are 0.</p>
    <p num="0036">The CPU 110a obtains the X-coordinate
(X1 - w1Fi) of the left edge of the image to be exposed
to the printing plate of each color on the basis of the
readout reference correction amounts w1Fi, w2Fi, and
hFi. The CPU 110a also obtains the pixel interval ŒîX 
in the X-axis direction of the image of each color as Œî
X = (W + w1Fi + w2Fi)/n and the pixel interval ŒîY in
the Y-axis direction as ŒîY = (H + hFi)/m. In this
case, since the reference correction amounts w1Fi, w2Fi,
and hFi of each color are 0, the X-coordinate of the
left edge of the image to be exposed to the printing
plate of each color is X1. The pixel interval ŒîX in
the X-axis direction of the image of each color is
obtained as ŒîX = W/n. The pixel interval ŒîY in the
Y-axis direction is obtained as ŒîY = H/m.</p>
    <p num="0037">The CPU 110a stores, in the memory 1101, the

direction of the image of each color, and the pixel
interval ŒîY = H/m in the Y-axis direction of the image
of each color. The CPU 110a also sets identical data in
the memory 112g of the image exposure apparatus 112 of
each color. Next, the CPU 110a sets the data (X1,Y1) of
the image position, which is stored in the memory 110h,
in the memory 112f of the image exposure apparatus 112
of each color. The CPU 110a also sets the reference
correction amount s1F (in this case, s1F = 0) read out
from the memory 110j in the memory 111g of the paper
convey apparatus 111.</p>
    <p num="0038">In the image exposure apparatus 112 of each
color, the CPU 112a reads out the image position data

of a corresponding color, and the pixel interval ŒîY =
H/m in the Y-axis direction of the image of a
corresponding color, which are set in the memory 112g.
On the basis of the readout data, the exposure start
position is set at (X1,Y1). The image is exposed to the
printing plate (raw plate) of each color at the interval
ŒîX = W/n in the X-axis direction and at the interval Œî

110j of the image position correction control apparatus
110.</p>
    <p num="0040">Next, shift amounts w1F2 and w2F2 in the

in the distortion direction is done using the image

correction in the horizontal and vertical directions
needs to be executed in exposing the image data of each
pixel to the printing plate. For this reason, only the
reference correction amounts w1Fi, w2Fi, hFi, and s1F
and unique correction amounts w1i, w2i, hi, s1i, and s2i 
corresponding to the type of printing paper sheet need
to be stored. Hence, a small storage capacity suffices.
In addition, since only the X-coordinate of the left
edge of the image to be exposed to the printing plate
and the X-axis direction pixel interval and Y-axis
direction pixel interval of the image need to be
corrected, processing can easily be done in a short
time.</p>
    <p num="0065">This applies not only to a case wherein the
paper convey apparatus is automatically controlled using
the motor for the paper convey apparatus, as described
in the above embodiment, but also to a case wherein the
operator manually operates the paper convey apparatus.</p>
    <p num="0066">In this embodiment, the reference correction
amounts w1Fi, w2Fi, and hFi (i = 1 to 4) of the exposure
positions of images of all the four colors are stored in
the memory 110j. In addition, the unique correction
amounts w1i, w2i, and hi (i = 1 to 4) of the exposure
positions of images of all the four colors are stored in
the memory 110k in correspondence with the type of
printing paper sheet. However, the correction amounts
w1F w2F1, and hF1 of the first-color image or the
unique correction amounts w11, w21, and h1 of the
first-color image corresponding to the type of printing
paper sheet need not always be stored. That is, the
reference correction amounts and unique correction
amounts of the first-color image are always 0. Hence, 
when the image is to be exposed to the first-color
printing plate, (X1,Y1) is used as the exposure start
position, ŒîX = W/n is used as the pixel interval in the
X-axis direction, and ŒîY = H/m is used as the pixel
interval in the Y-axis direction.</p>
    <p num="0067">In this embodiment, plate making is executed
on the printing press as plate making on press.
However, the present invention can also be applied to a
case wherein an image is exposed to a printing plate by
a dedicated plate making machine separated from a
printing press, and then, printing is executed by
attaching the printing plate with the exposed image to
the printing press.</p>
    <p num="0068">In this embodiment, correction amounts are
supplied from the image position correction control
apparatus 110 to the paper convey apparatus 111.
However, correction amounts to the paper convey
apparatus 111 may be manually set as input values from
the operator.</p>
    <p num="0069">As has been described above, according to the
present invention, in exposing an image to a printing
plate, correction amounts set in accordance with the
stretch amount of a printing paper sheet are read out,
and the exposure position of each pixel of the image is
adjusted on the basis of the correction amounts. With
this arrangement, when the exposure start position
(X1,Y1) of the image on the printing plate, the pixel 
interval ŒîX in the X-axis direction, and the pixel
interval ŒîY in the Y-axis direction are adjusted, any
misregistration between the colors due to stretch of the
printing paper sheet can be eliminated, and any
defective printing product can be prevented.</p>
