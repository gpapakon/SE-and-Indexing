    <heading>
      <u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <heading>1. Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a token
type content providing system, a token type content
providing system and a potable user terminal for
easily using content related to information which a
user is interested in via a network when content
related to information transferred to the user by
various mediums is provided via the network</p>
    <heading>2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">Regardless of indoor or outdoor, various
information is originated from various information
notification mediums such as television/radio
broadcast, bulletin boards, advertisement, magazine,
show window and the like. Thus, the user has
various opportunities for viewing various
information from the various information
notification mediums in various circumstances in
daily life. In addition, the Internet has been
remarkably developed recently and the WWW system
which provides various digital content has been
widespread. Thus, an enormous amount of contents
can be used via the WWW. In addition, when the WWW
provides digital content including detailed
information which relates to information which the
user directly views or hears from the various
information notification medium such as
television/radio broadcast, bulletin boards,
advertisement, magazine, show window and the like,
the user can refer to and use the content via the
network.</p>
    <p num="0003">When the WWW provides digital content 
related to information conveyed by the various
information notification mediums such as broadcast,
bulletin boards, advertisement, magazine, show
window and the like, and when the user becomes
interested in the content and wants to use it, the
user thinks of a keyword and the like for specifying
desired content among information appeared in the
advertisement and magazine and the like and the user
can searches for the content by using the keyword by
using a server service for searching content on the
WWW such as www.goo.ne.jp and the like. As a result,
the user can access the content.</p>
    <p num="0004">In addition, by including a resource
location "URL" of WWW content related to information
notified by the various information notification
mediums, the user can refer to and use the content
directly by using the URL.</p>
    <p num="0005">However, operation load for the user is
large and convenience is bad when the user predicts
a keyword from the information conveyed by the
various information notification mediums such as
broadcast, bulletin boards, advertisement, magazine,
show window and the like and searches for the
content by using the keyword. Thus, a method for
accessing related content on the WWW more
efficiently is required.</p>
    <p num="0006">As for a method in which the information
notification medium transmits the URL itself, the
user needs to memorize the viewed URL. However, in
a circumstance where an enormous amount of
advertising information is viewed or heard in the
outside, it is very difficult that the user
memorizes every URL since the amount of information
which the user is interested in is very large. Thus,
it is necessary to record the URLs by using some
means. In addition, the user needs to input the
recorded URLs by using a WWW browser. </p>
    <p num="0007">In the case where only the URLs are
recorded by using some means, when the user uses the
content by using the URLs, it is difficult for the
user to determine content which a URL provides. To
determine content corresponding to a URL, the user
needs to record information describing the URL in
addition to the URL. As mentioned above, when a
method is adopted in which the URL and the
accompanied information are conveyed, load for the
user is large when the user accesses the related
content on the WWW.</p>
    <p num="0008">Further, as for the URL, since the
corresponding content is decided uniquely, there is
a problem in that the URL only provides the same
information to users even when the user have
different points on which the users are interested
in the information conveyed by the information
notification medium.</p>
    <p num="0009">In addition, it is desirable for the user
to provide means for automatically marking
information in which the user is interested
according to a predetermined condition.</p>
    <p num="0010">Printed matter such as a paper, a magazine
and a street advertisement is included in the
various information notification mediums which
transmit information. However, since the space of
the printed matter is limited and the amount of
information which can be printed is limited, there
is a case in which only main information can be
described. The document of the WWW which has been
widespread recently solves the above-mentioned
problem of the printed document by introducing hyper
text/hyper media in which a text or an image in the
document is associated with other documents. In the
hyper text, as for information which can not be
described in the document for reasons of document
layout, a hyper link corresponding to the 
information is provided in the document, so that the
user can access, as necessary, the information which
is not described in the document via the hyperlink.</p>
    <p num="0011">In order to apply the merit of the
hypertext not only to the document on the WWW but
also to the conventional printed document, an
technology is developed for embedding the hyperlink
in the printed document. In T.Wakita et al.,
"attempt to merging WWW and paper media by using two
dimensional code", IPSJ Human Interface 98-HI-76,
Vol.98, pp.1-6, January, 1988, a method is
disclosed to handle the printed document like the
Web page by configuring the printed document by
embedding QR (Quick Response) code which is a Kind
of two dimensional barcode in the position of the
link.</p>
    <p num="0012">In Toshifumi Arai, at.el., "Paperlink: A
technique for hyperlink from real paper to
electronic content" , In Proceedings of the ACM
Conference o Human Factors in Computing Systems
(CHI'97), pp. 327-334, Addison-Wesley, 1997, a
method is disclosed for handling the printed
document as a hypertext by defining action in the
paper document by using VideoPen which is formed by
combining a pen type small camera and a highlighter.</p>
    <p num="0013">These technologies have been incorporated
as an actual service. For example, in Internet
barcode of Digit Inc. and Cue of Digital:Convergence
Co. Inc., one can access a Web page by reading a
barcode on the paper by using a special-purpose
barcode reader and connecting to the Internet.</p>
    <p num="0014">According to these services, labor for
inputting a URL in the WWW browser on the PC can be
saved when referring to information related to the
printed information on the paper. However, since
the medium is changed to the printed paper to the PC,
it is difficult to use this system when the two 
mediums can be used. Especially, when trying to
access information related to an advertisement in a
train or a poster in the outside in which it is
difficult to use the PC, the related information can
not be referred to speedily. In recent years, the
computer has been downsized and development of
Wearable Computer is going on.</p>
    <p num="0015">In addition, mobile communication
infrastructure has become widespread, so that the
environment is ripe for connecting the Internet
irrespective of whether one is in the inside or in
the outside. Against this backdrop, an information
using system has been developed in which information
on the network is allocated to a body of the real
world such as a printed matter and the information
is presented. In Jun Rekimoto and Katashi Nagao,
"The world through computer" , Proceedings of the
ACN Symposium on User Interface Software and
Technology(uist'95), pp. 29-36, ACM Press, November
1995, a system is disclosed in which two dimensional
barcode is attached to a body of the real world, and
related information is provided in real-time by
using the barcode.</p>
    <p num="0016">By using the technology for configuring
the small computer terminal, it is considered that a
system for providing information of hypertext or
hypermedia related to information printed, described
or presented on a paper or other mediums which is
transferred to the user can be realized as a service
system which is more practical and usable.</p>
    <p num="0017">However, there are some problems in the
conventional system in the aspect of practicality.
For example, various headlines of articles are
arranged in a strap advertisement of a weekly
magazine. If the approach using the barcode is
adopted for realizing a system in which a user
accesses information related to an article selected 
from among the articles, it is necessary to embed
barcode for each headline, so that there is a
problem that appearance quality of the advertisement
is lost. Instead, when an approach of providing one
barcode in the corner of the advertisement is
adopted, the barcode should identify a plurality of
items of information, so that it is necessary to
decide an order by which a plurality of items of
information are presented to the user. However,
there is no conventional system which can perform
this process.</p>
    <p num="0018">In addition, there is a problem in that
information unnecessary for the user is provided,
and it is necessary to improve this problem.</p>
    <p num="0019">By using the information providing system,
a business attaching an advertisement to related
information which is provided can be considered.
For example, assuming that a picture of a fine play
in a yesterday's baseball game is appeared in a
sports section in a newspaper, and that a link is
established for the picture and one can access
images of scenes of the fine play by following the
link, a business can be considered in which the
image is provided to a user at no charge by
inserting a CM in the last image of the scene and
advertisement rates are obtained from the sponsor of
the inserted CM. However, there is no conventional
system for inserting attached advertisement content.</p>
    <p num="0020">In addition, there is no means for
providing image and sound, especially image and
sound in a live, and other information in
association with the printed matter. Therefore, for
example, it is impossible to obtain image and sound
indicating current state of a point and weather
information at the point by selecting the point on a
road map printed on a paper.</p>
    <p num="0021">In addition, there is no mechanism for 
playing back the obtained image and sound from a
desired position. Generally, a video image of a
baseball game is stored as a video image from the
start of the game to the end of the game. Thus, it
is necessary to specify an address of the video
content and a playback start position to view a
scene of a fine play.</p>
    <p num="0022">In addition, according to the conventional
systems, it is impossible that printed matter is
provided after translation, content is played back
after converted to voice, and when an article is a
quiz, the user answers it, obtains the answer and a
program relating to the article is provided, or, by
selecting an article, a server in the network
performs a necessary setting.</p>
    <p num="0023">In addition, a mechanism is not provided
in which a predetermined setting is performed in the
network side by selecting the printed article. The
mechanism is, for example, for setting for recording
reservation in the network side by selecting TV
information in the outside.</p>
    <p num="0024">In addition, there is more important
problem in connections between the printed matter
and the medium used for accessing the related
information such as PC and the like according to the
conventional system. It is necessary to improve
this problem and realize a method for presenting
information closely related to information on the
printed matter. In addition, the user terminal
should be compact and lightweight, and portable.</p>

    <p num="0073">According to the token type content
providing system for achieving the third object, it
becomes possible to present obtained content by
using a method specified by the presentation control
information included in the content information. In
addition, in a case where a plurality of items of
information are identified by a token, by including
presentation order of contents, keywords indicating
contents in the presentation control information,
how the plurality of items of information are
presented to the user can be determined. In
addition, contents to be presented can be selected
on the basis of desired genre setting by the user in
the portable user terminal.</p>

    <heading>[basic operation example in the first embodiment]</heading>
    <p num="0102">Next, basic operation example of the token
type content providing system 1 having the above
configuration will be described. In the following,
it will be described with reference to Fig.1.</p>
    <p num="0103">In the following description of the basic
operation example, the network 2 is the Internet and
the content server 3 is a WWW server.</p>
    <p num="0104">First, a content provider providing
content by the content server 3 via WWW sends
content information corresponding to the content and
information of the information notification medium 7
which transmits information related to the content
to the content information registration server 6,
registers the content information in the content
information database 4 and obtains a token
corresponding to the content.</p>
    <p num="0105">When the token is information on
surrounding state of the portable user terminal such
as time information, position information of the
portable user terminal, orientation information of
the terminal, moving direction information of the
terminal and the like, the content provider is not
necessarily obtains the token at the time of
registering the content information. In this case,
the content provider receives, instead of the token,
information indicating that registration of the
content information is completed.</p>
    <p num="0106">When the content information registration
server 6 receives the content information and
information of the information notification medium
which transmits information related to the content
from the content provider, the content information
registration server 6 assigns a content identifier
to the content information, and registers them in
the content information database, and associates the
content identifier with a token, and adds the
content identifier to the token table. </p>
    <p num="0107">After that, when the content provider
obtains information related to the content and
corresponding token from the information
notification medium 7, the content provider
originates the token.</p>
    <p num="0108">The portable user terminal 8 sends user
content information which is a plurality of items of
content information and user information which are
stored in a storing means to the user management
server 10 one after another at the time when the
portable user terminal 8 is used or after the
portable user terminal 8 is used. The user
management server 10 manages user content
information and user information for each user
identifier.</p>
    <p num="0109">In addition, the portable user terminal 8
obtains a user identifier from the user when
starting. This function can be realized, for
example, by a method in which login screen is
displayed on starting so that the user logs in.
After obtaining the user identifier, the portable
user terminal 8 sends the user identifier to the
user management server 10, obtains user content
information and user information corresponding to
the user identification, stores these information in
a storing means, displays icon information included
in each content information in the user content
information , and presents existence of each content
information in the storing means to the user.</p>
    <p num="0110">In addition, the portable user terminal 8
obtains a token at a timing when an instruction is
generated by the user who views or hears originating
information of the various information notification
medium such as television/radio broadcast,
advertising, magazine, show window and the like,
that is, at the timing when the marking operation
occurs. Then, the portable user terminal 8 sends 
the token to the linkup server 9 via the network.
The linkup server 9 determines one or more content
identifier by referring to the token table database
5, obtains content information corresponding to one
or more content identifiers, and sends the content
information to the portable user terminal 8.</p>
    <p num="0111">The portable user terminal 8 has a storing
means for storing received content information. The
content information includes pictorial information
indicating content description and icon information
on a picture. The portable user terminal 8 includes
a user interface function displaying the icon
information included in the content information
stored in the storing means. The portable user
terminal 8 displays the icon information included in
the content information so that it presents
existence of each content information in the storing
means when the content information is received from
the linkup server 9 according to the above-mentioned
processes.</p>
    <p num="0112">In addition, the portable user terminal 8
includes a user interface function used for the user
to select icon information which is displayed. When
the icon information is selected by the user, the
portable user terminal 8 displays content obtained
by using the resource location included in the
received contests information including the icon
information received.</p>
    <p num="0113">In addition, the portable user terminal 8
includes a user interface function used by the user
for deleting the displayed icon information. When
the icon information is deleted by the user, the
received content information including the icon
information is deleted from the storing meas.</p>
    <heading>[an example for providing content information
applicable to the portable user terminal]</heading>
    <p num="0114">In the above-mentioned example, an 
embodiment has been described in which content

    <p num="0115">In this case, the portable user terminal 8
includes a storing means for managing user
information on the user and terminal information on
the portable user terminal, and the content
information includes attribute information on the
content. When sending an obtained token to the
linkup server 9, the portable user terminal 8 sends
the token, user terminal and the terminal
information to the linkup server 9 via the network 2.</p>
    <p num="0116">The linkup server 9 determines one or more
content identifier corresponding to the received
token by referring to the token table database 5,
obtains content information corresponding to the one
or more content identifier from the content
information database 4, and selects one or more
items of content information by referring to the
user information, terminal information and the
attribute information of the content information,
and sends the selected content information to the
portable user terminal 8.</p>
    <p num="0117">The portable user terminal 8 obtains
content from the content server 3 by using the
resource location included in the received content
information.</p>
    <p num="0118">A concrete example in the above
configuration will be described in the following.</p>
    <p num="0119">The user information is information on the
user including one or more of items of information
which are name, sex, age, occupation, address, ZIP
code, family structure, information on residence 
(condominium, stand-alone house and the like), hobby,
information genre which the user interested in

    <p num="0120">The terminal information is information
including resolution of the display device of the
portable user terminal 8, the number of colors which
can be displayed, performance of WWW information
browsing means (availability of Java function,
existence of video and voice content play back
function, coding format information which can be
played back as the video sound content) and the like.</p>
    <p num="0121">The portable user terminal 8 includes a
memory part for storing the user information and the
terminal information, and an input part for
providing a function for inputting user information
to the user. The user inputs various user
information via the input part, and the input user
information is held in the memory part. In addition,
the terminal information is held in the memory part
when the terminal is manufactured, or, the terminal
information is sent to the memory part from the
display playback part and held when the display part
is connected.</p>
    <p num="0122">In addition, as described before, the
content information held in the content information
database 4 includes URL which is the resource
location and the attribute information. The
attribute information in this example is
characteristics of a user to which the content
information can be provided, that is, sex, age, body 
shape characteristic, ability characteristic,
occupation, district, Zip code group, family
structure characteristic, residence characteristic,
annual income, information genre to which the
content information belongs, service use right
necessary for using the content information,
terminal characteristics of the terminal to which
the service is provided, that is, resolution
characteristics of display apparatus, the number of
colors which can be displayed, and performance of
WWW information browsing part.</p>
    <p num="0123">Examples of the content information
including the resource location (URL) and the
attribute information are as follows. The content
information may include icon information in addition
to the above-mentioned information, however, it is
not included in the following example.</p>
    <p num="0124">Content information example 1: "URL1 (for
woman), (target age is equal to or more than 20 ),
(equal to or more than 1024×800), (equal to or more
than256 colors)"

   Content information example 2: "URL2
(clothing size M), (Java function is necessary)"

   Content information example 3: "URL3,
(occupation: housewife), (Tokyo)"

   Content information example 4: "URL4, (for
woman), (eyesight equal to of below 0.8)"

   Content information example 5: "URL5,
(genre sports).</p>
    <p num="0125">For example, the content for the content
information example 1 are advertising information of
tobacco for woman, and are not for applicable for
one under 20 or a man. The content information
example 2 corresponds to advertising information of
closing, the content information example 3
corresponds to commodity information in a
supermarket in Tokyo, the content information 
example 4 corresponds to advertising information for
eyeglass for a woman. In addition, the content
information example 5 corresponds to advertisement
for sports goods and the like.</p>
    <p num="0126">The linkup server 9 specifies the content
identifier from the token according to the before
mentioned procedure, and specifies the corresponding
content information. After that, the linkup server
9 refers to attribute information included in the
corresponding content information, the user
information and the terminal information, selects
the content information according to them, and sends
the content information to the portable user
terminal 8.</p>
    <p num="0127">For example, in the case that content
information associated with the content identifier
specified from the token received by the linkup
server 9 from the portable user terminal 8 is the
content information examples 1-5, when the user
information is (female) and the terminal information
is (resolution 800×600), (Java is not available),
the content information providing part excludes the
content information example 1 and the content
information example 2 in which the condition for the
content information example 1 is that resolution
needs to be equal to more than 1024×800 and the
condition for the content information example 2 is
that Java is available. Then, the content
information providing part sends the remaining URL3,
URL4, URL5 to the portable user terminal.</p>
    <p num="0128">When the user information is (female),
(Kyoto), (eyesight 1.5), (interested genre : book),
and the terminal information is (resolution 1024×
800), (Java is available), the content information
providing part excludes the content information
example 3 of which the subject area is Tokyo, the
content information example 4 which requires that 
eyesight of the user is equal to or less than 0.8,
and the content information example 5 in which a
genre is specified but the genre is other than book.
Then, the content information providing part sends
the remaining URL1 and URL2 to the portable user
terminal 8.</p>
    <p num="0129">Other than the above-mentioned example,
when (only A service member can use) is provided to
the content information as attribute information and
the user information includes the A service member
number, the content information is sent to the
portable user terminal. In addition, when
information of (driver's license is necessary) is
provided to the content information and the user
information includes (have driver's license), the
content information is sent to the portable user
terminal.</p>
    <p num="0130">In addition, there is a case in that, when
information of (mpeg2 format) is added to the
content information as the attribute information and
the terminal information includes (reproducible
coding method :mpeg2), the content information is
sent to the portable user terminal.</p>
    <p num="0131">In the above-mentioned examples, by using
the user information and the terminal information,
content information which can not be used by a
portable user terminal used by the user is not sent,
and only information necessary for the user or
usable for the user can be sent.</p>
    <p num="0132">A case in which content information
different for each user and the portable user
terminal is provided according to the user
information or the terminal information of the
portable user terminal was described.</p>
    <heading>[example of obtaining token automatically]</heading>
    <p num="0133">Next, an example in which the portable
user terminal 8 automatically obtain the token in 
the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="0134">In this case, the portable user terminal 8
includes an automatic marking part for obtaining a
token at a timing based on a condition set
beforehand. The portable user terminal 8 obtains
the token automatically by an instruction of the
automatic marking part. Operations after that are
the same as the above-mentioned embodiment.</p>
    <p num="0135">In the following, more concrete
embodiments of the token type content providing
system 1 described so far will be described as
examples 1-1 - 1-6.</p>
    <heading>[Example 1-1]</heading>
    <p num="0136">First, an example 1-1 will be described
with reference to Fig.3. In the following
description and figures, operations and functions of
parts which are not described in detail are the same
as those of the token type content providing system
described so far.</p>
    <p num="0137">In this example, the information
notification medium 7 can be an street advertisement
placed in an arbitrary position, a strap
advertisement, a sign advertisement, a sign, an
electrical bulletin board, a liquid crystal bulletin
board, an outdoor display for advertisement, show
window, and a display table and the like.</p>
    <p num="0138">The token in this embodiment is
information including one or more items of time
information, position information of the portable
user terminal 8, orientation information of the
terminal, moving direction information of the
terminal at the time when the portable user terminal
8 obtains the token. The portable user terminal 8
has means for obtaining time information, position
information of the portable user terminal 8,
orientation information of the terminal, moving
direction information of the terminal. </p>
    <p num="0139">The token table database 5 manages
information indicating relationship between
information including one or more of time
information at the time when the portable user
terminal 8 obtains the token, position information
of the portable user terminal 8, orientation
information of the terminal, moving direction
information of the terminal, and the content
identifier.</p>
    <p num="0140">More concretely, the portable user
terminal 8 includes one or more of a watch 81, a
position detection device 82 such as a GPS and the
like, an acceleration sensor device 83 which
extracts moving direction and the like. The token
table database 5 has a function corresponding to a
map information database. More precisely, the token
table database 5 stores positions of the information
notification mediums (an street advertisement placed
in an arbitrary position, a strap advertisement, a
sign advertisement, a sign, an electrical bulletin
board, a liquid crystal bulletin board, an outdoor
display for advertisement, show window, and a
display table and the like) placed in various places,
area range to which information can be reached, and
content identifiers of content information on
content related to information transmitted by each
information notification medium at each time.</p>
    <p num="0141">Fig.4 shows an example of the token table
of this example. The token table shown in the
figure includes position information (latitude,
longitude, height) of the information notification
medium 7, information origination direction
(direction of sign) and time information. These
items of information are used for identifying a
content identifier of content which becomes a
subject of marking of the user and within the visual
field of the user from the token received from the 
portable user terminal 8, that is, terminal position
information, direction information, and time
information.</p>
    <p num="0142">The part indicated by asterisks in the
time information in the figure means that the parts
include all values. For example, when the time
information is indicated by **/**/** **:**:**, it
means that the information notification medium
transmits information every time. In addition, when
the time information is 01/03/23**:**:**,
information is transmitted every time on March 23,
2001.</p>
    <p num="0143">In the following, the operation of the
system of this example will be described with
reference to Fig.3.</p>
    <p num="0144">(STEP1) When the user is interested in
information transmitted by an information
notification medium such as a signboard
advertisement which comes in sight at a place and at
a time, the user performs marking operation of the
portable user terminal 8, for example, pushes a
marking button.</p>
    <p num="0145">(STEP2) The portable user terminal 8 obtains
one or more items of information of current time,
current position, terminal direction and terminal
moving direction as a token at the time when the
user performs the marking operation. Then, the
portable user terminal 8 stores the token with the
user information and the terminal information.</p>
    <p num="0146">(STEP3) When storing the token, the portable
user terminal instantly presents information (which
will be called mark information hereinafter)
indicating that the token is stored. Or, the
portable user terminal 8 notifies the user that a
process accompanied by the marking operation by the
user was performed by presenting the user mark
information on the token. Presentation of the mark 
information is to present a character string such as
"Mark", or a predetermined figure such as a stamp
mark and the time when the marking operation is
performed and the token is obtained.
(STEP4) The portable user terminal accesses the
linkup sever 9 via the network, and sends the token
formed by one or more items of information of
current time, current position, terminal direction
and terminal moving direction and the user
information and the terminal information to the
linkup server 9.</p>
    <p num="0147">(STEPS) The linkup server 9 specifies the
content identifier by referring to the token which
was obtained from the portable user terminal and the
token table database 5. Next, the linkup server 9
extracts every content information of content
related to information transmitted to the user by
referring to the content information database 4.
After selecting content information by using the
user information, terminal information, and the
attribute information of the content information,
the linkup server 9 sends the selected content
information to the portable user terminal.</p>
    <p num="0148">An example of a procedure for specifying
the content identifier of the content on the
information transmitted to the user is shown below.</p>
    <p num="0149">When a token including time, position
information and terminal moving direction is
obtained, the token table database 5 extracts
information notification mediums placed at positions
included in a semicircle area of terminal moving
direction side in which the position corresponding
to the position information is the center of the
semicircle and the radius is a predetermined value.
In addition, among the extracted information
notification mediums, the token table database 5
extracts information notification mediums in which 
there is no obstacle between the information
notification medium and the portable user terminal,
and which transmits information to a range including
the position of the portable user terminal. Then,
it is estimated that the information originated by
the selected information notification medium is
transmitted to the user.</p>
    <p num="0150">The above-mentioned procedure is an
example for predicting the information transmitted
to the user. Thus, other procedures such as a
simplified procedure of this example can be used.</p>
    <p num="0151">(STEP6) Next, the portable user terminal 8
stores one or more items of content information
received from the linkup server 9, and updates the
mark information to icon information included in
corresponding content information.</p>
    <p num="0152">(STEP7) Then, when the user selects icon
information, the potable user terminal performs a
process for obtaining and utilizing content on the
basis of a resource location of the corresponding
content information.</p>
    <p num="0153">In the above example, the portable user
terminal can be configured such that it
automatically obtains the token at a timing
determined by the portable user terminal 8 on the
basis of information determined by the user
beforehand or operation history information of the
user. In the following, this case will be described
with reference to Fig.5.</p>
    <p num="0154">In this case, the portable user terminal 8
further includes a camera device 84, and a character
recognition part 85 for analyzing an image received
from the camera device 84 and extracting character
string information in the image.</p>
    <p num="0155">In addition, a keyword database 86
including one or more keywords for identifying
desired information is registered beforehand by the 
user in the portable user terminal 8. The keywords
are newly registered manually by the user, or,
selected from the keywords database 86 provided in
the portable user terminal 8. In addition, there is
a case where the portable user terminal 8 refers to
the keywords register by the user and registers
keywords having similar meaning automatically.</p>
    <p num="0156">The keywords set beforehand are, for
example, specific genre names (car, music, movie,
travel, restaurant and the like) interested by the
user.</p>
    <p num="0157">The operation in the configuration shown
in Fig.5 is as follows.</p>
    <p num="0158">(STEP1) The portable user terminal 8 analyzes
image information input by the camera device 84
successively and extracts character string
information included in the image by using the
character recognition part 85. Then, when the
extracted character string information includes the
keyword in the keyword database 86, the portable
user terminal automatically performed the marking
process and obtains the token. Operations after
(STEP2) are the same as those of the above-mentioned
example.</p>
    <p num="0159">In addition, an example for obtaining the
token automatically by using voice information will
be described in the following.</p>
    <p num="0160">In this example, the portable user
terminal 8 includes a microphone device and a voice
recognition part for recognizing the voice input
from the microphone device and extracting character
string information.</p>
    <p num="0161">In addition, the portable user terminal 8
registers a keyword database including one or more

    <heading>(Second embodiment)</heading>
    <p num="0234">Next, an example in which the token type
content providing system described in the first
embodiment is applied to a coupon service will be
described as the second embodiment.</p>
    <p num="0235">Before describing the second embodiment, a
conventional technologies and the problems on the
coupon service will be described first.</p>
    <p num="0236">In a conventional coupon service, a coupon
is provided to the user by distributing as a leaflet
inserted in a newspaper or distributing on the
street. Then, the user can receive a special
service such as discount and the like by taking the
coupon to a store.</p>
    <p num="0237">As the Internet becomes widespread, and a
high performance portable phone (for example, i-mode 
of NTT DoCoMo) which is connected to the Internet
and can receive data such as image and the like
becomes widespread, the coupon service has become
diversified.</p>
    <p num="0238">In addition, there is a coupon service in
which a PC terminal which can use the Internet
accesses a predetermined home page, displays coupon
information on a screen, prints out it on a paper,
and the user use the paper as a coupon.</p>
    <p num="0239">In addition, there is a coupon service in
which an e-mail including coupon information is sent
to a mobile phone which has an e-mail function, and
the user presents the received e-mail in a store, so
that a coupon service is provided. In addition, a
coupon service using a mobile phone having a
function of browsing a home page, is provided in
which coupon information is sent by e-mail when
performing coupon request operation on an accessed
home page, and the user uses it as a coupon. In
addition, there is a coupon service in which the
coupon information sent by e-mail is a barcode image,
and the coupon service is provided by authenticating
the barcode image in a store.</p>
    <p num="0240">However, in the above-mentioned
conventional technology, sending the coupon
information mail to the users randomly is a problem
because the mail is sent to users who does not want
to use the service and pulling power is weak.
However, the method of accessing the predetermined
home page and printing it out and using it is
inconvenient since the user needs to access the hope
page. The inconvenience is the same as the method
of sending coupon information mail request and using
the received mail.</p>
    <p num="0241">In the second embodiment, to solve the
above-mentioned problems, a system to which the
token type content providing system described in the 
first embodiment is applied will be described.
According to this system, the token can be used as
the coupon. In addition, in the second embodiment,
a mechanism that the coupon provided as a token is
correctly used as a corresponding coupon service is
provided. In addition, a mechanism for grasping
that the coupon is used for the corresponding coupon
service. In addition, a mechanism for exchanging
coupon information provided as a coupon between
users like a normal paper coupon is provided.</p>

according to the judgment. In addition, the service
terminal 700 sends a coupon information use
notification to the coupon authentication server 500 
when it provides the coupon service.</p>
    <p num="0261">As another example of the token type
coupon providing system, a system in Japanese patent
application 2001-115997 "method, system and
apparatus for obtaining information related to
broadcast information" can be used. More
specifically, the related information content
providing server (which corresponds to the linkup
server of the present invention) is configured such

the related information content providing server or
related information includes the coupon information.
A viewer apparatus (which corresponds to the
portable user terminal of the present invention)
receives the service information including the
coupon information or the related information, and
the user uses a coupon service by using the coupon
information.</p>
    <p num="0262">In this case, when the coupon information
is used, the viewer terminal (corresponding to the
portable user terminal 8) sends coupon information
included in the received content information to the
service terminal 700. The service terminal 700
sends the coupon information to the coupon
authentication server 500, and the coupon
authentication server 500 authenticates the coupon
information and sends the result of authentication
to the service terminal 700. The service terminal
700 judges whether the coupon service can be
provided based on the result of authentication, and
provides the coupon service according to the

sends a coupon information use notification to the
coupon authentication server 500 when it provides
the coupon service.</p>
    <p num="0263">The function of the linkup server can be
constructed as a program, and the program can be 
installed in a computer used as the linkup server,
or can be distributed via the network.</p>
    <p num="0264">In addition, the program can be stored in
a hard disk connected to the computer used as the
linkup server, or a transportable recording medium
such as a floppy disk and a CD-ROM and the like. By
installing the program from the medium to the
computer, the present invention can be easily
realized.</p>
    <p num="0265">As mentioned above, according to the
present invention, an environment in which the user
can easily use a coupon service related to
information transmitted by the information
notification medium can be realized.</p>
    <p num="0266">According to the present invention, since
the linkup server is provided on the network, the
basic function of the system which can use the token
as the coupon can be realized.</p>
    <p num="0267">In addition, since the token type coupon
providing system of the present invention is formed
such that parts for providing coupon service is
added to the token type content providing system of
the first embodiment, the coupon providing service
and the content providing service provided by the
token type content providing system can be provided
simultaneously. That is, the coupon information and
information of content explaining details of the
coupon service can be provided simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="0268">In addition, in the token type coupon
providing system, the portable user terminal sends
coupon information to the service terminal. The
service terminal sends the coupon information to the
coupon authentication server, and the coupon
authentication server authenticates the coupon
information and sends the result of authentication
to the service terminal. The service terminal 700
judges whether the coupon service can be provided 
based on the result of authentication. Accordingly,
it is ensured that the provided coupon information
corresponding the token is applied to a target
coupon service.</p>
    <p num="0269">In addition, in the token type coupon
providing system, since the service terminal
includes a part which sends a coupon information use
notification to the coupon authentication server
when it provides the coupon service, the system can
grasp that the coupon was used.</p>
    <p num="0270">In addition, in order to exchange the
coupon information provided as the token between
users like a coupon of a paper, the portable user
terminal includes a function of sending received
coupon information to another portable user terminal
connected to the token type coupon providing system,
and a function of receiving coupon information from
another portable user terminal.</p>
    <p num="0271">Generally, a coupon of a paper is
distributed, or the user takes the coupon which is
placed in a store as necessary, and the user uses
the coupon. On the other hand, according to the
system of the present invention, the user can use
the coupon service by performing marking operation
(an operation for obtaining a coupon) by using the
portable user terminal when the user views or hears
information on the coupons service from the
information notification medium. By using this
system, the provider of the coupon service can
easily distribute a coupon via various information
notification mediums. In addition, the system
(coupon provider) can grasp using state of the
coupon. In addition, like the paper coupon, the
coupon can be exchanged between the users.</p>
