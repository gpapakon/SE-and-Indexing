key attributes considered by consumers. It is highly desirable that the tissue
product have a consumer perceived feel of softness. This softness plays a
key role in consumer preference. Softness relates both to the product bulk
and surface characteristics. In addition to softness, the consumer desires a
product that is both strong and absorbent to minimize the amount of the
product which must be used to do an effective job.</p>
    <p num="0004">In a conventional wet press ("CWP") process and apparatus 10, as
exemplified in Figure 1, a furnish is fed from a silo 50 through conduits 40, 41
to headbox chambers 20, 20'. A web (W) is formed on a conventional wire 
former 12, supported by rolls 18, 19 from a liquid slurry of pulp, water and
other chemicals. Materials removed from the web of fabric in the forming
zone when pressed against a forming roll 15 are returned to the silo 50 from a
saveall 22 through a conduit 24. The web is then transferred to a moving felt
or fabric 14, supported by a roll 11 for drying and pressing. Materials
removed from the web during drying and pressing or from a Uhle box 29 are
collected in a saveall 44 and fed to a white water conduit 45. The web is then
pressed by a suction press roll 16 against the surface of a rotating Yankee
dryer cylinder 26 which is heated to cause the paper to substantially dry on
the cylinder surface. The moisture within the web as it is laid on the Yankee
surface causes the web to transfer to the surface. Liquid adhesive may be
applied to the surface of the dryer to provide substantial adherence of the web
to the creping surface. The web is then creped from the surface with a
creping blade 27. The creped web is then usually passed between calender
rollers 30 and rolled up on a roll 28 prior to further converting operations, for
example, embossing. The action of the creping blade on the paper is known
to cause a portion of the interfiber bonds within the paper to be broken up by
the mechanical smashing action of the blade against the web as it is being
driven into the blade. However, fairly strong interfiber bonds are formed
between the wood pulp fibers during the drying of the moisture from the web.
The strength of these bonds in prior art tissues is such that, even after
creping, the web typically retains a perceived feeling of hardness, a fairly high
density, and low-bulk and water absorbency.</p>
    <p num="0005">To reduce the strength of the interfiber bonds that inevitably result
when wet pressing and drying a web from a slurry, various processes have 
been utilized. One such process is the passing of heated air through the wet
fibrous web after it is formed on a wire and transferred to a permeable
carrier -- a so-called through-air-drying ("TAD") process - so that the web is
not compacted prior to being dried. The lack of compaction, such as would
occur when the web is pressed while on a felt or fabric and against the drying
cylinder when it is transferred thereto, reduces the opportunity for interfiber
bonding to occur, and allows the finished product to have greater bulk than
can be achieved in a wet press process. Because of the consumer perceived
softness of these products, and their greater ability to absorb liquids than
webs formed in wet press processes, the products formed by the newer TAD
processes enjoy an advantage in consumer acceptance.</p>
    <p num="0006">Felted wet press processes, however, are significantly more energy
efficient than processes such as through-air-drying since they do not require
heating and moving large quantities of air as required by the TAD process. In
wet press operations, excess moisture is mechanically pressed from the web
and the final drying of the web is obtained chiefly on the heated Yankee
drying cylinder which is maintained at the proper drying temperature.</p>
    <p num="0007">A conventional TAD process is illustrated in Figure 2. In the process, a
wet sheet 71 that has been formed on a forming fabric 61 is transferred to a
through-air-drying fabric 62, usually by a vacuum device 63. TAD fabric 62 is
usually a coarsely woven fabric that allows relatively free passage of air
through both the fabric 62 and nascent web 71. While on the fabric 62, the
sheet 71 is dried by blowing hot air through the sheet 71 using a through-air-dryer
64. This operation reduces the sheet moisture to a value usually
between 10 and 65 percent. The partially dried sheet 71 is then transferred to 
a Yankee dryer 30 where it is dried to its final desired moisture content and is
subsequently creped off the Yankee.</p>
    <p num="0008">In a conventional embossing process according to the prior art as
shown in Figure 3, cellulosic webs 11 and 12 are supplied from parent rolls 21
and 22. The webs are joined together at or prior to the emboss nip which is
formed by an emboss roll 31 and a backing roll 41. The emboss roll 31 has
raised protrusions (not shown) on the surface of the roll that make up the
emboss pattern. This pattern is transferred to the combined webs by pressing
them between the emboss roll 31 and the backing roll 41, which is usually
made of rubber or other like material that allows the pattern on the emboss
roll 31 to be impressed into the combined web 13. The combined web 13
may be further processed by perfing and/or calendering (not shown) before it
is wound onto a finished roll 51.</p>
    <p num="0009">Thus, the art lacks a method for making a CWP tissue product that
achieves high strength, bulk, absorbency, and softness above existing
conventional wet pressed tissue, approaching or achieving levels even
beyond those found using through-air-drying. The art further lacks a method
for making a TAD product that achieves high strength, bulk, absorbency, and
softness above existing TAD tissue.</p>
    <p num="0010">These and other drawbacks of the prior art are overcome by the
method of the present invention which can use wet press technology to
prepare a strong, ultra soft, bulky tissue. The tissue produced by the method
of the present invention exhibits good strength and absorbency while
remaining extremely soft. Properties such as those exhibited by the CWP
tissue of the present invention have not heretofore been seen in wet press 
tissue products. The present invention provides a method for making a CWP
tissue product that achieves high strength, bulk, absorbency, and softness
above existing conventional wet pressed tissue, approaching or achieving
levels even beyond those found using through-air-drying. The process
according to the present invention is capable of using the cheaper more
efficient wet press process and optionally can use less expensive, non-premium
fibers. The method of the present invention can also be used to
prepare multi-ply tissue products from TAD basesheets. The present
invention can be used to make a TAD product that achieves high strength,
bulk, absorbency, and softness above existing TAD tissue.</p>

      <u style="single">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0017">The present invention relates to the production of an ultra-soft, bulky,
embossed, multi-ply tissue typically having a basis weight of about 18 or more
Ibs. per 3000 sq. ft. (ream). As used herein, ultra-soft products are those
having low values of tensile stiffness, friction deviation, or (usually) both.
Ultra-soft products generally have tensile stiffness of values of about 1.5
gram/inch/% strain per pound of basis weight or less, preferably about 1.0
gram/inch/% strain per pound of basis weight or less. The friction deviation of
ultra-soft products is usually no more than about 0.6, preferably about 0.55 or
less. As used in the specification and claims, the terms "friction" and "friction
deviation" should be considered synonymous unless indicated to the contrary.</p>
    <p num="0018">The present invention described herein in the context of CWP
technology is illustrative only and it is understood that such examples are not
meant to limit the invention. Furthermore, various changes and modifications
that may become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed
description are to be considered within the purview of the spirit and scope of
the invention.</p>
    <p num="0019">In particular what is especially intriguing about one embodiment of the
present technology is that it enables the manufacture of a premium quality
softness tissue with high bulk and high resiliency from a furnish which is of far
less than premium quality. High coarseness furnishes can be used, such as
those having a coarseness in excess of about 11 grams per hundred meters,
or recycled furnishes containing high proportions of fines, ash, or even
nonchemical pulps. Accordingly, the ability to utilize a low grade of the
starting furnish is considered to be an important aspect of this embodiment of
the present invention. </p>
    <p num="0020">In one embodiment of the present invention, an embossing process is
used in achieving novel results, wherein the following aspects are especially
important: (i) the embossing pattern chosen produces protuberances
predominantly on the harsher side of the sheet, preferably almost exclusively
or exclusively on the harsher side of the sheet (usually the air side of the
sheet, unless creping is performed with a biaxially undulatory type blade --
then the Yankee side is typically the harsher side); and (ii) the pattern exhibits
coverage of less than about 30%, preferably, less than about 20%, and more
preferably between about 2% to about 15%. The term "coverage" is defined
as being the percentage of the total area of the sheet which is deflected from
the base planar of the sheet by more than 0.002". In the most preferred
embodiments, the pattern will be a micro/macro pattern having such coverage
on the sheet. When the embossed plies are combined to form the multi-ply
product, the protuberances should be disposed to the interior of the finished
multi-ply product. Creping can also be performed with a biaxially undulatory
type blade on the unembossed sheet. In such case, the side of the sheet
having the resultant undulations or ridges (the Yankee side) is disposed in the
interior of the finished multi-ply product.</p>
    <p num="0021">The present invention in one embodiment provides a novel multi-ply
tissue having desired high caliper by heavily embossing one sheet without
necessarily obtaining a large difference in the sidedness of the multi-ply
tissue.</p>
    <p num="0022">In certain applications, the addition of at least about 1 Ib. per 3000
square foot ream of a cationic nitrogenous debonder in each ply of the multi-ply
product, is preferred. In certain applications, a temporary wet strength 
agent in an amount sufficient to bring the wet/dry ratio to at least about 10 to
about 15 percent, is preferably added. The resulting finished product
preferably has a machine direction tensile strength of from about 21 to about
35 grams/3 in. width per pound of basis weight and a caliper of at least about
2 mils/8 plies/pound basis weight.</p>
    <p num="0023">Until now, ultra-soft products have been made primarily from low-coarseness
hardwoods and softwoods. Low-coarseness hardwoods include
those fibers having a coarseness value (as measured by the OP Test Fiber
Quality Analyzer) of about 10 mg/100 meters or less. Examples of low-coarseness
hardwoods include Northern hardwood fibers, such as those
obtained from maple and aspen, and various species of Eucalyptus. Low-coarseness
softwoods have coarseness values in the 15 to 20 mg/100 m
range and include Northern softwoods such as fir and spruce. An ultra-soft
tissue product made from such fibers will have an overall coarseness value of
about 11 mg/100 m or less. These fibers produce tissues having excellent
formation and softness properties; however, they tend to be more costly than
their Southern and Western counterparts. However, typical CWP products
made exclusively from these low-coarseness fibers may be perceived by
users as being thin.</p>
    <p num="0024">Papermaking fibers used to form the soft absorbent, products of the
present invention include cellulosic fibers commonly referred to as wood pulp
fibers, liberated in the pulping process from softwood (gymnosperms or
coniferous trees) and hardwoods (angiosperms or deciduous trees).
Cellulosic fibers from diverse material origins may be used to form the web of
the present invention, including non-woody fibers liberated from sugar cane, 
bagasse, sabai grass, rice straw, banana leaves, paper mulberry (i.e, bast
fiber), abaca leaves, pineapple leaves, esparto grass leaves, and fibers from
the genus Hesperaloe in the family Agavaceae. Also recycled fibers which
may contain any of the above fibers sources in different percentages can be
used in the present invention. Suitable fibers are disclosed in U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,320,710 and 3,620,911, each of which is incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="0025">Papermaking fibers can be liberated from their source material by any
one of the number of chemical pulping processes familiar to one experienced
in the art including sulfate, sulfite, polysulfite, soda pulping, etc. The pulp can
be bleached if desired by chemical means including the use of chlorine,
chlorine dioxide, oxygen, etc. Furthermore, papermaking fibers can be
liberated from source material by any one of a number of
mechanical/chemical pulping processes familiar to anyone experienced in the
art including mechanical pulping, thermomechanical pulping, and chemi-thermomechanical
pulping. These mechanical pulps can be bleached, if one
wishes, by a number of familiar bleaching schemes including alkaline
peroxide and ozone bleaching. The type of furnish suitable for use in the
present invention is less critical than is the case for prior art products. A
significant advantage of our process over the prior art processes is that
coarse hardwoods and softwoods and significant amounts of recycled fiber
can be utilized to create a soft product in our process in addition to optional
premium furnish, while prior art products are required to utilize more
expensive low-coarseness softwoods and low-coarseness hardwoods, such
as eucalyptus to achieve such quality. </p>
    <p num="0026">Fiber length and coarseness can be measured using the model LDA96
Fiber Quality Analyzer, available from OpTest Equipment Inc. of Hawkesbury,
Ontario, Canada. These parameters can be determined using the procedure
outlined in the instrument's operating manual. In general, determination of
these values involves first accurately weighing a pulp sample (10-20 mg for
hardwood, 25-50 mg for softwood) taken from a one-gram handsheet made
from the pulp. The moisture content of the handsheet should be accurately
known so that the actual amount of fiber in the sample is known. This
weighed sample is then diluted to a known consistency (between about 2 and
about 10 mg/l) and a known volume (usually 200 ml) of the diluted pulp is
sampled. This 200 ml sample is further diluted to 600 ml and placed in the
analyzer. The final consistency of pulp slurry that is used to measure
coarseness is generally between about 0.67 and about 3.33 mg/liter. The
weight of pulp in this sample may be calculated from the sample volume and
the original weight and moisture content of the pulp that was sampled from
the handsheet. This weight is entered into the analyzer and the coarseness
test is run according to the operating manual's instructions.</p>
    <p num="0027">Coarseness values are usually reported in mg/100 meters. Fiber
lengths are reported in millimeters. For instruments of this type, three
average fiber length measurements are usually reported. These
measurements are often referred to as the number-weighted or arithmetic
average fiber length (I<sub>n</sub>), the length-weighted fiber length (I<sub>w</sub>) and the weight-weighted
fiber length (I<sub>z</sub>). The arithmetic average length is the sum of the
product of the number of fibers measured and the length of the fiber divided
by the sum of the number of fibers measured. The length-weighted average 
fiber length is defined as the sum of the product of the number of fibers
measured and the length of each fiber squared divided by the sum of the
product of the number of fibers measured and the length of the fiber. The
weight-weighted average fiber length is defined as the sum of the product of
the number of fibers measured and the length of the fiber cubed divided by
the sum of the product of the number of fibers and the length of the fiber
squared. It is the weight-weighted fiber length that is used in describing the
fiber lengths of the current invention.</p>
    <p num="0028">A major advantage of one embodiment of the current invention is that it
allows the use of coarser hardwoods and softwoods to produce ultra-soft
tissues. Hardwoods having coarseness values of up to about 15 mg/100 m
and softwoods with a coarseness of up to about 35 mg/100 m may be
employed in the furnish, though, of course, lower-coarseness pulps may also
be included in the furnish. These coarser fibers not only have the advantage
of lower cost; but CWP products produced from such pulps are also often
perceived by consumers as being thicker and stronger than similar tissues
made from only low-coarseness fibers. The product of the present invention
will preferably include from about 30 to about 85 percent of a first fiber,
typically a hardwood, having a coarseness of about 15 mg/100 m or less and
a fiber length of from about 0.8 to about 1.8 mm, more preferably having a
coarseness of about 13.5 mg/100m or less and a fiber length of from about
0.8 to about 1.4 mm and most preferably having a coarseness of about 12 or
less and a fiber length of from about 0.8 to about 1.2 mm. The product will
also preferably include from about 15 to about 70 percent of a second fiber,
typically a softwood having a coarseness of no more than about 35 mg/100 
meters and a fiber length of at least about 2.0 mm, more preferably a
coarseness of not more than about 30 mg/100 meters and a fiber length of at
least about 2.2 mm and most preferably a coarseness of no more than about
25 mg/100 meters and a fiber length of at least about 2.5 mm. Other fibers
including recycled fiber and non-woody fibers may also be included; however,
if present, they would typically constitute no more than about 70 percent of the
tissue's total furnish. Recycled fibers, if included, would preferably replace
both hardwood and softwood in an about 3/1 to about 4/1 HW/SW Ratio. The
coarseness of the total furnish would preferably be in the range of from about
7 to about 18 mg/100 meters.</p>
    <p num="0029">The product of the current invention may be prepared either as a
homogenous or a stratified product. If a stratified product is produced, each
sheet would typically be composed of at least two layers. The first layer
would constitute from about 20 to about 50 percent of the total sheet and
would be made chiefly or entirely of the first fibers described above. This
layer would be on the side of the sheet that is adhered to the Yankee dryer
during papermaking and would appear on the outside of the final embossed
product. The remaining layers of the sheet can be composed of the second
fibers described above or blends of the first and second fibers. Optionally,
other fibers or fiber blends such as recycled fiber and broke, if present, can be
included. If such fibers are present, they are usually located chiefly or
exclusively in the non-Yankee-side, i.e., air-side, layers.</p>
    <p num="0030">In many cases, particularly when a stratified machine is used, starches
and debonders can be advantageously used simultaneously. In other cases 
starches, debonders or mixtures thereof may be supplied to the wet end while
softeners and/or debonders may be applied by spraying.</p>
    <p num="0031">Suitable softeners and debonders, however, will be readily apparent to
the skilled artisan. Suitable softeners and debonders are widely described in
the patent literature. A comprehensive but non-exhaustive list includes U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,795,530; 5,225,047; 5,399,241; 3,844,880; 3,554,863;
3,554,862; 4,795,530; 4,720,383; 5,223,0965,262,007; 5,312,522; 5,354,425;
5,145,737; and EPA 0 675 225, each of which is specifically incorporated
herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="0032">These softeners are suitably nitrogen containing organic compounds
preferably cationic nitrogenous softeners and may be selected from trivalent
and tetravalent cationic organic nitrogen compounds incorporating long fatty
acid chains; compounds including imidazolines, amino acid salts, linear amine
amides, tetravalent or quaternary ammonium salts, or mixtures of the
foregoing. Other suitable softeners include the amphoteric softeners which
may consist of mixtures of such compounds as lecithin, polyethylene glycol
(PEG), castor oil, and lanolin.</p>
    <p num="0033">The present invention may be used with a particular class of softener
materials -- amido amine salts derived from partially acid neutralized amines.
Such materials are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,720,383; column 3,
lines 40-41. Also relevant are the following articles: Evans, <u style="single">Chemistry and
Industry,</u> 5 July 1969, pp. 893-903; Egan, <u style="single">J. Am. Oil Chemist's Soc.</u>, Vol. 55
(1978), pp. 118-121; and Trivedi et al, <u style="single">J. Am. Oil Chemist's Soc.,</u> June 1981,
pp. 754-756. All of the above are incorporated herein by reference in their
entirety. As indicated therein, softeners are often available commercially only 
as complex mixtures rather than as single compounds. While this discussion
will focus on the predominant species, it should be understood that
commercially available mixtures would generally be used to practice this
invention.</p>
    <p num="0034">The softener having a charge, usually cationic, can be supplied to the
furnish prior to web formation, applied directly onto the partially dewatered
web or may be applied by both methods in combination. Alternatively, the
softener may be applied to the completely dried, creped sheet, either on the
paper machine or during the converting process. Softeners having no charge
are applied at the dry end of the paper making process.</p>
    <p num="0035">The softener employed for treatment of the furnish is provided at a
treatment level that is sufficient to impart a perceptible degree of softness to
the paper product but less than an amount that would cause significant
runnability and sheet strength problems in the final commercial product. The
amount of softener employed, on a 100% active basis, is suitably up to about
10 pounds per ton of furnish; preferably from about 0.5 to about 7 pounds per
ton of furnish.</p>
    <p num="0036">Imidazoline-based softeners that are added to the furnish prior to its
formation into a web have been found to be particularly effective in producing
soft tissue products and constitute a preferred embodiment of this invention.
Of particular utility for producing the soft tissue product of this invention are
the cold-water dispersible imidazolines. These imidazolines are mixed with
alcohols or diols, which render the usually insoluble imidazolines water
dispersible. </p>
    <p num="0037">Treatment of the partially dewatered web with the softener can be
accomplished in various ways. For instance, the treatment step can
constitute spraying, applying with a direct contact applicator, or by employing
an applicator felt. It is often preferred to supply the softener to the air side of
the web so as to avoid chemical contamination of the paper making process.
It has been found in practice that a softener applied to the web from either
side penetrates the entire web and uniformly treats it.</p>
    <p num="0038">Useful softeners for spray application include softeners having the
following structure:

wherein R is the residue of a fatty acid having from 12 to 22 carbon atoms, R'
is a lower alkyl group, and X is an anion.</p>
    <p num="0039">Another suitable softener is a dialkyl dimethyl fatty quaterary
ammonium compound of the following structure:
<img id="img-00190001" orientation="unknown" wi="40" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00190001.tif" inline="no" he="27"/> 
wherein R and R<sup>1</sup> are the same or different and are aliphatic hydrocarbons
having fourteen to twenty carbon atoms preferably the hydrocarbons are
selected from the following: C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>35</sub> and C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>37</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0040">A new class of softeners are imidazolines which have a melting point of
from about 0 °C to about 40 °C in aliphatic diols, alkoxylated aliphatic diols, or
a mixture of aliphatic diols and alkoxylated aliphatic diols. These are useful in
the manufacture of the tissues of this invention. The imidazoline moiety in
aliphatic polyols, aliphatic diols, alkoxylated aliphatic polyols, alkoxylated
aliphatic diols or in a mixture of these compounds, functions as a softener and
is dispersible in water at a temperature of from about 1 °C to about 40 °C.
The imidazoline moiety is of the formula:
<img id="img-00200001" orientation="unknown" wi="67" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00200001.tif" inline="no" he="53"/>
wherein X is an anion and R is selected from the group of saturated and
unsaturated parafinic moieties having a carbon chain of C<sub>12</sub> to C<sub>20</sub> and R<sup>1</sup> is
selected from the groups of methyl and ethyl moieties. Suitably the anion is
methyl sulfate of the chloride moiety. The preferred carbon chain length is C<sub>12</sub>
to C<sub>18</sub>. The preferred diol is 2,2,4 trimethyl 1,3 pentane diol and the preferred
alkoxylated diol is ethoxylated 2,2,4 trimethyl 1,3 pentane diol. </p>
    <p num="0041">After the web is formed, it can be sprayed with from at least about 0.5
to about 3.5 lbs/ton of softener, more preferably about 0.5 to about 2 Ibs/ton of
softener. Alternatively, a softener may be incorporated into the wet end of the
process to result in a web including at least about 0.5 Ibs/ton of softener. It
will be understood by the skilled artisan that spraying of the softener may
occur after two webs have been joined to form a two-ply product.</p>
    <p num="0042">The pulp can be mixed with temporary wet strength-adjusting agents.
The pulp preferably contains up to about 10 Ibs/ton of one or more strength
adjusting agents, more preferably up to about 5 Ibs/ton, still more preferably
about 2 to about 3 Ibs. Suitable wet strength agents have an organic moiety
and suitably include water soluble aliphatic dialdehydes or commercially
available water soluble organic polymers including aldehydic units, and
cationic starches containing aldehyde moieties. These agents may be used
singly or in combination with each other.</p>
    <p num="0043">Suitable temporary wet strength agents are aliphatic and aromatic
aldehydes including glyoxal, malonic dialdehyde, succinic dialdehyde,
glutaraldehyde, dialdehyde starches, polymeric reaction products of
monomers or polymers having aldehyde groups and optionally nitrogen
groups. Representative nitrogen containing polymers which can suitably be
reacted with the aldehyde containing monomers or polymers include vinylamides,
acrylamides and related nitrogen containing polymers. These
polymers impart a positive charge to the aldehyde containing reaction
product.</p>
    <p num="0044">We have found that condensates prepared from dialdehydes such as
glyoxal or cyclic urea and polyol both containing aldehyde moieties are useful 
for producing temporary wet strength. Since these condensates do not have
a charge, they are added to the web before or after the pressing roll or
charged directly on the Yankee surface. Preferably these temporary wet
strength agents are sprayed on the air side of the web prior to drying on the
Yankee.</p>
    <p num="0045">The preparation of cyclic ureas is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,625,029,
which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other U.S. Patents of
interest disclosing reaction products of dialdehydes with polyols include U.S.
Patents 4,656,296; 4,547,580; and 4,537,634 and are also incorporated into
this application by reference in their entirety. The dialdehyde moieties
expressed in the polyols render the whole polyol useful as a temporary wet
strength agent in the manufacture of tissue according to the present invention.
Suitable polyols are reaction products of dialdehydes such as glyoxal with
polyols having at least a third hydroxyl group. Glycerin, sorbitol, dextrose,
glycerin monoacrylate, and glycerin monomaleic acid ester are representative
polyols useful as temporary wet strength agents.</p>
    <p num="0046">Polysaccharide aldehyde derivatives are suitable for use in the
manufacture of tissue according to the present invention. The polysaccharide
aldehydes are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,983,748 and 4,675,394. These

moiety suitable for use in the manufacture of the tissue of the present
invention and can be charged with the furnish.</p>
    <p num="0047">A starch of this type can also be used without other aldehyde moieties
but, in general, should be used in combination with a cationic softener.</p>

    <p num="0049">The temporary wet strength resin may be any one of a variety of water
soluble organic polymers comprising aldehydic units and cationic units used
to increase the dry and wet tensile strength of a paper product. Such resins

prepared by preheating an aqueous slurry of approximately 5% solids
maintained at a temperature of approximately 240° Fahrenheit and a pH of
about 2.7 for approximately 3.5 minutes. Finally, the slurry is quenched and

    <p num="0052">Typical temporary strength adjusting agents are well known to the
skilled artisan and the method and amounts for their effective use are also
understood by the skilled artisan. Preferred temporary wet strength agents
which may be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to,
glyoxylated polyacrylamide, glyoxal and modified starches.</p>
    <p num="0053">In accordance with one embodiment of the process of the present
invention, a first nascent web is formed from the pulp. The web can be
formed using any of the standard wet press configurations known to the
skilled artisan, e.g., crescent former, suction breast roll, twin-wire former, etc.
Once the web is formed, it preferably has a basis weight, under TAPPI LAB
CONDITIONS of at least about 9 Ibs/3000 sq. ft. ream, preferably at least
about 10 lbs/3000 sq. ft. ream, more preferably at least about 12-14 Ibs/3000
sq. ft. ream. TAPPI LAB-CONDITIONS refers to TAPPI T-402 test methods
specifying time, temperature and humidity conditions for a sequence of
conditioning steps.</p>
    <p num="0054">The web is then dewatered preferably by an overall compaction
process. The web is then preferably adhered to a Yankee dryer. Any suitable
art recognized adhesive may be used on the Yankee dryer. Suitable
adhesives are widely described in the patent literature. A comprehensive but
non-exhaustive list includes U.S. Patent Nos. 5,246,544; 4,304,625;
4,064,213; 4,501,640; 4,528,316; 4,883,564; 4,684,439; 4,886,579;
5,374,334; 5,382,323; 4,094,718; and 5,281,307. Typical release agents can
be used in accordance with the present invention. </p>
    <p num="0055">The web is then creped from the Yankee dryer and optionally
calendered. Creping is preferably carried out at a creping angle of from about
70° to about 88°, preferably about 73° to about 85° and more preferably at
about 80°.</p>
    <p num="0056">The product according to the present invention is a multi-ply product.
Two or more plies of tissue are adhered to one another preferably by the use
of knurling wheels, embossing and perforating the two plies together, and/or
the use of adhesives. One embodiment of the present invention is an emboss
process as shown in Figure 4. In this process, cellulosic webs 11 and 12,
supplied from parent rolls 21 and 22, are embossed separately between
emboss rolls 31 and 32 and backing rolls 41 and 42. The two embossed
webs are married such that the protrusions transferred to the webs 11 and 12
are in a face-to-face relationship on the inside of the two-ply web 13.
Because the two plies have been embossed separately, it is necessary to
marry them together to keep them from separating during use. This marrying
may be done by passing the combined web 13 through the nip formed by a
knurling wheel 61 and an anvil roll 71, as shown in Figure 4. Typically, there
are a plurality of knurling wheels arranged along the width of the web so that
all individual tissue rolls that are cut from the finished roll 51 have at least one
knurl holding the two plies together. Other methods of joining the two
embossed plies together, such as ply gluing, may also be used. Again, the
combined web 13 may be perfed and/or calendered (not shown) prior to being
wound onto the finished roll 51.</p>
    <p num="0057">The emboss pattern used to produce the patterns in the current
invention may be any art-recognized pattern. The two patterns may be 
identical or of different design. In one preferred embodiment, the two patterns
are mirror images of each other. Preferably, at least one of the patterns
contains macro and micro elements. Micro elements will generally be more
numerous and of much finer scale than the macro elements typically used in
conventional embossing patterns.</p>
    <p num="0058">It should be noted that, although the embossed webs are joined such
that the embossed portions of the two webs are facing each other, it is not
necessary that the patterns formed by the emboss rolls be particularly aligned
with respect to each other. Because of this feature, the setup time for this
process is less than that used in the case of point-to-point or nested
embossing, where the protrusions formed during embossing must be aligned
such that the protrusions contact each other (as in point-to-point embossing)
or that the protrusions on one web contact unembossed areas on the other
web (as in nested embossing).</p>
    <p num="0059">Another embodiment of the current invention as shown in Figure 5, is
an emboss process wherein only one of the webs is embossed. In this case
the web 12, which is embossed between the emboss roll 31 and the backing
roll 41, is combined with an unembossed web 11 such that the protrusions
formed in the web 12 by the embossing process are joined with the web 11 on
the inside of the combined web. As was the case for the embodiment where
both webs were embossed, the two-ply web 13 must have its plies married
together. Again, this marrying may be done by knurling, as shown in Figure 5,
by gluing the two plies together, combinations thereof, or by any other art-recognized
process. As was the case for the embodiment of the invention 
where both plies are embossed, emboss patterns that contain macro and
micro elements are preferred.</p>
    <p num="0060">Although the processes of the current invention have been described
for two-ply structures, it should be obvious to one skilled in the art that these
processes can be extended to include structures made up of three or more
plies. In such cases, two of the plies could be joined together prior to
embossing and joining with the other ply or plies. Alternatively, one or more
unembossed plies could be sandwiched between the embossed plies such
that the protrusions from each embossed ply contact an unembossed ply on
the inside of the sheet. Such variations are within the scope of the current
invention.</p>
    <p num="0061">In one alternative embodiment, the two plies may be adhered using an
adhesive either alone or in conjunction with an embossing or knurling pattern.
Suitable adhesives are well known and will be readily apparent to the skilled
artisan. According to this embodiment, the two plies are embossed with
adhesive being applied only to the tips of the raised bosses of the product and
ultimately located between the two plies of the product.
The calendering and embossing of the webs preferably combines to
form a multi-ply web having a specific caliper of the multi-ply web of at least
about 2 mils/8 sheets/lb. basis weight, more preferably from about 2.5 to
about 5 mils/8 sheets/lb basis weight and most preferably from about 3.0 to
about 4.5 mils/8 sheets/lb basis weight.</p>
    <p num="0062">The caliper of the tissue of the present invention may be measured
using the Model II Electronic Thickness Tester available from the Thwing-Albert
Instrument Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The caliper is 
measured on a sample consisting of a stack of eight sheets of tissue using a
two-inch diameter anvil at a 539 ±10 gram dead weight load.</p>
    <p num="0063">The bulk density of a tissue product is determined by immersing a
sample of the product in a nonswelling liquid and measuring the amount of
liquid absorbed by the sample. Care should be taken to insure that the
sample to be tested has been subjected to minimal handling. To measure
bulk density, a one-inch by one-inch sample of the tissue is cut and weighed
to 0.0001 gram. Using self-holding tweezers to grasp the tissue specimen at
a corner, the sample is then completely immersed in Porofil 3 Wetting Liquid.
Porofil 3 Wetting Liquid can be obtained from Coulter Electronics of Hialeah,
Florida. The sample is immersed for ten seconds. Then, using tweezers, the
sample is removed from the liquid and allowed to drain for thirty seconds
while being held suspended. Care should be taken not to shake the sample
during draining. After the tissue specimen has been drained, one of its
corners is lightly touched to blotter paper to remove any excess liquid. The
specimen is then transferred to a balance and the sample's wet weight is
obtained to the nearest 0.0001 gram. The bulk density is expressed in %
weight gain and is obtained using the formula: Bulk Density (%) = [(Wet
weight - Dry weight)/Dry Weight] * 100. Bulk Density has been found to
positively correlate with several important tissue attributes; consequently,
higher bulk density values are preferred.</p>
    <p num="0064">The tensile stiffness (also referred to as stiffness modulus or tensile
modulus) is determined by the procedure for measuring tensile strength
described below, except that a sample width of 1 inch is used and the
modulus recorded is the chord slope of the load/elongation curve measured 
over the range of 0-50 grams load. The tensile stiffness of a tissue product is
the geometric mean of the values obtained by measuring the tensile stiffness
in machine and cross-machine directions. The specific tensile stiffness of the
web is preferably less than about 2.0 g/inch/% strain per pound of basis
weight and more preferably less than about 1.0 g/inch/ % strain per pound of
basis weight, most preferably less than about 0.75 g/inch/ % strain per pound
of basis weight.</p>
    <p num="0065">Tensile strength of tissue produced in accordance with the present
invention is measured in the machine direction and cross-machine direction
on an Instron Model 4000: Series IX tensile tester with the gauge length set to
3 inches. The area of tissue tested is assumed to be 3 inches wide by 3
inches long (the distance between the grips). In practice, the length of the
samples is the distance between lines of perforation in the case of machine
direction tensile strength and the width of the samples is the width of the roll in
the case of cross-machine direction tensile strength. A 20 pound load cell
with heavyweight grips applied to the total width of the sample is employed.
The maximum load is recorded for each direction. The results are reported in
units of "grams per 3-inch"; a more complete rendering of the units would be
"grams per 3-inch by 3-inch strip." The geometric mean tensile of the present
invention, when normalized for basis weight, will preferably be between about
21 and about 35 grams per 3 inches per pound per ream. The ratio of MD to
CD tensile is also important and is preferably between about 1.25 and about
3, more preferably between about 1.5 and about 2.5. </p>
    <p num="0066">Throughout this application, by basis weight, we mean basis weight in
pounds per 3000 square ft. ream of the web. Many of the values provided
throughout the specification have been normalized.</p>
    <p num="0067">The wet tensile of the tissue of the present invention is measured using
a three-inch wide strip of tissue that is folded into a loop, clamped in a special
fixture termed a Finch Cup, then immersed in a water. The Finch Cup, which
is available from the Thwing-Albert Instrument Company of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, is mounted onto a tensile tester equipped with a 2.0 pound load
cell with the flange of the Finch Cup clamped by the tester's lower jaw and the
ends of tissue loop clamped into the upper jaw of the tensile tester. The
sample is immersed in water that has been adjusted to a pH of 7.0 ± 0.1 and
the tensile is tested after a 5 second immersion time. For temporary wet
strength grades, the wet tensile of the present invention will be at least about
1.5 grams per three inches per pound per ream in the cross direction as
measured using the Finch Cup, more preferably at least about 2 and most
preferably at least about 2.5. Normally, only the cross direction wet tensile is
tested, as the strength in this direction is normally lower than that of the
machine direction and the tissue is more likely to fail in use in the cross-machine
direction.</p>
    <p num="0068">For bath tissue, it is important that the product's wet strength be of a
temporary nature, so that the tissue will disintegrate fairly quickly after use
without posing a clogging problem for the toilet or its associated plumbing.
Insuring that a product's wet strength is temporary can be accomplished by
the same wet tensile test described above with the soak time increased from
five seconds to a longer time period. By comparing the sheet's initial wet 
tensile strength (5 second soak) to that obtained after longer soak times, the
percent wet tensile remaining can be calculated. The wet strength of a
product can be considered to be temporary as long as no more than about
50% of the tissue's initial wet strength (measured in the cross-machine
direction) remains after a soak time of 10 minutes.</p>
    <p num="0069">Softness is a quality that does not lend itself to easy quantification.
J.D. Bates, in "Softness Index: Fact or Mirage?" <u style="single">TAPPI</u>, Vol. 48 (1965), No. 4,
pp. 63A-64A, indicates that the two most important readily quantifiable
properties for predicting perceived softness are (a) roughness and (b) what
may be referred to as stiffness modulus. Tissue produced according to the
present invention has a more pleasing texture as measured by the sidedness
parameter or reduced values of either or both roughness and stiffness
modulus (relative to control samples). Surface roughness can be evaluated
by measuring average deviation in the average friction (GM MMD) using a
Kawabata KES-SE Friction Tester equipped with a fingerprint-type sensing
unit using the low sensitivity range. A 50 g stylus weight is used, and the
instrument readout is divided by 20 to obtain the mean deviation. The
geometric mean deviation in the average surface friction is then the square
root of the product of the average or mean deviation in the machine direction
and the cross-machine direction.</p>
    <p num="0070">Surface roughness can also be evaluated according to the TMI
method, which is used herein. The TMI method is preferred when evaluating
surface friction and sidedness values. Although the above procedure is
described in the context of the Kawabata equipment, the friction values noted
herein are expressed in TMI units . Friction values can be roughly converted 
between Kawabata and TMI units although we have found that results from
the Kawabata instruments seem to be considerably less reproducible and, in
our opinion, are far less useful in predicting perceived softness. Although we
find that there is a very significant amount of scatter between Kawabata
results and TMI results, the following equation may be used for approximate
conversion between Kawabata friction units and TMI friction units: TMI
friction = 6.1642 (Kawabata Friction) - 0.65194.</p>

The software for the Lab Master Slip and Friction tester is modified to allow it
to: (1) retrieve and directly record instantaneous data on the force exerted on
the friction sensor as it moves across the samples; (2) compute an average 
for that data; (3) calculate the deviation - absolute value of the difference
between each of the instantaneous data points and the calculated mean; and
(4) calculate a mean deviation over the scan to be reported in grams.</p>
    <p num="0072">Prior to testing, the test samples should be conditioned in an
atmosphere of 23.0° ± 1° C (73.4° ± 1.8° F) and 50% ± 2% R.H. Testing
should also be conducted at these conditions. The samples should be
handled by edges and corners only and any touching of the area of the
sample to be tested should be minimized as the samples are delicate, and
physical properties may be easily changed by rough handling or transfer of
oils from the hands of the tester.</p>
    <p num="0073">The samples to be tested are cut using a paper cutter to get straight
edges, any sheets with obvious imperfections being removed and replaced
with acceptable sheets. The sheets should be maintained, where applicable,
in consecutive order.</p>

inconvenient to obtain the plies before the marrying process, it is generally
acceptable to obtain the plies by separating the plies of the finished multi-ply

    <p num="0085">Formation of tissues of the present invention, as represented by
Kajaani Formation Index Number, should be at least about 54, preferably
about 60, more preferably at least about 62, as determined by measurement
of transmitted light intensity variations over the area of a single sheet of the
tissue product using a Kajaani Paperlab 1 Formation Analyzer which
compares the transmitivity of about 250,000 subregions of the sheet. The
Kajaani Formation Index Number, which varies between about 20 and 122, is
widely used through the paper industry and is for practical purposes identical 
to the Robotest Number which is simply an older term for the same

    <p num="0086"><u style="single">TAPPI</u> 401 OM-88 (Revised 1988) provides a procedure for the
identification of the types of fibers present in a sample of paper or paperboard
and an estimate of their quantity. Analysis of the amount of the
softener/debonder chemicals retained on the tissue paper can be performed
by any method accepted in the applicable art. For the most sensitive cases,
we prefer to use x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ESCA to measure nitrogen
content, the amounts in a certain location within the tissue sheet being
measurable by using the tape pull procedure described above combined with
ESCA analysis of each "split." Normally the background level is quite high
and the variation between measurements quite high, so use of several
replicates in a relatively modern ESCA system such as at the Perkin Elmer
Corporation's model 5,600 is required to obtain more precise measurements.
The level of cationic nitrogenous softener/debonder such as Quasoft® 202-JR
can alternatively be determined by solvent extraction of the softener/debonder
by an organic solvent followed by liquid chromatography determination of the
softener/debonder. <u style="single">TAPPI</u> 419 OM-85 provides the qualitative and

    <p num="0087">The typical tissue embossing process relating to multi-ply tissues
involves the compression and stretching of the flat tissue base sheets 
between a relatively soft (40 Shore A) rubber roll and a hard roll which has
relatively large "macro" signature emboss elements. This embossing
improves the aesthetics of the tissue and the structure of the tissue roll.
However, the thickness of the base sheet between the signature emboss
elements is actually reduced. This lowers the perceived bulk of a CWP
product made by this process. Also, in conventional products this process
makes the tissue two-sided, as the male emboss elements create protrusions
or knobs on only one side of the sheet.</p>
    <p num="0088">Smaller, closely spaced "micro" elements can be added to the emboss
pattern to improve the perceived bulk of the rubber to steel embossed
product. However, this results in a harsh product in conventionally embossed
products. This is because small elements in a rubber to steel process create
many small, stiff protrusions on one side of the tissue, resulting in a high
roughness. However, in the practice of the present invention the small stiff
protrusions are concealed between the plies of the finished product, obviating
this problem.</p>
    <p num="0089">According to one embodiment of the process of the present invention,
one web of the tissue is embossed between an emboss roll and a rubber
backup roll. The other web can also be embossed between an emboss roll
and a rubber backup roll or can be unembossed. The webs are then
combined in a manner so as to dispose the embossed side(s) having
protrusions to the interior of the finished multi-ply product.</p>
    <p num="0090">Figure 6 illustrates a conventional embossed two-ply tissue where two
unembossed plies are joined and embossed together. Indentations 101, 102,
103, and 104 are impressed in the top web 100 creating protrusions 201, 202, 
203, and 204 in the bottom web 200. This emboss imparts an increased
roughness on one side of the product creating an increased overall sidedness
of the two-ply tissue.</p>
    <p num="0091">Figure 7 illustrates one embossing embodiment of the present
invention where each ply is separately embossed then joined together.
The top web 300 is embossed creating indentations 301, 302, 303, and 304
which result in protrusions on the other side of the web. The bottom web 400
is separately embossed creating indentations 401, 402, 403, and 404 which
result in protrusions on the other side of the web. The two embossed webs
are married such that the protrusions on the webs 300 and 400 are in a face-to-face
relationship on the inside of the two-ply tissue. It is not necessary that
the protrusions on one ply be aligned with the protrusions on the other.</p>
    <p num="0092">Figure 8 illustrates another embossing embodiment of the present
invention where one ply is separately embossed then married together with an
unembossed ply. The top web is embossed creating indentations 500, 501,
502, and 503 which result in protrusions on the other side of the web. The
bottom web 600 is not embossed. The two webs are married such that the
protrusions on the embossed web are disposed on the interior of the two-ply
tissue.</p>
    <p num="0093">Figure 9 illustrates another embossing embodiment of the present
invention where each ply is separately embossed then married together. The
top web 700 is embossed creating macro pattern indentations 601, 602, and
603 and micro pattern indentations 611 which result in protrusions on the
other side of the web. The bottom web 800 is separately embossed creating
indentations 701, 702, and 703 and micro pattern indentations 711 which 
result in protrusions on the other side of the web. The two embossed webs
are married such that the protrusions on the webs 700 and 800 are in a face-to-face,
but not necessarily aligned, relationship on the inside of the two-ply
tissue.</p>
    <p num="0094">Figure 10 illustrates another embossing embodiment of the present
invention where one ply is separately embossed then married with an
unembossed ply. The top web 900 is embossed creating macro pattern
indentations 901, 902, and 903 and micro pattern indentations 911 which
result in protrusions on the other side of the web. The bottom web 1000 is not
embossed. The two webs are married such that the protrusions on the
embossed web are disposed on the interior of the two-ply tissue.</p>
    <p num="0095">Figures 11 and 12 depict a preferred emboss pattern for use with the
present invention. A more preferred pattern according to the present
invention includes "micro" elements. More preferred emboss patterns for the
present invention are shown in Figures 13 and 14. These patterns are exact
mirror images of one another. This emboss pattern combines circular micro
dots with a large, signature or "macro" pattern. This combination pattern
provides aesthetic appeal from the macro pattern as well as the improvement

Two finished product prototypes were produced using the base sheet
described above. The first of these prototypes employed emboss technology
of the prior art, where two base sheets were plied together prior to embossing
and both sheets are embossed using a single nip as shown in Figure 3. The
emboss pattern used is shown in Figure 11. The emboss penetration was
0.080 inches. After embossing, the product was calendered using the feed
rolls at a gap of 0.008 inches. The second of the prototypes employed the
technology of the current invention in which the individual sheets are 
embossed separately prior to being plied together. In this case, one of the
plies was embossed using the pattern shown in Figure 11, with the other ply
being embossed using the mirror image of the pattern shown in Figure 11.
This emboss pattern is shown in Figure 12. Each of the sheets was
embossed at a depth of 0.075 inches. The two sheets were plied together
such that the protrusions resulting from embossing the sheets are placed to
the inside of the product as shown in Figure 7. The two plies were joined to
each other using knurling wheels as shown in Figure 4. After knurling, the
tissue was calendered using the feed rolls, which were set at a gap of 0.007
inches.</p>
    <p num="0099">The physical properties of the two tissue products are shown in
Table 2. From the table, it can be seen that the product produced using the
current invention has a lower friction deviation, a higher bulk density, and a
higher sensory softness than does the product produced using the prior art.
All of these changes are positive with respect to tissue performance.

two converting methods. In the first of these methods, that of the prior art, all
three base sheet plies were passed together through the nip formed by the
emboss roll and the rubber backup roll. The emboss pattern used is shown in

which is the mirror image of the pattern shown in Figure 11. The three plies
were then joined together such that the protrusions produced by the emboss
nips were placed to the inside of the three-ply product, as shown in Figure 7.
The plies were joined by passing the product through knurling wheels which
were running against an anvil roll. After embossing and knurling, the product
was calendered using the feed rolls. The embossing conditions for the two
base sheets are shown in Table 4.

The embossed three-ply products were tested for physical properties and
sensory softness. The results of these tests are shown in Table 5. The table
shows that, for each base sheet, the product produced using the current
invention has a lower friction deviation, a higher bulk density, and a higher 
sensory softness than does the product produced using the prior art. All of
these changes are positive with respect to tissue performance.

    <p num="0101">Two-layer stratified base sheets were produced using different fibers
on the outer-layer of the tissue sheet. The first of these sheets employed a
top layer composed of a hardwood fiber having a fiber length of 1.33 mm.
and a coarseness of 11.1 mg/100 m. This layer constituted 44% of the total
sheet. This layer was stratified on top of a second layer that was composed
of an 88/18 blend of softwood fiber and broke. The softwood fiber had a fiber
length of 3.12 mm and a fiber coarseness of 17.8 mg/100 m. The total sheet
had a fiber length of 2.23 mm and a coarseness of 13.6 mg/100 m. The base
sheet was treated with a temporary wet strength additive at an addition level
of 1.75 Ibs/ton and a debonder at an addition level of 4.0 Ibs/ton. Both of 
these chemicals were added to the stock prior to its being formed into a tissue
sheet. An additional 0.5 Ibs/ton of the debonder was sprayed onto the formed
and partially dewatered sheet while it was on the felt. The second of the two
stratified sheets had a top layer composed of a hardwood having a fiber
length of 0.97 mm and a coarseness of 8.3 mg/100 m. This layer, which
comprised 38% of the total sheet, was stratified over a second layer
composed of an 84/16 blend of softwood and broke. The softwood fiber used
in this second layer was the same as that used in the second layer of the first
base sheet. The total sheet had a fiber length of 2.20 mm and a coarseness
of 12.0 mg/100 m. Two and one-half pounds per ton of a temporary wet
strength agent and one pound per ton of a debonder were added to the
furnish prior to its formation into a tissue sheet. One-half of a pound per ton
of the debonder was also sprayed onto the formed and partially dewatered

It would be expected that the product produced using the second base sheet
would be softer than the product made from the first base sheet, as the
second product's outer layer has a lower coarseness than does the outer
layer of the first product. However, as Table 7 shows, both products have
similar softness values. This example demonstrates the ability of the current
invention to produce products of high softness even when furnish blends
containing high-coarseness fibers are used. </p>
    <heading>Example 4</heading>
    <p num="0102">To test consumer response to products of the current invention, the
tissue product produced from base sheet number 1 in Example 3 was fielded
in a Monadic Home Use Test (HUT). Monadic Home Use Tests are described
in the Blumkenship and Green textbook "State of the Art Marketing
Research", NTC Publishing Group, Lincolnwood, III, 1993. In this type of
consumer test, consumers are given a single product to use for several days
and are then asked to rate the product for overall performance as well as for
several product attributes. Each attribute is assigned a rating of "Excellent",
"Very Good", "Good", "Fair", or "Poor". For tabulation purposes, these ratings
are assigned numerical values from 1 to 5, with 5 corresponding to an
"Excellent" rating and 1 corresponding to a rating of "Poor". By totalling the
rating scores given by all respondents and dividing by the number of
respondents, an average attribute rating between 1 and 5 may be obtained.</p>
    <p num="0103">Table 8 shows the results of the Monadic HUT for the product of the
current invention. As a point of comparison, results from a high-weight, high-softness,
store-shelf product made using the prior art are also included. This
prior art product was composed of all low-coarseness fibers and had an

The results of the Monadic Home Use Test show that the product of the
current invention, although made from a relatively coarse fiber blend, is at
parity for softness to the prior art product, which is composed of all low-coarseness
fibers. The product of the current invention has a higher overall
rating compared to the prior art product.</p>
    <heading>Example 5</heading>
    <p num="0104">For conventionally-embossed products produced using prior-art
technology, the embossing process creates finished, embossed sheets that
are quite different on the top and bottom of the product sheet with respect to
texture and feel. The top of the sheet is the side of the product on the outside
of the finished tissue roll, while the bottom of the sheet faces the inside of the
roll. This difference results from the action of the emboss elements in the nip
that create depressions on the side of the sheet that is against the hard
emboss roll (the top) and corresponding protrusions on the side of the sheet
that is against the softer rubber backing roll (the bottom) during the
embossing process. This process results in a product with quite different
surface characteristics on the top and bottom of the sheet. In addition, the 
protrusions on the bottom side of the sheet can detract from the perceived
softness of the product. The product of the current invention, by contrast,
eliminates the possibility of the protrusions detracting from the product's
softness, as these features of the product are located on the inside of the
finished product sheet where they are not contacted by the user. Also, the
products of the current invention have a similar texture on both sides of the
sheet, which results in both sides of the tissue feeling the same to the user.</p>
    <p num="0105">To quantify the superiority of the products of the current invention with
respect to having a similar texture on both sides of the embossed sheet,
product samples made from the same base sheet but embossed using either
the prior art technology or the process of the current invention, were
measured using laser profilometry. The tissue of the prior art was embossed
using the pattern shown in Figure 11 with the method shown in Figure 3. The
product of the current invention had one side of the product embossed using
the same pattern, while the other side was embossed using the pattern shown
in Figure 12, which is the mirror image of the pattern shown in Figure 11 using
the process shown in Figure 4. The profilometer used in this test is the UBM
Micro Focus Laser Profilometer type 2010, which is available from UBM Corp.
Scans of both of the surfaces of each of the two products were taken, with the
scans concentrating on the round emboss elements that make up the
pattern's "quilted" background lattice. The top and bottom surfaces of each
product were scanned using the profilometer to generate a surface profile.
One example of such a profile is shown in Figure 15. From this profile, a
parameter known as the "ISO 10 Point Height" can be calculated. This
measure of surface roughness or irregularity is defined as the arithmetic 
average of the 5 highest profile peaks and the 5 lowest profile valleys over the
entire scan. Peaks and valleys are defined as profile sections between two
consecutive intersections with the center line. These values were calculated
for both sides of the products made using the two emboss technologies. The
results of the test are shown in Table 9. As can be seen, there is little
difference between the top and bottom of the product embossed using the
current invention's technology. By contrast, the values for the top and bottom
of the product embossed using the prior art are quite different, indicating a
substantial difference in texture between the two sides of the product.

    <p num="0124">Prototypes A through D were made by embossing the aforementioned
base sheet with prior art technology and technology of the current invention.
Column 2 of Table 24 describes how the prototypes were embossed.</p>
    <p num="0125">The stack height test method was used to generate the stack height
and spring back data set forth in Table 24 and Figure 20. A napkin stack
height gauge was used to record data using a sample of 150 sheets. The
measuring platen was lifted and the sample placed into the gauge. The
height of the sample was measured prior to compression to record the initial
height. The weighted platen was then lowered so that it came to rest gently
on the top of the sample by its own weight. After one minute the height of the
sample was measured to record the height under load. The platen was then
removed from the top of the sample and after one minute the sample height
was measured to record the spring back height.</p>
    <p num="0126">A tissue that has less % compression will be perceived as bulkier.
However, to feel soft, the tissue must have resiliency and spring back after a
load is removed. Furthermore, for enhanced absorbency and softness the
bulk of the product should not come solely from corrugating the product in
embossing, but should also have a less dense base structure. A higher bulk
density gain indicates a less dense structure.</p>
    <p num="0127">Table 24 and Figure 20 show that prototype C produced using the prior
art has much higher compression than the products of the current invention.
Also, percent spring back for the prototypes made using the current invention
are close to or higher than the percent spring back for prototype C. Also, the 
bulk density is significantly higher for each of the prototypes made with the
current invention. All of these results indicate that the prototypes made with
the same base sheet and the current invention would be perceived as bulkier,
softer and more absorbent than the prototype made with the prior art.

    <heading>Example 14</heading>
    <p num="0128">Specific preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated
and contrasted to the prior art in the following charts. Friction, sidedness, and
tensile values were calculated according to the formulas noted above.</p>
    <p num="0129">Products of the current invention have a combination of attributes
important to premium tissues including high thickness, low sidedness, and
high softness. One of the methods for improving the thickness of a tissue
product is by embossing. However, in products of the prior art, increased
levels of embossing tended to result in products that had higher values of
sidedness, which resulted from the projections corresponding to the emboss
elements that protruded from one side of the tissue product. In the current
invention, it has been possible to produce a product having low sidedness by
marrying a first embossed ply with a second ply that may or may not have 
been embossed, as illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 respectively. These
methods of embossing allow the projections created in the embossed ply or
plies to be located on the inside of the tissue, where they do not come in
contact with the user. For products of the current invention, the overall
sidedness of the multi-ply structure is less than about 0.6. This embossed ply
will have been embossed with an emboss pattern having an embossed area
of at least about 2%, preferably at least about 4%, more preferably at least
about 8%, and the level of embossing will have been to the extent that the first
embossed ply has a sidedness of at least 0.45. Emboss patterns having
higher embossed areas are preferred as they provide a more uniform
treatment of the base sheet and are useful in increasing the product's bulk
density by opening up the structure. Accordingly, patterns containing both
signature and micro elements, which tend to have higher levels of embossed
area are preferred over patterns than contain only signature elements. The
softness of the product of the current invention is maintained not only by its
low sidedness, but also by controlling the tensile strength of the finished
product, as it is well known that softness and strength are inversely related.
Accordingly, products of the current invention will have a geometric mean
tensile strength of no more than 800 grams/3 inches.</p>
    <p num="0130">In Table 25, the properties of several prior art products, as well as
those of products of the current invention are listed. The table shows the TMI
friction deviations and sidedness values measured for each of the two plies of
the tissue product as well as the friction deviation and sidedness of the
combined two-ply tissue product. In the table, the friction deviation and
sidedness values designated A/D refer to those measured for the composite 
product, while those designated A/B and C/D refer to the values measured for
the individual plies. The values designated A/B are those measured for the
product's top or outer ply, while those designated C/D are those measured for
the bottom or inner ply. Figures 21 and 22 graphically represent the data in
Table 25.</p>
    <p num="0131">Products of the current invention include Tissues 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
As can be seen from the table, all of these products have overall (A/D)
sidedness values of less than 0.6, while the sidedness of the embossed ply
(A/B) is at least 0.45 (for product 2, both plies are embossed). Prior art
Tissues 1, 5, 10, 11, 15, and 16 were embossed by the method illustrated in
Figure 3 in which both plies are joined prior to or at the emboss nip and are
embossed together. Prior art Tissues 12, 13, and 14, while meeting the
criteria of having an overall sidedness of less than 0.6 and an embossed ply
sidedness of at least 0.45, have geometric tensile values of greater than 800
grams/3 inches. Finally, prior art Tissue 6, which meets both the sideness
and strength criteria set out above is excluded from the current invention as
neither of its plies are embossed.</p>
    <p num="0132">The TAD Super Premium 2-Ply (Tissue 6) was presumably fabricated
from two identical sheets but when measured for surface friction slightly
different values are obtained. This was due to the need for separating the
multi-ply glued sheets of the product in order to obtain measurements for the
individual sheets. The slight difference in values is believed to be a result of
the residual glue that was measured on the resultant surface. <img id="img-00730001" orientation="unknown" wi="135" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00730001.tif" inline="no" he="229"/><img id="img-00740001" orientation="unknown" wi="141" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00740001.tif" inline="no" he="232"/><img id="img-00750001" orientation="unknown" wi="141" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00750001.tif" inline="no" he="232"/><img id="img-00760001" orientation="unknown" wi="90" img-format="tif" img-content="tb" file="00760001.tif" inline="no" he="230"/></p>
