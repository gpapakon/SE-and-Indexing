    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>1. Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a general-purpose
push switch used as a button in electronic equipment such
as a cellular phone or a multidirectional input device
for operation of electronic equipment such as a cellular
phone.</p>
    <heading>2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
    <p num="0002">Regarding the drawing for a conventional
multidirectional input device, Fig. 18 shows the main part
of a conventional multidirectional input device.</p>
    <p num="0003">A case 50 is a plastic box with an opening at the
top. It has an octagonal bottom wall 50a; projections
50d spaced at regular intervals which protrude upwards
from the bottom wall 50a; a side wall 50b standing upwards
from the side edge of the bottom wall 50a; and notches
50c made at intervals of approximately 90 degrees in the
side wall 50b.</p>
    <p num="0004">A first fixed contact 51 consists of a contact part
51a located at the top end and a terminal 51b extending
outwards from the contact part 51a; the first fixed contact
51 is embedded in the bottom wall 50a with the contact
part 51a exposed in the center of the bottom wall 50a.
A common contact 52 consists of a semicircular arch contact 
part 52a and a terminal 52b extending outwards from the
contact part 52a. This common contact 52 is embedded in
the bottom wall 50a with the bottom wall 50a exposed on
the surface of the bottom wall 50a, surrounding the contact
part 51a of the first fixed contact 51.</p>
    <p num="0005">A first movable contact 53 is made of metal. It
has the shape of a dome and rests on the bottom wall 50a
with its periphery guided by the projections 50d. With
the first movable contact 53 in place, its side edge 53a
remains in contact with the contact part 52a of the common
contact 52 and its top 53b faces the contact part 51a of
the first fixed contact 51. The first fixed contact 51,
common contact 52 and first movable contact 53 constitute
a push switch S.</p>
    <p num="0006">A guide 54 is made of plastic and has virtually the
shape of a dome. It has a base 54b with a through hole
54a at the top; an arm 54c supported on one side, extending
towards the center from the base 54b; and a spacer 54d
engaged with the arm 54c. This guide 54 is fixed by the
base 54b engaged with the projections 50d. Once the guide
54 is fixed in this way, the arm 54c faces the top of the
first movable contact 53.</p>
    <p num="0007">A coil spring 55 is made of a conductive metal. It
stands on the bottom wall 50a near the side wall 50b,
surrounding the first movable contact 53.</p>
    <p num="0008">A cover 60 is an octagonal flat plate with a through
hole 60a in the center. A second fixed contact 61 consists 
of a contact part 61a at the top end and a terminal 61b
bent at right angles from the contact part 61a. The second
fixed contact 61 is embedded in the cover 60 every
approximately 45 degrees with the terminal 61b exposed
on the lower face of the cover 60. The cover 60 and the
second fixed contact 61 are arranged so as to cover the
opening of the case 50, and a U-shaped metal leg 62 is
used to fix them between the case 50 and the leg 62.</p>
    <p num="0009">A handle 64 consists of a driving body 65, a second
movable contact 66 embedded in the driving body 65, and
a control shaft 67 spline-connected with the driving body
65. The driving body 65 is almost cylindrical and has
in its center a through hole 65a which runs from the top
to the bottom and has an oval bottom. The second movable
contact 66 is a conductive metal ring disc with
outward-stretching projections 66a arranged at intervals
of 90 degrees. The second movable contact 66 is embedded
at a level almost equal to the middle of the height of
the driving body 65. Made of plastic, the control shaft
67 has a cylinder 67a and an oval jaw 67b at the bottom
of the cylinder 67a. The cylinder 67a is inserted through
the through hole 65a from below the driving body 65 and
the jaw 67b is spline-connected with the driving body 65
to control the rotation of the control shaft 67.</p>
    <p num="0010">The handle 64 is tiltably housed in the case 50 and
the top 65b of the driving body 65 is tiltably supported
by the through hole 60a of the cover 60. The bottom 67c 
of the control shaft 67 is in contact with a spacer 54d;
the second movable contact 66 is held pressed up by the
coil spring 55 to be pressed against the contact part 61a
of the second fixed contact 61. Here, since the second
movable contact 66 is in contact with the coil spring 55,
there is always continuity between the second movable
contact 66 and the common contact 52. The second fixed
contact 61 and the second movable contact 66, held pressed
by the coil spring 55, constitute a tilt switch S6 which
normally stays closed. The projections 66a of the second
movable contact 66 engage with the notches 50c in the side
wall 50b to prevent rotation of the entire handle 64.</p>
    <p num="0011">Next, how the conventional multidirectional input
device operates will be explained. As the control shaft
67 is tilted in a desired direction, the handle 64 tilts
on a fulcrum C which is the point of contact between the
contact part 61a of the second fixed contact 61 and the
second movable contact 66 on the side opposite to the
tilting direction, and the tilt switch S6 on the side of
the fulcrum C stays ON while the tilt switch S6 on the
opposite side turns OFF. The coil spring 55's part on
the side opposite to the fulcrum C is contracted.</p>
    <p num="0012">Also, upon tilting of the handle 64, the bottom 67c
of the control shaft 67 bends down the arm 54c through
the spacer 54d so that the first movable contact 53 is
pressed and the push switch S5 turns ON.</p>
    <p num="0013">Then, as the pressure on the control shaft 67 is 
released, the coil spring 55 returns to its original state
and the second movable contact 66 returns to its original
state as well; as a consequence, the handle 64 returns
to its neutral position and the tilt switches S6 all turn
ON. The arm 54c and the first movable contact 53 return
to their original state due their elastic force so the
push switch S5 turns OFF again.</p>
    <p num="0014">When the control shaft 67 is pushed in axially with
the handle 64 in its neutral position, the control shaft
67 moves down as guided by the through hole 65a of the
driving body 65, which presses the first movable contact
53 to turn ON the push switch S5. Meanwhile, all the tilt
switches S6 stay ON. Then, as the pressure on the control
shaft 67 is released, the arm 54c and the first movable
contact 53 return to their original state due to their
elastic force so the push switch S5 turns OFF again and,
the control shaft 67 is pushed back by the arm 54c and
returns to its original state.</p>
    <p num="0015">In the conventional multidirectional input device,
which has the above-mentioned constitution, there has
been a problem that the overall height of the device has
to be large enough to accommodate the height of the coil
spring 55 in order to ensure that continuity is established
between the second movable contact 66 and the common
contact 52 through the coil spring 55.</p>
    <p num="0016">Another problem is that since the coil spring 55
is located near the side wall 50b and the common contact 
52 has to be placed around the first movable contact 53,
the device size should be relatively large.</p>
    <p num="0017">A further problem is that the shape of the common
contact 52 must be complicated in order to ensure that
the common contact 52 touches the coil spring 55. In
addition, since the arm 54c and spacer 54d lie between
the first movable contact 53 and the control shaft 67,
the overall height should be relatively large.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0018">In view of the above problems, the present invention
provides a low-profile, compact, multidirectional input
device which does not use the coil spring 55.</p>
    <p num="0019">As a first solution to the above problems, the
present invention provides a multidirectional input

    <p num="0021">As a third solution, in a multidirectional input
device according to the present invention, the casing has
an interface which is facing and opposite the bottom wall
with the first movable contact between the bottom wall
and it, and when the handle is in its neutral position,
it is pressed against a lower face of the interface due
to an elastic force of the second movable contact.</p>
    <p num="0022">As a fourth solution, in a multidirectional input
device according to the present invention, the handle or
the interface has an axially protruding projection, and
when the interface and handle touch each other through
the projection and with the handle in its neutral position, 
the first movable contact is out of contact with the first
fixed contact.</p>
    <p num="0023">As a fifth solution, in a multidirectional input
device according to the present invention, the first
movable contact has the projection (ridge) opposite the
interface.</p>
    <p num="0024">As a sixth solution, in a multidirectional input
device according to the present invention, when the handle
is tilted on the projection as a first fulcrum, the first
fixed contact and first movable contact touch each other,
and when it is tilted on the point of contact between the
first fixed contact and the first movable contact as a
second fulcrum, the second fixed contact and second
movable contact touch each other.</p>
    <p num="0025">As a seventh solution, in a multidirectional input
device according to the present invention, the interface
is a metal plate which is held and joined together with
the first fixed contact by a plastic support and the handle
has escapes through which convexes on the bottom wall side
of the support can come and go when it is tilted.</p>
    <p num="0026">As an eighth solution, in a multidirectional input
device according to the present invention, the casing
comprises a lower case having the bottom wall, and the
support as an upper case separate from the lower case;
the first fixed contact fitted to the upper case is fixed
on the lower case to join the lower case and the upper
case together. </p>
    <p num="0027">As a ninth solution, in a multidirectional input
device according to the present invention, when the handle
is pushed axially, the second fixed contact and the second
movable contact touch each other to establish continuity
between the common contact and the second fixed contact.</p>
    <p num="0028">As a tenth solution, in a multidirectional input
device according to the present invention, the second
movable contact comprises a dome-shaped leaf spring, and
the contact area of the first movable contact on the handle
is semispherical, protruding towards the bottom wall; and
an outer semispherical surface of the contact area touches
the second movable contact.</p>
    <p num="0029">As an eleventh solution, in a multidirectional
input device according to the present invention, the
second movable contact comprises a dome-shaped leaf
spring, and the contact area of the first movable contact
on the handle has a flat portion facing the second movable
contact; and the flat portion touches a top of the second
movable contact.</p>
    <p num="0030">As a twelfth solution, in a multidirectional input
device according to the present invention, the second
movable contact comprises a dome-shaped leaf spring, and
the contact area of the first movable contact on the handle
has a square or ring ridge protruding towards the second
movable contact; and the ridge touches the top of the
second movable contact.</p>
    <p num="0031">As a thirteenth solution, in a multidirectional 
input device according to the present invention, the
second movable contact comprises a dome-shaped leaf
spring, and the contact area of the first movable contact
on the handle has plural convexes protruding towards the

    <p num="0035">From now on, the multidirectional input device
according to the first embodiment of the present invention
will be described by reference to Figs. 1 to 13. As shown
in Figs. 3 to 5, a lower case 1 has a bottom wall 2 as
an octagonal flat plate, and a side wall 3 standing upright
from the periphery of the bottom wall 2 where the bottom
wall 2 has, in its center, four fan-shaped first holes
2a which run vertically, arranged along the circumference
of a circle, and a cross-shaped receiver 2b located between
these first holes 2a, and a pair of second holes 2c between
which the first holes 2a lie. There are four projections
2d facing each other on the upper side of the bottom wall
2 as shown in Fig. 3 and plural concaves 2e facing each 
other along the periphery of the lower face as shown in
Figs. 4 and 5.</p>
    <p num="0036">The side wall 3 is composed of four pairs of side
walls, where each pair consists of a side wall 3a having
a protrusion 3c extending towards the center, and a side
wall 3b located next to the first side wall 3a; these pairs
are arranged along the circumference of the bottom wall
so as to form an octagonal side wall 3.</p>
    <p num="0037">A second fixed contact 4, a metal plate, has a
circular contact part 4a and a terminal 4b which extends
outwards from the contact part 4a. The contact part 4a
is exposed on the surface of the bottom wall 2, covering
the first holes 2a, and the terminal 4b runs as follows:
it is embedded outwards, exposed on the bottom surface,
and again embedded, protruding sideward, with its tip
folded and housed in the concave 2e. On the back of the
contact part 4a of the second fixed contact 4 thus embedded
is the cross-shaped receiver 2b passing through the center.
The back of the contact part 4a is supported by this
receiver 2b.</p>
    <p num="0038">A common contact 5, a metal plate, has an arch base
5a, rectangular contact parts 5b at the ends of the base
5a, and a terminal 5c extending outwards from part of the
base 5a. The contact parts 5b are exposed on the surface
of the bottom wall 2 covering the pair of second holes
2c and the base 5a, located around the contact part 4a,
is exposed on the surface of the bottom wall 2 with the 
tip of the terminal 5c folded and housed in the concave
2e; the common contact 5 is embedded in the bottom wall
2 in this way.</p>
    <p num="0039">The second movable contact 6 consists of a metal
dome-shaped leaf spring. Guided by the four projections
2d on the bottom wall 2, it is placed on the surface of
the bottom wall 2. With the second movable contact 6 in
place, its periphery remains in contact with the contact
parts 5b of the common contact 5 and the top 6a can be
brought into or out of contact with the contact part 4a
of the second fixed contact 4. The movement of the second
movable contact 6 is limited by the projections 2d. The
second movable contact 6, second fixed contact 4 and common
contact 5 constitute a push switch S1.</p>
    <p num="0040">The handle 10 has a first movable contact 11 as a
thin, octagonal metal plate, and a plastic knob 12 having
the center of the first movable contact 11 embedded therein.
The first movable contact 11 has the following: an
octagonal ridge (convex projection) 11a which axially
protrudes upwards in a manner to surround the knob 12;
plural (eight) escapes 11b as triangular through holes
extending outwards from this ridge 11a with a fringe in
the periphery; concaves 11c around the fringe; and a
semispherical contact area lid in the center of the lower
face. The knob 12 is a virtually square pillar having
a thin plate base 12a and a pillar 12b with a square tip
extending upwards from the center of the base 12a. The 
contact area 11d in the center of the first movable contact
11 is embedded in the base 12a.</p>
    <p num="0041">When the first movable contact 11 is embedded in
the knob 12, the first movable contact 11 lies radially
extending outwards from the base 12a of the knob 12 and
the contact area 11d lies downwards, exposed on the lower
face of the base 12a. As shown in Fig. 2, there are plural
through holes 11e between the first movable contact 11
and the contact area 11d; these through holes 11e are
filled with resin and function as connections to join the
base 12a of the knob 12 to the pillar 12b.</p>
    <p num="0042">The handle 10 thus structured is tiltably housed
in the lower case 1 in which the second movable contact
6 is placed. Here, the projections 3c of the first side
wall 3 fit into the concaves 11c of the first movable
contact 11 and the first movable contact 11 is guided to
be housed in the lower case 1. The engagement of the
concaves 11c and the projections 3c works to stop rotation
of the handle 10. When the handle 10 is housed in the
lower case 1, the outer surface of the contact area lid
of the first movable contact 11 touches the second movable
contact 6. This means a contact between spherical
surfaces and enables the handle 10 to tilt smoothly.
Alternatively, the top 6a of the second movable contact
6 may be flat.</p>
    <p num="0043">Four first fixed contacts 15 are made of metal; each
of them consists of a virtually fan-shaped base 15a and 
a terminal 15b bent downwards from the base 15a, as shown
in Figs. 3 and 8. An interface 16 consists of a thin metal
plate which includes a ring 16b with an octagonal through
hole 16a in the center, and legs 16c extending in four
directions from the ring 16b. The interface 16b does not
always need to be made of metal; it may be made of rigid
plastic resin.</p>
    <p num="0044">The first fixed contacts 15 and the interface 16,
both made of plastic resin, are embedded in the support
17 which constitutes an upper case, and integrated and
fixed with the support 17. The support 17 is a plastic
molding; as shown in Figs. 3, 8 and 9, it is an octagonal
thin plate which has a substrate 17a with an octagonal
through hole 17d in the center, downward-protruding
triangular convexes 17b on the lower face of the substrate
17a, and joints 17c on the fringe of the substrate 17a
facing each other.</p>
    <p num="0045">The first fixed contacts 15 and the interface 16
are embedded and integrated, flush with the support 17.
As shown in Fig. 8, the first fixed contacts 15 are held
between the substrate 17a and the convexes 17b and
neighboring first fixed contacts 15 are jointed together
through the joints 17c. In the interface 16, located
nearer to the center than the first fixed contacts 15,
the ring 16b is held between the substrate 17a and the
convexes 17b and joined through the convexes 17b to the
first fixed contacts 15 with the through hole 16a connected 
in line with the through hole 17d of the support 17.</p>
    <p num="0046">The support 17 thus structured, in which the first
fixed contacts 15 and the interface 16 are embedded, is
fixed so as to serve as the upper case to cover the lower
case 1; the support 17 as the upper case, and the lower
case 1 make up a casing 7. As shown in Fig. 2, the
terminals 15b of the first fixed contacts 15 are bent
inwards to engage with the concaves 2e of the bottom wall
2e to fix the cases securely. The knob 12 of the handle
10 passes through the through hole 16a of the interface
16, protruding up.</p>
    <p num="0047">When the support 17 is fixed on the lower case 1,
the ridge 11a is pressed against the lower face of the
interface 16 by the handle 10 with the elastic force of
the second movable contact 6, as shown in Fig. 2. Once
the ridge 11a is placed against the back or lower face
of the interface 16, the first movable contact 11 is out
of contact with the fist fixed contacts 15. The first
movable contact 11 and the first fixed contacts 15 make
up a tilt switch S2. The switch is usually in the OFF
state, contributing to power saving.</p>
    <p num="0048">Referring to Fig. 10, the handle 10 can tilt on the
point of contact between the ridge 11a and the interface
16 as a first fulcrum A. As the handle 10 is tilted down,
the first fixed contact 15 and the first movable contact
11 touch each other, which establishes continuity between
a first fixed contact 15 and the common contact 5 through 
the first movable contact 11 and the second movable contact
6 (S2 turned ON) , generating a direction detecting signal
as a first electric signal. In other words, continuity
between the terminal 15b of the first fixed contact 15
and the common contact 5 is established (S2 turned ON),
generating a direction detecting signal.</p>
    <p num="0049">Referring to Fig. 11, when the handle 10 is further
tilted in the same direction, the handle 10 tilts on the
point of contact between the first fixed contact 15 and
the first movable contact 11 as a second fulcrum B. As
the contact area 11d goes down, it presses down the second
movable contact 6, which causes it to flip down, making
the top 6a touch the contact part 4a of the second fixed
contact 4. As a result, continuity between the common
contact 5 and the second fixed contact 4 is established
(S1 turned ON), generating a final signal as a second
electric signal. The convexes 17b can get into or out
of the escapes 11b of the first movable contact 11, which
facilitates and guides tilting of the handle 10 and helps
make a low-profile device.</p>
    <p num="0050">Made of metal, the cover 20 has a base plate 20b
with a circular through hole 20a in the center and legs
20c bent downwards from the two opposite sides of the base
plate 20b. The cover 20 thus structured covers the
surface of the support 17 and its legs 20c are bent inwards
to engage with the convexes 2e of the bottom wall 2,
securing the cover 20 in place. The cover 20 functions 
as an electrical shield and the legs 20c are connected
with the grand pattern, etc. formed on the circuit board
(not shown). This causes static electricity, etc. from
outside to flow through the grand pattern, increasing the
reliability in detection.</p>
    <p num="0051">The structure of the multidirectional input device
according to the present invention has been described so
far. Next, how it operates will be explained referring
to Figs. 10 and 11. As the handle 10 is tilted in one
of the directions of the first fixed contacts 15 arranged
like a cross, the handle 10 tilts down on the first fulcrum
A, which causes the first movable contact 11 and a first
fixed contact 15 to touch each other and a direction
detecting signal as the first electric signal is entered
into the microcomputer provided on the circuit board (not
shown). When the handle 10 is tilted further, it tilts
down on the second fulcrum B and the contact area lid
presses down the second movable contact 6, which then
touches the second fixed contact 4. When the second fixed
contact 4 and the second movable contact 6 come into
contact with each other, a final signal as the second
electric signal is entered into the microcomputer (not
shown) , which then outputs a signal for tilting direction
confirmation (final direction signal) to an external
electric appliance. At this moment, the operator gets
a clicking sensation upon the flipping action of the second
movable contact 6 and therefore can know that the final 
direction signal has been generated.</p>
    <p num="0052">As the pressure on the handle 10 is released, the
second movable contact 6 returns to its original state
elastically; this elastic force presses the contact area
11d upwards, makes the ridge 11a touch the interface 16.
As a consequence, the handle 10 automatically returns to
its neutral position or the condition shown in Fig. 2 is
restored. When the handle 10 is again in the neutral
position, the second fixed contact 4 and the second movable
contact 6 are out of contact with each other, and the first
fixed contacts 15 and the first movable contact 11 are
also apart from each other. This means that both switches
S1 and S2 are in the OFF state, contributing to power
saving.</p>
    <p num="0053">The handle 10 can be moved in eight directions. As
the handle 10 is tilted in one (oblique) direction between
neighboring ones of the first fixed contacts 15 arranged
like a cross, the two first fixed contacts 15 and the second
movable contact 11 touch each other and a first electric
signal is entered into the microcomputer, which then
recognizes that the handle 10 has been tilted obliquely.
When the handle 10 is further tilted down, the push switch
S1 is activated and the final signal is entered into the
microcomputer, as mentioned above.</p>
    <p num="0054">Referring to Fig. 10, when the fringe of the handle
10 is located closer to the inner wall of the side wall
3 of the lower case 1 and thus the fringe of the handle 
10 slides on the inner wall as the handle 10 is tilted,
this sliding motion causes the handle 10 to shift in the
direction opposite to the tilting direction. Due to this
shift, the fringe of the first movable contact 11 on the
opposite of the tilting side slides in touch with the first
fixed contact 15, which prevents dust from entering the
contact part and may remove dust. Alternatively, instead
of further tilting the handle 10 on the first fulcrum A,
it may be pressed axially to make the second fixed contact
4 and the second movable contact 6 touch each other to
turn ON the switch S1.</p>
    <p num="0055">When the handle 10 in its neutral state is pushed
axially, the first fixed contacts 15 and the first movable
contact 11 are out of contact with each other, namely the
tilt switch S2 is in the OFF state, while the second fixed
contact 4 and the second movable contact 6 are in contact
with each other, namely the push switch S1 is the ON state;
thus only the second electric signal is entered into the
microcomputer. In this case, the microcomputer outputs
the signal from the independent push switch S1 to an
external electric appliance.</p>
    <p num="0056">When the handle 10 is tilted and pushed, the second
movable contact 6 repeatedly flips down with its top 6a
in contact with the contact part 4a of the second fixed
contact 4 and a downward pressure is repeatedly applied
to the contact part 4a. Since the contact part 4a is
supported by the cross receiver 2b, it does not deform 
and stably touches or leaves the top 6a for switching
operation.</p>
    <p num="0057">Next, the method for manufacturing the push switch
S1 will be described referring to Figs. 12 and 13. An
upper mold 25 has a first through hole 25a which runs
vertically; a pair of second through holes 25b which
sandwich the first through hole 25a; and an octagonal,
shallow first concave 25c, while a lower mold 26 has an
octagonal ring as a second concave 26a and a gate 26b which
extends outwards and is partially connected with the
second concave 26a. The upper mold 25 and the lower mold
26 are joined to make a cavity 27 through the first and
second concaves 25c and 26a.</p>
    <p num="0058">A first pin 28 is a metal cylinder which has a cross
groove 28a cut at the tip. This first pin 28 is vertically
movably held in the first through hole 25a. The second
pins 29 are metal cylinders which are vertically movably
held in the second through holes 25b. A contact plate
30, a metal hoop, has the second fixed contact 4 and the
common contact 5 which are formed by press working.</p>
    <p num="0059">The hoop contact plate 30 having the second fixed
contact 4 and common contact 6 is placed between the upper
mold 25 and the lower mold 26 and the upper and lower molds
25 and 26 are clamped. Here, the tip (groove 28a) of the
vertically movable first pin 28 should be pressed against
the back of the contact part 4a of the second fixed contact
4 to ensure that there is no gap between the contact part 
4a, located inside the cavity 27, and the lower mold 26,
with the cross groove 28a lying on the back of the contact
part 4a. Also, the pair of second pins 29, which are
vertically movable like the first pin 28, should be pressed
against the back of the contact parts 5b of the second
common contacts 5 to ensure that the contact parts 5b,
located inside the cavity 27, do not move due to the molten
resin pressure.</p>
    <p num="0060">Then, thermoplastic resin such as polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) is injected into the cavity 27 through
the gate 26b until it is filled, so that the lower case
1 is formed with the second fixed contact 4 and common
contact 5 embedded therein. Since the first pin 28 has
the cross groove 28a, the groove 28a is filled with molten
resin to form a cross receiver 2b which should support
the contact part 4a of the second fixed contact 4. After
the first pin 28 is removed, it is found that four first
holes 2a have been formed on the back of the contact part
4a. After the second pins 29 are removed, it is found
that second holes 2c have been formed extending from the
back of the contact parts 5b of the second common contact
5.</p>
    <p num="0061">A multidirectional input device according to a
second embodiment of the present invention will be
described referring to Fig. 14. Fig. 14 is a sectional
view of the main part of a multidirectional input device
according to the second embodiment of the present 
invention.</p>
    <p num="0062">Regarding the multidirectional input device
according to the second embodiment of the present
invention, unlike the first embodiment in which the first
movable contact 11 is a flat plate, in the second
embodiment, the first movable contact 11 has a point of
level difference 11f and a sectional profile of a flat
plate with an elevated portion in the center as illustrated
in Fig. 14. The point of level difference 11f divides
the first movable contact 11 into two portions: an upper
portion 11g located in the center, and a lower portion
11k as a peripheral area.</p>
    <p num="0063">On the surface of the first movable contact 11 are
plural first convexes 11h as projections protruding
upwards from the upper portion 11g as well as second
convexes 11m as projections protruding upwards from the
vicinity of the edge of the lower portion 11k. An upper
cover 21 consists of an upper portion 21b and a lower
portion 21c which are divided by a point of level
difference 21a; when the handle 64 is in its neutral
position, the first convexes 11h are pressed against the
back of the upper portion 21b while the second convexes
11m are out of contact with the back of the lower portion
21c, so that the tilt switch S2, composed of the first
movable contact 11 and the upper cover 21, is in the OFF
state. In other words, because the upward movement of
the first convexes 11h is limited by the upper portion 
21b of the upper cover 21, the second convexes 11m are
out of contact with the back of the lower portion 21c.
The other components are identical to those in the first
embodiment; they are respectively marked with the same
reference numerals and their explanation is omitted here.</p>
    <p num="0064">Next, how the multidirectional input device
according to the second embodiment operates will be
explained. As the handle 10 is tilted in a desired
direction, it tilts on the point of contact C between a
first convex 11h and the upper portion 21b of the upper
cover 21 as a first fulcrum, which causes a second convex
11m and the lower portion 11k to touch each other and turns
ON the tilt switch S2, generating a direction detecting
signal as a first electric signal. When the handle 10
is further tilted, the second movable contact 6 is pressed
down by the contact area 11d with the point of contact
between a second convex 11m and the lower portion 11k as
a second fulcrum (not shown) ; as a result, it touches the
second fixed contact 4 to turn ON the push switch S1,
generating a final signal as a second electric signal.
As in the first embodiment, when the pressure on the handle
10 is released, the second movable contact 6 returns to
its original state and the handle 10 automatically returns
to its neutral position; when the handle 10 in the neutral
position is pushed axially, the push switch S1
independently turns ON. Alternatively, the top 6a of the
second movable contact 6 may be flat. </p>
    <p num="0065">A multidirectional input device according to a
third embodiment of the present invention will be
described referring to Figs. 15 and 16. Fig. 15 is a
sectional view of the main part of a multidirectional input
device according to the third embodiment of the present
invention and Fig. 16 is a sectional view illustrating
how the multidirectional input device according to the
third embodiment of the present invention operates.</p>
    <p num="0066">Regarding the multidirectional input device
according to the third embodiment of the present invention,
unlike the first embodiment in which the contact area 11d
of the first movable contact 11 is semispherical, in the
third embodiment, the contact area 11d has a flat portion
11n facing the second movable contact 6 and the flat
portion 11n can be brought into or out of contact with
the top 6a of the second movable contact 6.</p>
    <p num="0067">Due to this structure, when the handle 10 in its
neutral position is pushed axially, the flat portion 11n
presses the top 6a of the second movable contact 6 and
flips it down and as a result of the axial movement of
the handle 10, the push switch S1 turns ON. The presence
of the flat portion 11n minimizes the possibility that
the handle 10 accidentally tilts when it is pushed axially.
This makes it possible to turn ON the push switch S1 only
stably. Alternatively, the top 6a of the second movable
contact 6 may be flat. If so, the flat planes of the top
6a and the flat portion 11n touch each other, so the push 
switch S1 only can be turned ON with more stability. Even
if the top 6a is flat, the edge of the flat portion 11n
is rounded, so the handle 10 can be tilted relatively
smoothly. The other components are identical to those
in the first embodiment; they are respectively marked with
the same reference numerals and their explanation is
omitted here.</p>
    <p num="0068">A multidirectional input device according to a
fourth embodiment of the present invention will be
described referring to Fig. 17. Fig. 17 is a sectional
view of the main part of a multidirectional input device
according to the fourth embodiment of the present
invention.</p>
    <p num="0069">Regarding the multidirectional input device
according to the fourth embodiment of the present
invention, unlike the first embodiment in which the
contact area 11d of the first movable contact 11 is
semispherical, in the fourth embodiment, the contact area
11d has a ring ridge 11p protruding towards the second
movable contact 6 and the ridge 11p can be brought into
or out of contact with the top 6a of the second movable
contact 6.</p>
    <p num="0070">Due to this structure, when the handle 10 in its
neutral position is pushed axially, the ridge 11p presses
the top 6a of the second movable contact 6 and flips it
down and as a result of the axial movement of the handle
10, the push switch S1 turns ON. The presence of the ridge 
11p minimizes the possibility that the handle 10
accidentally tilts when it is pushed axially. This makes
it possible to turn ON the push switch S1 only stably.
Alternatively, the top 6a of the second movable contact
6 may be flat. If so, only the push switch S1 can be turned
ON with more stability. Even if the top 6a is flat, the
ridge 11p is chamfered or rounded, so the handle 10 can
be tilted relatively smoothly. The ridge 11p may also
be a polygon such as a rectangle or octagon. Also, it
is acceptable that the ridge 11p consists of plural arch
ridges instead of a single ridge ring. Or it may consist
of plural discrete ridges (projections). These ridges
may be arranged along the circumference of a circle or
polygon. The other components are identical to those in
the first embodiment; they are respectively marked with
the same reference numerals and their explanation is
omitted here.</p>
    <p num="0071">Obviously, a multidirectional input device
according to the present invention may also be available
in forms other than the above-mentioned. In the
above-mentioned first, third and fourth embodiments, the
first movable contact 11 has a ridge (projection) 11a,
while in the second embodiment, it has first convexes 11h
as projections protruding upwards. Alternatively, it
may have a projection or projections protruding downwards
from the interface 16 or the upper portion 21b of the upper
cover 21. Although the casing 7 is a combination of a 
lower case 1 and a support 17 in the above-mentioned
embodiments, it may also be integrally formed as a single
component. In the first and second embodiments, the
handle 10 has a first movable contact exposed at least
partially on its lower or upper surface which is
constructed by insert molding; instead, the first movable
contact 11 may be joined with the base 12a of the knob
12 by caulking so as to cover it, namely the side face
of the base 12a may be used to join the upper and lower
surfaces. It is also acceptable that the whole handle
10 is made of metal.</p>
    <p num="0072">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, the second movable contact is in
contact with the handle having the first movable contact.
This eliminates the need for a coil spring as used in the
prior art, making it possible to construct a compact,
low-profile device. Further, the shape of the common
contact 5 is simpler. The contact area 11d and the second
movable contact 6 can directly touch each other, which
eliminates the need for the arm 54 and spacer 54d as used
in the prior art, contributing to a decrease in the
thinness of the device.</p>
    <p num="0073">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, when the handle is tilted down, a first
electric signal is generated and the second fixed contact
and the second movable contact touch each other and
continuity is established between the common contact and 
the second fixed contact, generating a second electric
signal. Therefore, it is possible to provide a compact,
low-profile multidirectional input device with a simpler
structure which generates first and second electric
signals.</p>
    <p num="0074">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, the casing has an interface facing the
bottom wall with the first movable contact between it and
the bottom wall, and when the handle is in its neutral
position, the handle is pressed against the lower face
of the interface due to the elastic force of the second
movable contact. The handle is thus held against the
interface. Therefore, it is possible to provide a
compact stable multidirectional input device with a
simpler structure.</p>
    <p num="0075">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, the handle or the interface has an
axially protruding projection and the interface and
handle touch each other through the projection, and when
the handle is in its neutral position, the first movable
contact is out of contact with the first fixed contact.
This facilitates tilting of the handle and ensures that
the first movable contact is off the first fixed contact
to keep the switch in the OFF state stably.</p>
    <p num="0076">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, the first movable contact has a ridge
(convex projection) opposite the interface, so the ridge 
can be easily formed and the handle can be tilted in
different directions smoothly.</p>
    <p num="0077">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, when the handle is tilted on the first
fulcrum, the first fixed contact and first movable contact
touch each other, and when it is tilted on the second
fulcrum, the second fixed contact and second movable
contact touch each other. Accordingly, it is possible
to provide a multidirectional input device with a simpler
structure which enables operation of two switches.</p>
    <p num="0078">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, the interface is a metal plate and held
and joined together with the first fixed contact by the
plastic support and the handle has escapes through which
the convexes on the bottom wall side of the support come
and go when the handle is tilted. The metal plate
interface is rigid enough and the presence of the escapes
makes it possible to construct a low-profile device which
ensures smooth tilting of the handle.</p>
    <p num="0079">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, the first fixed contact is fixed on
the lower case to join the lower case and the upper case
together, which means that it is easy to assemble a
multidirectional input device and fix the upper case.</p>
    <p num="0080">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, when the handle is pushed axially, the
second fixed contact and the second movable contact touch 
each other and continuity is established between the
common contact and the second fixed contact. Therefore,
it is easy to provide a multidirectional input device with
an independent push switch.</p>
    <p num="0081">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, the second movable contact comprises
a dome-shaped leaf spring and the contact area of the first
movable contact is semispherical, protruding towards the
bottom wall. The outer semispherical surface of the
contact area is designed to touch the second movable
contact, which means that the outer semispherical surface
of the contact area moves on the second movable contact,
permitting smooth tilting of the handle.</p>
    <p num="0082">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, the second movable contact comprises
a dome-shaped leaf spring and the contact area of the first
movable contact has a flat portion facing the second
movable contact. The flat portion is designed to touch
the top of the second movable contact, which means that
the second movable contact can be stably operated and thus
a highly reliable multidirectional input device can be
provided.</p>
    <p num="0083">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, the second movable contact comprises
a dome-shaped leaf spring and the contact area of the first
movable contact has a square or ring ridge protruding
toward the second movable contact. The ridge is designed 
to touch the top of the second movable contact, which means
that the second movable contact can be stably operated
and thus a highly reliable multidirectional input device
can be provided.</p>
    <p num="0084">In a multidirectional input device according to the
present invention, the second movable contact comprises
a dome-shaped leaf spring and the contact area of the first
movable contact has plural convexes protruding toward the
second movable contact. The convexes are designed to
touch the top of the second movable contact, which means
that the second movable contact can be stably operated
and thus a highly reliable multidirectional input device
can be provided.</p>
