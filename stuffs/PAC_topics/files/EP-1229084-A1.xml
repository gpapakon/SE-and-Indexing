    <p>Reactive Red 23 magenta dye that is hydrolyzed to produce a passivated form having

      <b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention generally relates to ink-jet printing, and in particular to a specific form of
Reactive Red 23 magenta dye which is hydrolyzed to produce a passivated form with better
pH stability thus improving kogation, decap and lightfastness.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0002">The use of ink-jet printing systems has grown dramatically in recent years. This growth may
be attributed to substantial improvements in print resolution and overall print quality coupled
with appreciable reduction in cost. Today's ink-jet printers offer acceptable print quality for
many commercial, business, and household applications at costs fully an order of magnitude
lower than comparable products available just a few years ago. Notwithstanding their recent
success, intensive research and development efforts continue toward improving ink-jet print
quality. In general, ink-jet print quality still falls short of that produced by more expensive
technologies such as photography and offset or gravure printing. A surge in interest in ink-jet
imaging (e.g., the rendition of pictures) has resulted in the need to produce near photographic
quality printed images at a reasonable cost. The challenge remains to further improve the
image quality and lightfastness of ink-jet printed images, especially images containing skin
tones, without increasing their cost.</p>
    <p num="0003">If such an ink is to be used in an ink-jet printing device, characteristics such as crusting, long-term
stability, and materials compatibility must also be addressed. If the ink is to be used in a
thermal ink-jet printer, the further constraint of being thermally stable (kogation-resistant) is
added.</p>
    <p num="0004">In general, a successful ink set for color ink-jet printing must be compatible with the ink-jet
pen and printing system. Some of the required properties for the ink-jet ink include: good
crusting resistance, good stability, the proper viscosity, the proper surface tension, little color-to-color
bleed, rapid dry time, no negative reaction with the vehicle, high solubility of the dyes
in the vehicle, consumer safety, low strike through, high color saturation, and good dot gain. </p>
    <p num="0005">Color ink-jet printers typically use three inks of differing hues: magenta, yellow, and cyan.
Optionally black is also used. EP 662499 and EP 366121 both assigned to Canon disclose
the use of Reactive Red 23 in inkjet ink.</p>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0009">The present invention described herein is directed to ink-jet inks for printing ink-jet images
using commercially available ink-jet printers such as, for example but not limited to, HP
DeskJet® printers, manufactured by Hewlett-Packard Company, of Palo Alto, California. The
inks enable production of near photographic images having little or no coalescence, excellent 
waterfastness, and reduced dry time, on a range of print media, in particular, for example but
not limited to, plain white, 8 ½ " X 11", 20 Ib. weight, printer paper conventionally used for
office and home computers.</p>
    <p num="0010">RR23 is a very lightfast dye. The reactive portion of this dye molecule will hydrolyze over
time in an aqueous solution. It is known that when the reactive group of other inkjet dyes
(Reactive Red 180 and Reactive Black 31) is hydrolyzed over time, pH instability over the life
of the ink has resulted. The pH change and salts formed during hydrolysis over time
increase the occurrence of kogation, decap and lightfastness problems in an ink containing a
reactive dye .</p>
    <p num="0011">The present inventor has found that when RR23 is passivated initially by hydrolyzing the
reactive sulfate group of the dye that a more stable dye results with better characteristics of
pH stability, kogation, decap and lightfastness. The passivation can occur under acid or
alkaline conditions. In a preferred embodiment the passivation occurs under alkaline
conditions and in a more preferred embodiment the passivation occurs at a pH of at least 9.</p>
    <p num="0012">In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a high lightfastness magenta dye
comprising hydrolyzed Reactive Red 23 with from 0 to 100% hydroxy form and from 0 to
100% vinyl form:
<img id="img-00050001" orientation="unknown" wi="137" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00050001.tif" inline="no" he="60"/><img id="img-00060001" orientation="unknown" wi="130" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060001.tif" inline="no" he="65"/>
In a preferred embodiment of the high lightfastness magenta dye of the present invention, at
least 50% of the hydrolyzed Reactive Red 23 is the hydroxy form.</p>
    <p num="0013">In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a set of ink-jet inks for ink-jet
printing, at least one of the inks being a magenta ink comprising a high lightfastness magenta
dye, the high lightfastness magenta dye comprising hydrolyzed Reactive Red 23 with from 0
to 100% hydroxy form and from 0 to 100% vinyl form:
<img id="img-00060002" orientation="unknown" wi="134" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00060002.tif" inline="no" he="67"/><img id="img-00070001" orientation="unknown" wi="132" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00070001.tif" inline="no" he="66"/></p>
    <p num="0014">In a preferred embodiment of the set of ink-jet inks of the present invention,
at least 50% of the hydrolyzed Reactive Red 23 is the hydroxy form.</p>
    <p num="0015">In another preferred embodiment of the set of ink-jet inks of the present invention, at least one
of the inks is a cyan ink comprising a cyan dye; and at least one of the inks is
a yellow ink comprising a yellow dye.</p>
    <p num="0016">In yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of making a passivated
form of Reactive Red 23 comprising
hydrolyzing Reactive Red 23 to obtain hydrolyzed Reactive Red 23 with from 0 to 100%
hydroxy form and from 0 to 100% vinyl form. <img id="img-00080001" orientation="unknown" wi="147" img-format="tif" img-content="cf" file="00080001.tif" inline="no" he="195"/></p>
    <p num="0017">In a preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention, hydrolyzing the Reactive
Red 23 is conducted at a pH of at least 9.</p>
    <p num="0018">In another preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention, at least 50% of the
hydrolyzed Reactive Red 23 is the hydroxy form. </p>

    <p num="0019">The extent of real time fade of inkjet printed samples of passivated Reactive Red 23 was
compared directly to similar inkjet printed samples of Magenta 377. Real time fade was
measured by determining the original optical density of the inkjet printed samples and the
faded optical density of the samples after 7.5 months of exposure to office light. The results
are shown in the following table. Reactive red 23 was shown to fade 37% in 7.5 months,
