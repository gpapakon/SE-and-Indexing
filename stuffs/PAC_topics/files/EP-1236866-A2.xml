      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <heading>
      <b>Field of Invention</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0001">This invention, as used in a supercharger (an exhaust
gas turbocharger) of internal combustion engines or the so
forth, relates to the adjustable nozzle mechanism for
variable capacity turbines and its production method, with
regard to the radial flow turbine configured to make the
actuating gas flow from the spiral scroll formed in the
turbine casing to the turbine rotor in the radial axis
through the multiple nozzle vanes having wings of variable
angle.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>Description of the Related Art</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0002">In order to make a good match with regard to the
internal combustion engine, between the outflow exhaust gas
volume from the engine and the actuating gas flow volume
which should be determined for the optimum operation
condition of the supercharger, variable capacity
superchargers, equipped with the variable capacity turbine
capable of changing the exhaust gas volume to be sent from
the spiral scroll to the turbine rotor in accordance with the
operation condition of the engine, have been in widespread
use in recent years.

   A supercharger with such a variable capacity turbine is
equipped with the adjustable nozzle mechanism in order to
change the wing angle of the nozzle vane by rotating the
nozzle vane with the link assembly so that it is capable of
being driven for rotations around said turbine rotor shaft by
the actuator through the actuator rod and the driving lever. </p>
    <p num="0003">For the method to achieve assembling and adjustment of
such variable nozzle mechanism, an invention of Japanese
patent number 3,085,210 has been proposed.</p>
    <p num="0004">In the concerned invention, a jig should be placed in
the inner radius of the nozzle vane to perform the setup for
perfect closing of the nozzle vane and the link assembly to
be driven for rotations around the turbine rotor shaft. The
jig therein can be put in contact with the rear edge of the
nozzle vane, wherein the stopper pin is mounted after the
nozzle vane and the lever plates are welded together upon
putting the nozzle vane in contact with the jig in the state
that the stopper pin, that is to be fitted into the long
slots given at the multiple positions along the
circumferential direction of the link plate, is made non-functional
or non-existing, and upon fitting the matching pin
into the phase matching hole to finalize the entire link
assembly in the perfect closing phase.</p>
    <p num="0005">However, problems, such as the following, are concerned
with the invention of Japanese patent number 3,085,210. Two
different processes are required one of which is to put the
jig in contact with the nozzle vane in the nozzle vane-free
state wherein the stopper pin to be fitted into the long
slots of the link plate is non-functional, and the other is
to mount the stopper pin after welding the nozzle vane and
the lever plate in the perfect closing phase of the entire
link assembly with the matching pin fitted into the phase-matching
hole in the state. This in turn requires more
assembling jigs, making the adjustable nozzle mechanism
assembly and the related adjustment works troublesome, with
additional man-hours resulting in cost increase. </p>
    <p num="0006">In addition, on the basis of the conventional art in
which the structure becomes complex due to the link position
determining pin included therein with the stopper pin fitted
into the long slot at the multiple positions in the
circumferential direction of the link plate, the number of
the part category and the number of the parts themselves will
therefore increase considerably. As a result, the device
costs will increase accordingly.</p>
    <p num="0007">Furthermore, as the setup of the total adjustable nozzle
mechanism should be carried out by means of fitting the
stopper pin into the long slot at multiple positions in the
circumferential direction of the link plate and by means of
making a match of the relative angle of the contact of the
jig at the nozzle vane rear edge against the lever plate, the
setup of the perfect closing may vary to cause a setup error.
The perfect closing position of the adjustable nozzle
mechanism must be determined primarily by the dimensional
accuracy of the component parts, which may make it difficult
to obtain the proper setup accuracy.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0008">In consideration of the problems with the conventional
art mentioned above, the object of this invention is to
propose the method to realize assembly and adjustment, and
the related assembly and adjustment facilities for the
variable capacity turbine, requiring neither adjustment of
the perfect closing position in the nozzle assembly nor the
jigs for assembly and adjustment thereof, by which the
adjustment works can be simplified to decrease man-hours, as
well as assembly and adjustment costs. The structure can also 
be simplified to decrease part category numbers and the
number of the parts itself, thus decreasing part costs and
furthermore enabling the nozzle vane setup of the adjustable
nozzle mechanism to a comparatively high degree of accuracy
without being influenced by the degree of dimensional
accuracy of the component parts, such as the nozzle vane and
the link assembly.</p>
    <p num="0009">In order to solve the concerned problems, the variable
capacity turbine for applying this invention comprises; a
number of nozzle vanes, which are arranged along the
circumference of the turbine and provided on the nozzle
shafts which are supported on the turbine casing in such a
way that the nozzle vanes can rotate, and which vary the vane
angle; a nozzle driving member driving the nozzle vanes, and
enabled to rotate around the turbine shaft by the actuator;
and a turbine rotor set free for rotation inside the inner
radius of the nozzle vanes. The variable capacity turbine is
driven for rotation of the turbine rotor by flowing the
actuating gas from the scroll in the turbine casing toward
the inner radial direction through the nozzle vanes to the
turbine rotor.</p>
    <p num="0010">In the event of manufacturing the adjustable nozzle
mechanism used in such variable capacity turbine, it is
distinguished by the manufacturing method according to this
invention which comprises the steps of: providing a plurality
of joint members (lever plates) which are the same in number
as the nozzle shafts, and connect the plurality of nozzle
vanes and the nozzle driving member (link plate); fitting and
fixing each nozzle shaft to one end of each lever plate after
setting the predetermined positional relationship between the
wing angle of the nozzle vanes and the fitting direction of 
the fixing section of the lever plate; and engaging another
end of each lever plate with the nozzle driving member (link
plate).</p>
    <p num="0011">For the concrete fixing method of the nozzle shaft to
joint member (lever plate), the method comprises the steps
of: forming a coupling hole in each joint member (lever
plate), then forming a flat or curved surface on one sidewall
of each coupling hole; forming a coupling shaft provided with
a fitting surface on the end of the nozzle shaft for nozzle
vane, the fitting surface corresponding to the shape of the
coupling hole of the joint member (lever plate) for creating
a stopper; fitting the coupling shaft into the coupling hole
without causing plasticity deformation at the coupling shaft
or coupling hole, and engaging the stopper surface of the
shaft with the stopper surface on the coupling hole so that
the joint member (lever plate) and the nozzle shaft cannot
rotate relatively by the stopper, and finally processing for
anti-decoupling to prevent the nozzle shaft from squeezing
out of the side surface of the joint members by using the
chamfered portion having a larger diameter (chamfered
portion) at the edge portion of the nozzle shaft.</p>
    <p num="0012">The anti-decoupling is preferably processed by punching
the shaft edge of the coupling shaft by using the chamfered
portion at the edge after engaging the coupling hole of the
joint member with the coupling shaft of the nozzle shaft.

The anti-decoupling process thereof at the edge can be
substituted by a light welding or the like.</p>
    <p num="0013">This invention further features that the concrete
engaging method of the joint members (lever plate) with the
nozzle driving member (link plate) is to fit the slots with 
the fitting pins equal in number to the joint members. The
fitting pins protrude along the circumferential direction on
the nozzle driving member. The slots are opened in a nearly
radial axis on the other edge of each of the joint members to
engage with the fitting pins of the nozzle driving member.</p>
    <p num="0014">The variable capacity turbine for applying this
invention comprises; a number of nozzle vanes, which are
arranged along the circumference of the turbine and provided
on the nozzle shafts which are supported on the turbine
casing in such a way that the nozzle vanes can rotate, and
which vary the vane angle; a nozzle driving member driving
the nozzle vanes, and enabled to rotate around the turbine
shaft by the actuator; and a turbine rotor set free for'
rotation inside the inner radius of the nozzle vanes. The
variable capacity turbine is driven for rotation of the
turbine rotor by flowing the actuating gas from the scroll in
the turbine casing towards the inner radial direction through
the nozzle vanes to the turbine rotor.</p>
    <p num="0015">The adjustable nozzle mechanism used in such variable
capacity turbine is distinguished by the configuration,
comprising: a plurality of lever plates which are provided
between the nozzle mount and the link plate, one end of each
lever plate being fitted and fixed to each nozzle shaft after
setting the predetermined positional relationship between the
wing angle of the nozzle vanes and the fitting direction of
the fixing section of the lever plate, and the lever plate
being provided with a slot which is opened in a nearly radial
axis on the other edge; and the same number of fitting pins
protruding along the circumferential direction and toward the
lever plate side on the nozzle driving member, the fitting
pins being engaged with the slots of the lever plates. </p>
    <p num="0016">In accordance with this invention, adjustment of the
adjustable nozzle mechanism, that is, the position setup of
the wing angle of the nozzle vane and the nozzle driving
member, can be made in such extremely simple processes. In
this process, the coupling hole provided at one edge of the
lever plate and the coupling shaft at the end of the nozzle
shaft are fitted after being set up geometrically so that the
wing angle and the rotating angle of the link plate composing
the nozzle driving member may be in the predetermined
relation. The edge of the nozzle shaft is then punched into
one of the chamfered portion of the edge portion in order to
be fixed on the lever plate. Then the lever plate and the
link plate can be engaged to each other by engaging the pins
with the slots provided at the end of the lever plate.</p>
    <p num="0017">With these simplified processes, adjustment of the
adjustable nozzle mechanism during the nozzle assembly
procedure is no longer required and therefore the assembling
man-hours are decreased, particular assembling facilities
such as the jigs are not needed, and as a result, assembling
costs are decreased. The jigs are still required with the
invention of the Japanese patent number 3,085,210 in such a
way that the adjustment should be made for the perfect
closing position during nozzle assembly procedure by using
multiple long slots of the link plate, stopper pin and jigs.</p>
    <p num="0018">Furthermore, as the adjustable nozzle mechanism
according to this invention is configured in the manner that
the one edge side of the joint members (lever plate) and the
nozzle shaft are fixed upon the set geometrical relations
between thereto and the nozzle driving member (link plate)
are joined to the other edge side of each joint member, the 
structure is simplified comparatively with the conventional
art and the number of part category and parts itself are
considerably decreased. Part costs are decreased accordingly.</p>
    <p num="0019">Furthermore, with this invention, configured such that
the nozzle driving member is joined to the other edge of each
joint member after these have been fitted on the condition
that the wing angle of the nozzle vane and the rotating angle
of the nozzle driving member (link plate) had been set
previously in the geometrical relation as required, and that
adjustment of the adjustable nozzle mechanism, that is, the
position setup of the wing angle of the nozzle vane and the
nozzle driving member is available neither with a setting
error that would arise in the conventional art from the
variable setup for the perfect closing caused by the
adjustment for the perfect closing position during nozzle
assembling procedure using the multiple long slots, the
stopper pin and jig, nor the perfect closing position of the
adjustable nozzle mechanism should be determined primarily by
the component parts, the setup herein of the adjustable
nozzle mechanism is available to a high degree of accuracy
without fear of influence by the dimensional accuracy of the
nozzle assembly and the link assembly, as well as the
enabling of the various requirement settings of the
adjustable nozzle mechanism.</p>
    <p num="0020">Still furthermore, with this invention, configured such
that the lever plates equal in number to the nozzle vanes are
placed between the nozzle mount and the link plate in the
turbine shaft axis, that the one edge of the lever plate is
fixed on the nozzle shaft of the nozzle vane, that the
fitting pin protruding toward the lever plate side in the
link plate is fitted into the slots on the other edge of the 
lever plate, that the stopper between the lever plate and the
edge of the nozzle shaft is processed with the use of the
chamfered portion in order to prevent the stopper portion
from squeezing out of the side face of the lever plate, It
becomes possible to assemble the link plate and lever plate
with a minimum distance, therefore, the distant between the
link plate and the nozzle mount over the lever plate
sandwiched thereby becomes shorter, and the length in the
shaft axis of the adjustable nozzle mechanism is, as a
result, shortened.</p>
    <p num="0021">Still furthermore, the punched portion avoids protrusion
from the link plate side, and erroneous operation of the
adjustable nozzle mechanism by the friction and interference
between the link plate and the punched portion is also
avoided.</p>

the turbine casing 30. 34 is a turbine wheel, 35 is a
compressor wheel, 033 is a rotor shaft to join the turbine
wheel 34 to the compressor wheel 35, both of which compose

    <p num="0034">2 is a nozzle vane, as placed equidistant in multiple
along the circumferential direction of the turbine on the
inner radius of the scroll 38, and the nozzle shaft 02 formed
into thereof is supported for the rotary motion by the nozzle
mount 4 fixed on the turbine casing 30, the wing angle of
which is changeable.</p>
    <p num="0035">40 is the actuator rod, that is, the output end of the
actuator 040 to drive the nozzle vane 2, and the
reciprocating motion of the actuator rod 40 is converted
through the known link mechanism including the driving lever
41 into the rotating motion to be transferred to the link 
plate 3 of the adjustable nozzle mechanism 100 described
later.</p>
    <p num="0036">In the supercharger with the variable capacity turbine
in such composition, the exhaust gas from the internal
combustion engine (not shown in figures here) flows into the
scroll 38 and goes around along the spiral of the scroll 38
further to the nozzle vane 2. The exhaust gas runs through
the wings of the nozzle vane 2 to flow into the turbine rotor
wheel 34 from the outer radius side thereof, and, after
flowing in radial axis towards the shaft axis to perform the
expansion work, flows in the shaft axis to the outside from
the exhaust outlet 08.</p>
    <p num="0037">100 is the adjustable nozzle mechanism rotating the
nozzle vane 2 in order to change the wing angle thereof by
use of the link plate 3 driven in rotation around the
rotating shaft 8 of the turbine rotor 33 through the link
mechanism, including the actuator rod 40 and the driving
lever 41 from the actuator 040.</p>
    <p num="0038">This invention relates to the production method of such
an adjustable nozzle mechanism and the structure of the
adjustable nozzle mechanism 100 produced by such a method.</p>
    <p num="0039">In Figures 1 to 7 showing the preferred embodiments of
this invention, 3 is a link plate formed in the disk, being
joined to the actuator rod 40 for rotating motion around the
rotating shaft 8 through the link mechanism including the
driving lever 41 as described above.</p>
    <p num="0040">4 is the ring-shaped nozzle mount fixed on the turbine
casing 30. 7 is the nozzle support, four of which (or any 
plural number of which) are placed along the circumferential
direction between the nozzle mount 4 and the nozzle plate 12
as shown in Figure 7 to fix the nozzle mount 4 and the nozzle
plate 12. The coupling section on the nozzle plate 12 side of
the nozzle support 7 is processed for a detent function by
fitting the parallel shaft section 7a formed at the shaft
edge section of the nozzle support 7 into the parallel hole
section formed in the hole 12a of the nozzle plate 12, as
shown in Figure 5, to punch and fix the shaft edge of the
nozzle support 7 on the nozzle plate 12 through the washer
012.</p>
    <p num="0041">On the other hand, the nozzle vane 2 is placed at the
inner radius section of the nozzle support 7 between the
nozzle mount 4 and the nozzle plate 12, and the nozzle shaft
02 fixed thereon (or formed into the nozzle vane 2) is
supported for rotating motion.</p>
    <p num="0042">1 is the lever plate to compose the joint members
joining the link plate 3 to the nozzle shaft 02 on each
nozzle vane 2 side, being placed equal in number to the
nozzle vane 2, where one edge side thereof is fixed on the
nozzle shaft 02 and the other edge side is joined to the link
plate 3, as described later.</p>
    <p num="0043">As shown in Figures 2 and 4, the coupling hole 1b is
provided through to the nozzle shaft 02 on one edge side of
the lever plate 1. The coupling hole 1b forms an oblong shape
having stopper surface in hole 1d in parallel therein onto
each of the two opposite surfaces.</p>
    <p num="0044">On the other hand, the coupling shaft 02a is provided to
be fitted to the coupling hole 1b at the shaft edge of the 
nozzle shaft 02 of the nozzle vane 2. The coupling shaft 02a
forms in the same oblong shape as the coupling hole 1b to be
fitted thereto, and, as the stopper surface on shaft 02b
thereon in parallel to each other are attached to the stopper
surface in hole 1d, the lever plate 1 and the nozzle vane 2
are fitted firmly so as to disable relative rotation.</p>
    <p num="0045">After the coupling shaft 02a is fitted to the coupling
hole 1b, the edge portion of the coupling shaft 02a is
processed by punching (at 2a) to prevent from disconnection,
as shown in the Figure 2.</p>
    <p num="0046">As shown in Figures 3, 4 and 6, on the other edge side
of the each lever plate 1, slot 1c is formed in the radial
axis and the slot 1c is fitted with the fitting pin section
3a having the fitting pin 3 protruding towards the lever
plate in the same quantity as the lever plate 1 protruding
towards the lever plate 1 on the side surface of the lever
plate 1 of the link plate 3.</p>
    <p num="0047">And the lever plate 1 is placed between the nozzle mount
4 and the link plate 3 in the turbine shaft axis, and, as
described above, the one edge side, that is the inner radius
side, is fixed on the nozzle shaft 02 and the other edge
side, that is the outer radius side, is fixed on the fitting
pin section 3a of the link plate 3.</p>
    <p num="0048">In order to control the capacity of the variable
capacity turbine equipped with the adjustable nozzle
mechanism 100 in such a composition, the wing angle of the
nozzle vane 2 should be set up by means of wing angle control
(not shown in figures here) to the required flow volume of
the exhaust gas flowing through the nozzle vane 2 against the 
actuator 040. The reciprocating displacement of the actuator
040 corresponding to such wing angle is converted into
rotating motion by the link mechanism including the actuator
rod 40 and the driving lever 41, and transferred to the link
plate 3 to drive the link plate 3 for rotation.</p>
    <p num="0049">By the rotation of the link plate 3, each lever plate 1,
joined by the fitting of fitting pin section 3a and slot
section 1c to the link plate 3, is shaken around the shaft of
the nozzle shaft 02 by the shift of the fitting pin section
3a in the circumferential direction of the rotation by the
link plate 3, then the nozzle shaft 02 is rotated by the
rotation of lever plate 1, and the nozzle vane 2 rotates in
order to change itself to the wing angle set up by the
actuator 040.</p>
    <p num="0050">When fitting the coupling shaft section 02a of the
nozzle vane 2 to the coupling hole 1b of the lever plate 1 in
such an embodiment, the abovementioned stopper surface in
hole 1d of the coupling hole 1b and the stopper surface on
shaft 02b of the coupling shaft section 02a are attached to
be fitted after the wing angle of the nozzle vane 2 and the
rotating angle of the link plate 3 are set geometrically in
the required relation, and then processed for disconnection
prevention by punching the edge of the coupling shaft section
02a.</p>
    <p num="0051">In such a punching process, the outside of the coupling
hole 1b of the lever plate 1 is made as chamfered beforehand
as shown in Figure 2 (01b showing the chamfered portio), and
after the coupling hole 1b of the lever plate 1 and the
coupling shaft section 02a of the nozzle shaft 02 are fitted,
the coupling shaft section 02a is punched along the chamfered 
portion 01b. At this time, a punching process is taken in use
of the chamfered portion 01b so that the punched part 2a at
the shaft edge of the coupling shaft 02a may not squeeze out
towards the inside from the side surface 1a of the lever
plate 1.</p>
    <p num="0052">By such a punching process, the punched part 2a of the
nozzle shaft 02 avoids protrusion from the link plate 3,
erroneous operation of the adjustable nozzle mechanism 100 by
friction between the protruding part and the link plate 3 is
prevented, the distance in the shaft axis of the lever plate
1 from the link plate 3 is made shortest, and therefore the
length in the shaft axis of the adjustable nozzle mechanism
is shortened.</p>
    <p num="0053">In accordance with such an embodiment, the coupling hole
1b (stopper surface in hole 1d), formed at one edge side of
the lever plate 1, and the coupling shaft section 02a
(stopper surface on shaft 02b) of the nozzle shaft 02 are
fitted upon setting beforehand the wing angle of the nozzle
vane 2 and the rotating angle of the link plate 3
geometrically in the required relation, and adjustment of the
adjustable nozzle mechanism 100, that is, the position setup
between the wing angle of the nozzle vane 2a and the link
plate 3, is carried out by an extremely easy method such
that, after the edge of the nozzle shaft 02 (coupling shaft
section 02a) is punched at the chamfered portion 01b to be
fixed on the lever plate 1, the fitting pin section 3a of the
link plate 3 is fitted to the slot 1c formed at the other
side of the each lever plate 1.</p>
    <p num="0054">This easy method does not require adjustment of the
adjustable nozzle mechanism 100 during the nozzle assembly 
procedure, in which the perfect closing position should be
adjusted during the nozzle assembly procedure by using the
multiple long slots of the link plate, the stopper pin and
the jigs, as had been required with the invention of Japanese
patent number 3,085,210. Therefore, the assembling man-hours
are decreased, particular assembling facilities such as the
jigs are not needed, and as the result the assembling costs
are decreased.</p>
    <p num="0055">In addition, the adjustable nozzle mechanism 100 is so
composed to join the link plate 3 to the other edge side of
the each lever plate 1 after setting and fixing the
geometrical relation between one edge side of the lever plate
1 and the nozzle shaft 02 as described above, therefore the
structure is simplified comparatively with the technology,
the number of part categories and the parts themselves are
considerably decreased, and part costs are decreased
accordingly.</p>
    <p num="0056">Further, in accordance with such an embodiment,
adjustment of the adjustable nozzle mechanism 100, that is
the position setup between the wing angle of the nozzle vane
2 and the link plate 3 can be carried out by means of joining
the link plate 3 to the other edge of the each lever plate 1
after fitting and fixing upon setting up beforehand the one
edge of the lever plate 1 and the nozzle shaft 02
geometrically so that the wing angle of the nozzle vane 2 and
the rotating angle of the link plate 3 are in the required
relation, variations or error may not occur in the setup for
the perfect closing, which occurred due to the adjustment to
be done with the conventional art for the perfect closing
position during nozzle assembling procedure using the
multiple long slots of the link plate, stopper pin and jigs. 
However, with this invention, the perfect closing position of
the adjustable nozzle mechanism is not determined primarily
by the dimensional accuracy of the component parts, the setup
of the adjustable nozzle mechanism 100 is available while
securing a high degree of accuracy without being influenced
by the dimensional accuracy of the nozzle assembly or the
link assembly, and as a result, the adjustable nozzle
mechanism 100 can be set up to the various requirements.</p>
    <p num="0057">Also, in accordance with such an embodiment, as the
lever plate 1 equal in number to the nozzle vane 2 are placed
between the nozzle mount 4 and the link plate 3 in the
turbine shaft axis, one edge side of the lever plate 1 is
fixed to the nozzle shaft 02 of the nozzle vane 2, the
fitting pin section 3a protruding on the link plate 3 towards
the lever plate side is fitted to the slot provided on the
other edge side of the nozzle plate 1, and punching is
processed so that the punching portion 2a between the lever
plate 1 and the shaft edge of the nozzle shaft 02 does not
squeeze out over the surface of the lever plate 1, the link
plate 3 and the lever plate 1 can be assembled with the
minimum gap, the distance between the link plate 3 and the
nozzle mount 4 having the lever plate 1 sandwiched thereby is
shortened and the length in the shaft axis of the adjustable
nozzle mechanism 100 is shortened as well.</p>
    <p num="0058">Furthermore, as described above, erroneous operation of
the adjustable nozzle mechanism 100 is prevented due to
friction between the protruding part and the link plate 3 as
the possible protrusion of the punched portion 2a of the
nozzle shaft 02 from the side of the link plate is avoided. </p>
    <p num="0059">As mentioned above, according to this invention, In
accordance with this invention, adjustment of the adjustable
nozzle mechanism, that is, the position setup of the wing
angle of the nozzle vane and the nozzle driving member, can
be made in such extremely simple processes. In this process,
the coupling hole provided at one edge of the lever plate and
the coupling shaft at the end of the nozzle shaft are fitted
after being set up geometrically so that the wing angle and
the rotating angle of the link plate composing the nozzle
driving member may be in the predetermined relation. The edge
of the nozzle shaft is then punched into one of the chamfered
portion having a larger diameter (chamfered portion) of the
edge portion in order to be fixed on the lever plate. Then
the lever plate and the link plate can be engaged to each
other by engaging the pins with the slots provided at the
end of the lever plate.</p>
    <p num="0060">With these simplified processes, adjustment of the
adjustable nozzle mechanism during the nozzle assembly
procedure is no longer required and therefore the assembling
man-hours are decreased, particular assembling facilities
such as the jigs are not needed, and as a result, assembling
costs are decreased.</p>
    <p num="0061">Furthermore, as the adjustable nozzle mechanism
according to this invention is configured in the manner that
the one edge side of the joint members and the nozzle shaft
are fixed upon the set geometrical relations between thereto
and the nozzle driving member are joined to the other edge
side of each joint member, the structure is simplified
comparatively with the conventional art and the number of
part category and parts itself are considerably decreased.
Part costs are decreased accordingly. </p>
    <p num="0062">Furthermore, with this invention, configured such that
the nozzle driving member is joined to the other edge of each
joint member after these have been fitted on the condition
that the wing angle of the nozzle vane and the rotating angle
of the nozzle driving member had been set previously in the
geometrical relation as required, and that adjustment of the
adjustable nozzle mechanism, that is, the position setup of
the wing angle of the nozzle vane and the nozzle driving
member is available neither with a setting error that would
arise in the conventional art from the variable setup for the
perfect closing caused by the adjustment for the perfect
closing position during nozzle assembling procedure using the
multiple long slots, the stopper pin and jig, nor the perfect
closing position of the adjustable nozzle mechanism should be
determined primarily by the component parts, the setup herein
of the adjustable nozzle mechanism is available to a high
degree of accuracy without fear of influence by the
dimensional accuracy of the nozzle assembly and thelink
assembly, as well as the enabling of the various requirement
settings of the adjustable nozzle mechanism.</p>
    <p num="0063">Still furthermore, with the configuration mentioned in
claims 5 and 3, configured such that the lever plates equal
in number to the nozzle vanes are placed between the nozzle
mount and the link plate in the turbine shaft axis, that the
one edge of the lever plate is fixed on the nozzle shaft of
the nozzle vane, that the fitting pin protruding toward the
lever plate side in the link plate is fitted into the slots
on the other edge of the lever plate, that the stopper
between the lever plate and the edge of the nozzle shaft is
processed with the use of the chamfered portion in order to
prevent the stopper portion from squeezing out of the side 
face of the lever plate, It becomes possible to assemble the
link plate and lever plate with a minimum distance,
therefore, the distant between the link plate and the nozzle
mount over the lever plate sandwiched thereby becomes
shorter, and the length in the shaft axis of the adjustable
nozzle mechanism is, as a result, shortened.</p>
    <p num="0064">Still furthermore, the punched portion using the
chamfered portion avoids protrusion from the link plate side,
and erroneous operation of the adjustable nozzle mechanism by
the friction and interference between the link plate and the
punched portion is also avoided.</p>
