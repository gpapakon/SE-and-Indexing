    <p>An optical recording film (2) in the form of a monomolecular layer,
includes chemisorptive molecules that are chemically bonded by covalent
bonding to a surface of a substrate (1). The optical recording film (2) has
the property that, when irradiated with polarized light, a long axis
orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is changed to a direction in which
the polarized light is irradiated. A reflective film may be formed on the
substrate (1) surface. For the chemisorptive molecules it is possible to use
CH<sub>3</sub>- COO- C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>- (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>- SiCl<sub>3</sub>, for example. The molecules undergo a
dehydrochlorination with active hydrogen in the base material surface, and
are chemically bonded to the base material surface by covalent bonding.
Thus, an erasable or a write-once optical recording medium of high density
can be provided by chemisorption without necessitating vacuum vapor
deposition to form the recording layer.

    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to an optical recording film, a method
for manufacturing the same, an optical recording medium, an information
recording/reproducing device, a computer system and a video signal
recording/reproducing system.</p>
    <p num="0002">More specifically, the present invention relates to a monomolecular
optical recording film, made by bonding and fixing a cluster of chemisorptive
molecules to the surface of a substrate, on which information can be recorded
by irradiating polarized or unpolarized light to change the long-axis direction
of the chemisorptive molecules, as well as a method for manufacturing the
same, an optical recording medium, an information recording/reproducing
device, a computer system and a video signal recording/reproducing system.</p>
    <p num="0003">In recent years, the amount of electronic information has risen
dramatically, and there is a need for the development of low-cost
high-capacity recording media. In particular, low-cost erasable recording
media are in high demand as auxiliary storage media for computers.
However, all the technologies that are currently used for high-capacity
erasable recording media are based on magnetic recording, optical recording
or optomagnetic recording, and all use vacuum vapor deposition to form the
recording layer, so that there is the problem of high manufacturing costs.</p>
    <p num="0004">It is thus an object of the present invention to provide low-cost optical
recording media by developing an erasable optical recording medium and a
write-once optical recording medium that can be manufactured by a process
not requiring vacuum vapor deposition for the formation of the recording
layer, and on which information can be recorded at high densities. It is
another object of the present invention to provide an information
recording/reproducing device for the recording and reproducing of
information on this optical recording medium, as well as a computer system
and a video information recording/reproducing system provided with the
optical recording medium and an information recording/reproducing device.</p>
    <p num="0005">To achieve these objects, an optical recording film in accordance with
the present invention is an optical recording film in form of a monomolecular
layer, comprising chemisorptive molecules that are chemically bonded by 
covalent bonding to a surface of a substrate, wherein the optical recording
film has the property that, when irradiated with polarized light, a long axis
orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is changed to a direction in which
the polarized light is irradiated. The molecules in the monomolecular layer
may independent from one another or they may be linked to one another by
crosslinking or polymerization.</p>
    <p num="0006">A method for manufacturing an optical recording film in accordance
with the present invention includes: providing a substrate including active
hydrogen at its surface, providing a chemisorptive solution, by mixing in a
non-aqueous organic solvent chemisorptive molecules having at one end a
reactive group that chemically bonds with the active hydrogen at the surface
of the substrate, and having the property that, when irradiated with
polarized light for molecule orientation, a long axis orientation of the
chemisorptive molecules is changed into a specific direction depending on a
polarization direction of the polarized light; and forming the optical
recording film in form of a monomolecular layer chemically bonded to the
surface of the substrate by bringing the chemisorptive solution and the
substrate into contact and causing a low molecular elimination reaction
between the active hydrogen in the substrate surface and the reactive groups
of the chemisorptive molecules. Herein, "low molecular elimination
reaction" refers to a dehydrohalogenation reaction, a dealcoholization
reaction (wherein the alcohol has a carbon number of 1 to 3) or a
deisocyanation reaction.</p>

    <p num="0047">The present invention provides an erasable optical recording film
with which information can be recorded in an erasable manner by changing
the long-axis orientation of chemisorptive molecules constituting this optical 
recording film. With polarized orientation light, it is possible to record on
this optical recording film information indicating that polarized orientation
light has been irradiated, or information indicating the place where the
polarized orientation light has been irradiated, or the polarization direction
of the irradiated polarized light. Moreover, controlling the long-axis
orientation of the chemisorptive molecules by irradiating the optical
recording film systematically with polarized orientation light makes it
possible to record information representing characters or graphics or
digitized information.</p>
    <p num="0048">When irradiated with polarized orientation light, the chemisorptive
molecule group constituting the optical recording film has a characteristic
orientation direction, and it seems that this orientation direction depends on
the molecular structure of the chemisorptive molecules and the film
structure of the optical recording film. In general, this orientation direction
defines a certain angle with the propagation direction of the polarization
direction of the polarized orientation light within the plane formed by the
polarization direction and the propagation direction of the polarized
orientation light. For the chemisorptive molecules used in the present
invention, it is also possible to use molecules that are not oriented within the
plane formed by the polarization direction and the propagation direction of
the polarized orientation light.</p>
    <p num="0049">Throughout this specification, "light" means polarized or unpolarized
light. "Polarized light" means completely linearly polarized light,
completely elliptically polarized light with high ellipticity, or partially
polarized light with a high degree of polarization (polarization ratio)
including completely linearly polarized light or completely elliptically
polarized light with high ellipticity. "Unpolarized light" means completely
unpolarized light or partially polarized light with a low polarization ratio
including linearly polarized light or elliptically polarized light.</p>
    <p num="0050">Throughout this specification, "polarization direction" means, in the
case of completely linearly polarized light or partially polarized light with a
high polarization degree including linearly polarized light with a high
polarization degree (also referred to inclusively as "linear polarized light),
the direction of the line of intersection between the plane perpendicular to
the propagation direction (forward direction) of that light and the oscillation
plane of the E-vector of the completely linearly polarized light. In the case
of elliptically polarized light and partially polarized light including 
completely elliptically polarized light, "polarization direction" means the
direction of the major elliptical axis (long axis direction) given by the
E-vector of the completely elliptically polarized light projected onto the plane
perpendicular to the propagation direction.</p>
    <p num="0051">The present invention provides an erasable optical recording film on
which information can be recorded by changing the long axis direction of the
chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film. On this
optical recording film, it is possible to record information indicating that
polarized orientation light or unpolarized light absorbed by the
chemisorptive molecules has been irradiated, or information indicating the
place where the polarized orientation light or unpolarized light has been
irradiated, or the polarization direction of the irradiated polarized light.
Moreover, controlling the long-axis orientation of the chemisorptive
molecules by irradiating the optical recording film systematically with
polarized orientation light or unpolarized light makes it possible to record
information representing characters or graphics or digitized information.</p>
    <p num="0052">The optical recording molecules of the present invention are
straight-chained linear polymers, so that they have a large dipole moment
within the chemisorptive molecules, and information can be recorded and
reproduced with high sensitivity. Furthermore, since the spatial spread of
the substrate plane of the chemisorptive molecules and the horizontal
direction is small, a monomolecular recording film with a high molecule
density is achieved.</p>
    <p num="0053">If the chemisorptive molecules constituting the erasable optical
recording film include an optically absorbing functional group that absorbs
light of a certain wavelength, then the long axis orientation of the
chemisorptive molecules can be oriented using light of a wavelength that is
absorbed by the optically absorbing functional group. Also, the irradiation
energy necessary to change the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive
molecules to a random orientation can be reduced. The necessary
irradiation energy can be further reduced using light near the absorption
peak wavelength in the optical absorption spectrum of the optically
absorbing functional group.</p>
    <p num="0054">If the optically absorbing functional group in the erasable optical
recording film is a UV light absorbing functional group that absorbs light of
a wavelength in the UV region, then an erasable optical recording film with
recording permanency can be provided, in which the writing efficiency is 
high, and the orientation state is not easily lost even after repeated
reproductions. Furthermore, the possibility that UV light is irradiated onto
the optical recording medium during indoor use and storage is low, so that
convenient handling is possible.</p>
    <p num="0055">If the UV light absorbing functional group in the erasable optical
recording film is an aryl backbone group, an arylene backbone group or a
carbonyl group, then information can be recorded with light of a low energy

    <p num="0056">If, in an optical recording film of monomolecular form including a
cluster of chemisorptive molecules having the above-described photoreactive
functional group, which is chemically bonded to the surface of a substrate,
the optical recording film further has the property that, when irradiated
with polarized reaction light causing a reaction with the photoreactive
functional group, the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules
changes to a specific direction determined by the polarization direction and
the propagation direction of the polarized reaction light, and the long axis
direction of the chemisorptive molecules is fixed, then a write-once optical
recording medium recording information by changing the long axis direction
of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film can be
achieved. The long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules that are
chemically reacted by irradiation with the polarized reaction light is
permanent, and cannot be reverted to its original state. Consequently, a
write-once optical recording medium with superior recording permanency is
achieved.</p>
    <p num="0057">In this write-once optical recording film, the photoreactive functional
group is a photopolymerizable functional group, and, when irradiated with
the polarized reaction light, the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive
molecules constituting the optical recording film is oriented in the specific
direction and the specific direction is fixed by polymerizing or crosslinking
the chemisorptive molecules with one another. That is to say, a write-once
optical recording film is achieved, in which the long axis orientation of the
chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film can be fixed
by irradiation of polarized reaction light.</p>
    <p num="0058">If, in this write-once optical recording film, the photopolymerizable
functional group is a UV polymerizable functional group that reacts under
light of a wavelength in the UV region, then the long axis orientation of the
chemisorptive molecules does not change even when after repeated 
reproduction, and an erasable optical recording film with high recording
permanency can be provided. Furthermore, the possibility that UV light is
irradiated onto the optical recording film during indoor use and storage is
low, so that convenient handling is possible.</p>
    <p num="0059">If, in this write-once optical recording film, the UV polymerizable
functional group is a chalcone backbone group, a cinnamate backbone group
or a diacetylene backbone group, then an optical recording can be carried out
using polarized reaction light of low energy density, and a write-once optical
recording film allowing optical recordings with high permanency is achieved.</p>
    <p num="0060">By forming the optical recording film directly on the substrate
surface, a low-cost optical recording film can be formed.</p>
    <p num="0061">If the base material for the optical recording film is ceramic, glass or
a synthetic resin, then an optical recording film that shows great stability
can be provided. Furthermore, it can be handled easily and is thus suitable
for many applications.</p>
    <p num="0062">If the substrate is made of a base material and a primer layer coating
formed on the substrate, and the optical recording film is formed on a surface
of the primer layer coating, then the optical recording film can be formed on
any base material, which increases the degree of freedom with which the
base material can be selected.</p>
    <p num="0063">With the above-described method, an erasable optical recording film
can be manufactured that records information in an erasable manner using
polarized orientation light, and the chemisorptive molecules easily can be
chemically bonded to the substrate surface. This film is an erasable optical
recording film with high resistance against exfoliation.</p>
    <p num="0064">If in the above-described method the chemisorptive molecules include
an optically absorbing functional group that absorbs light of a certain
wavelength, then an optical recording medium can be manufactured that
allows recording with light of a low energy density.</p>
    <p num="0065">If in the above-described method the optically absorbing functional

    <p num="0066">If in the above-described method chemisorptive molecules are used
that have an aryl backbone group, an arylene backbone group or a carbonyl

    <p num="0067">Furthermore, since the optical recording film can be oriented with
polarized orientation light, the optical recording film can be initialized to
various states, thus expanding its scope of utility.</p>
    <p num="0068">If in the above-described method the photoreactive functional groups
in the chemisorptive molecules are polymerizable functional groups, then an
optical recording film can be manufactured in which irradiation with
polarized reaction light can orient the long axis orientation of the
chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film in a specific
direction and fix the orientation by polymerization or crosslinking.</p>
    <p num="0069">If in the above-described method the photopolymerizable functional

    <p num="0070">If in the above-described method the UV polymerizable functional

    <p num="0071">In the chemisorptive solution preparation step of the above-described
method, there may be 1 to 3 functional groups to be chemically bonded. Si
has four bonding sites, so that there may be 1 to 3 functional groups reacting
with the active hydrogen of the surface of the base material, and 1 to 3
optically absorbing functional groups.</p>
    <p num="0072">However, the functional group X that reacts with the active hydrogen
of the surface of the base material is generally a halogen atom, an alkoxyl
group or an isocyanate group. If the functional group X is an alkoxyl group,
then a dealcoholization reaction with the active hydrogen of the surface of
the base material occurs. If the functional group X is a halogen atom, then
a dehydrohalogenation reaction with the active hydrogen of the surface of
the base material occurs. If the functional group X is an isocyanate group,
then a deisocyanation reaction with the active hydrogen of the surface of the
base material occurs. Such thin films that are covalently bonded by a low
molecular elimination reaction to the surface of the base material are also
known as chemisorptive films or "self-assembling films" to the person skilled 
in the art. In this specification, they are referred to as "chemisorptive
films."</p>
    <p num="0073">A non-aqueous organic solvent is used in the chemisorptive solution
preparation step of the above-described method. Thus, it is possible to
prevent the hydrolysis of the chemisorptive molecules.</p>
    <p num="0074">In the above-described method, it is preferable that, after the
recording layer formation step, non-adsorbed chemisorptive molecules are
rinsed away by immersion in a non-aqueous organic solvent. Thus, a
monomolecular film with an unblemished surface can be formed, diffused
reflections at the optical recording film surface can be reduced, and an
optical recording film with high writing and reading precision can be formed.</p>
    <p num="0075">In the above-described method, it is also possible to introduce or
supply functional groups including active hydrogen to the substrate surface
before the recording layer formation step. Thus, if there is no or insufficient
active hydrogen at the surface of the base material, then an optical recording
film easily can be fabricated by first introducing or supplying functional
groups including active hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="0076">In a pretreatment step of this method, the surface of the substrate
can be subjected to a plasma treatment, a corona treatment, an electron
beam treatment or a UV light treatment. Thus, it is possible to introduce
functional groups including active hydrogen to the substrate surface.</p>
    <p num="0077">In the recording-layer formation step of the above-described method,
it is possible to use as the substrate a base material with active hydrogen
that includes functional groups having active hydrogen at the base material
surface, and to form the optical recording film on the surface of this base
material with active hydrogen. Thus, the chemisorptive molecules can be
chemisorbed to the medium substrate. Moreover, an organic thin film is
formed directly on the base material surface, so that the manufacturing
process is simplified.</p>
    <p num="0078">In the recording layer formation step of the above-described method,
it is also possible to use as the substrate a coated base material in which a
coating having functional groups including active hydrogen is provided on
any base material, and to form the optical recording film on the coating
surface. Thus, the optical recording film can be manufactured regardless of
the material of the material quality of the base material, and the degree of
freedom with which the base material can be selected is increased.</p>

Moreover, it is possible to record information representing characters or

medium substrate.</p>
    <p num="0082">Throughout this specification, "information recording unit region"
means a region in the recording layer that records one information element.
Consequently, if the recording layer is formed only in the information
recording unit regions, the information recording unit regions can be
recognized. Otherwise, for example if the recording layer is formed across
the entire surface of the medium substrate and the entire surface is in the
same orientation state, the information recording unit regions cannot be
recognized, so that the information recording unit regions are virtual regions
into which information elements are written.</p>
    <p num="0083">Throughout this specification, "information element" refers to the
structural elements of the information units when the information has been
broken down to its minimal units. More specifically, in conventional binary
representations, in which the information units are single bits of information
expressed by "0"s and "1"s, those "0"s and "1"s are the information elements.
Consequently, any information can be represented by a string of information
elements. In accordance with the present invention, not only binary

spiral shape on the medium substrate, then an optical recording medium is
attained that can be read easily and quickly. </p>
    <p num="0096">If the medium substrate of the optical recording medium is a
tape-shaped or a card-shaped medium substrate, and the information
recording unit regions in the recording layer are arranged in parallel linear
groups intersecting at a predetermined angle with a longitudinal direction of
the medium substrate, then recording at high densities becomes possible.
Furthermore, the mechanism for the recording is also simplified.</p>
    <p num="0097">If all information recording unit regions of the recording layer in the
optical recording medium are initialized to become oriented regions in which
the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is oriented, then an
optical recording medium is provided that can be adapted to various
applications. Furthermore, the possibility of malfunctioning during the
recording or reproducing also can be reduced.</p>

    </heading>
    <p num="0102">Embodiment 1 explains an erasable optical recording film ("erasable"
films are also called "rewritable" films) in terms of its manufacturing
method.</p>
    <p num="0103">Fig. 1 shows a cross-section, magnified to the molecular level, of an
optical recording film 2 according to Embodiment 1. Fig. 2 shows a
schematic diagram illustrating an immersion method as an example of a
recording film formation step. Fig. 2 shows how a substrate in which an
optically reflective film 5 has been formed on a base material 1 is immersed
in a chemisorptive solution 34.</p>
    <p num="0104">For the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer of
the erasable optical recording medium, it is possible to use chemisorptive
molecules having the property to be oriented by polarized light such that
when irradiated with polarized orientation light, they are oriented in a
characteristic direction determined by the polarization direction and the
propagation direction of the polarized orientation light, or chemisorptive
molecules that, when irradiated with polarized orientation light, are
oriented in a certain direction determined by the polarization direction of the
polarized light and its propagation direction, and when irradiated with
unpolarized light, are oriented in random directions without specific
orientation. Chemisorptive molecules having the property to be oriented by
polarized light usually have the property to be oriented in random directions
when irradiated with unpolarized light, but it is also possible to use
molecules not having that property.</p>
    <p num="0105">When the chemisorptive molecules have at one end a functional
group forming a chemical bond with active hydrogen, then it is easy to form a
recording film in the form of a chemically bonded monomolecular film.
Metal base materials, ceramic base materials and glass base materials, 
which are typically used, have functional groups including active hydrogen
at their topmost surface, so that using such base materials, there is no need
for a special treatment of the base material. The functional group including
active hydrogen at the base material surface can be for example -OH,
-COOH, -CHO, -NH<sub>2</sub> or &gt;NH.</p>
    <p num="0106">For the chemisorptive molecules having a functional group that
chemically reacts with active hydrogen as described above, it is possible to
use a silane-based surface active agent. For example, it is possible to use a
trihalogenosilane surface active agent, a dihalogenosilane surface active
agent, a monohalogenosilane surface active agent, a trialkoxysilane surface
active agent, a dialkoxysilane surface active agent, a monoalkoxysilane
surface active agent, a triisocyanatosilane surface active agent, a
diisocyanatosilane surface active agent or a monoisocyanatosilane surface
active agent.</p>
    <p num="0107">Furthermore, when the chemisorptive molecules include a functional
group that absorbs light, then it is possible to change the long axis
orientation of the chemisorptive molecules with little irradiation energy.
Thus, the power consumption can be reduced, and the time necessary for
recording can be shortened. If light is used for reading out, then the writing
efficiency and precision as well as the precision with which recordings are
maintained increases the larger the difference between the wavelength of
the light used for reading and the wavelength of the light used for writing is,
so that UV-light absorbing functional groups (i.e., functional groups that
absorb light of wavelengths in the UV region) are preferable.</p>
    <p num="0108">As such UV-light absorbing functional groups, it is possible to use
chemisorptive molecules including an aryl backbone group, an arylene
backbone group or a carbonyl group. Here, "aryl backbone group" means a
group of atoms forming the backbone of an aryl molecule. Consequently, it
can be a monovalent characteristic group or a divalent characteristic group.</p>
    <p num="0109">The molecular structure of the chemisorptive molecules can be
somewhat branched, as long as this does not impede the variability of the
long axis of the chemisorptive molecules, but it is preferable that they are
linear molecules with as few branched chains as possible. With such
chemisorptive molecules, the dipole moment in the molecules is large, and
the spatial obstruction caused by neighboring chemisorptive molecules when
changing the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is small,
thus improving the responsiveness to light as well as the writing sensitivity 
and precision. Furthermore, in random regions, in which the long axes of
the chemisorptive molecules are random, the optical transmissivity is
particularly isotropic, whereas in oriented regions, in which the long axes of
the chemisorptive molecules are oriented, the optical transmissivity is
particularly anisotropic, increasing the reading precision. Furthermore,
because the spatial obstruction is small, an optical recording film with a high
density of chemisorptive molecules can be formed, which also improves the
reading precision.</p>
    <p num="0110">The linear molecules are preferably molecules having, excluding the
functional group bonding with active hydrogen, a straight-chain carbon
backbone (referred to as "straight-chain backbone molecules" in the
following), molecules having a linear backbone in which some of the carbon
atoms have been replaced with a group of atoms (referred to as "linear
backbone molecules" in the following) such as a phenyl group (-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-), a
carbonyl group (-CO-), or an oxycarbonyl group (-CO-O-), or straight-chain
backbone molecules or linear backbone molecules including substitution
groups such as halogen atoms, carbon trifluoride (CF<sub>3</sub>-), alkyl or alkylene
groups with a carbon number of 1 to 25, or phenyl groups (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-).</p>
    <p num="0111">For the organic solvent in the chemisorptive solution preparation
step, a non-aqueous organic solvent is used. Using a non-aqueous organic
solvent, a monomolecular optical recording film with a very uniform film
thickness can be formed.</p>
    <p num="0112">As a method for bringing the substrate and the chemisorptive
solution into contact during the recording film formation step, it is possible
to apply the chemisorptive solution to the substrate or to immerse the
substrate in the chemisorptive solution. It is preferable that this step is
performed in a dry atmosphere of not more than 30% relative humidity, such
as in dry air, dry nitrogen or dry helium.</p>
    <p num="0113">Using a base material having functional groups including active
hydrogen makes the manufacturing of the optical recording film easy. In
particular, if a metal base material, ceramic base material or glass base
material that already has been in contact with air is used, then it will have a
sufficient amount of active hydrogen for the formation of the optical
recording film at its surface even without subjecting it to a special surface
treatment. If a metal base material is used, then the surface oxidizes
naturally when it is exposed to air including a water component, and the
oxide formed by this natural oxidation further reacts with water molecules, 
introducing functional groups with active hydrogen, and mainly hydroxyl
groups. Also in ceramic base materials and glass base materials, the atoms
of the substrate surface react with the water molecules in air, introducing
functional groups including active hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="0114">In general, base materials with a hydrophilic surface include many
hydroxyl groups, and the hydrogen atoms included in these hydroxyl groups
are active hydrogen. Consequently, using hydrophilic substrates makes it
easy to manufacture the optical recording film.</p>
    <p num="0115">In the case of a synthetic resin substrate, functional groups including
active hydrogen easily can be introduced for example by subjecting the
surface to a plasma treatment, a corona treatment or a UV-light treatment.
Consequently, the optical recording film also can be manufactured on a
synthetic resin base material into which active hydrogen has been
introduced. With a synthetic resin substrate having functional groups
including active hydrogen at its surface, the optical recording film can be
manufactured without performing the above-noted treatments.</p>
    <p num="0116">In the case of metal base materials, ceramic base materials and glass
base materials that do not have or do not have sufficient active hydrogen at
their surface, it is possible to introduce functional groups including active
hydrogen by subjecting the surface to a plasma treatment, a corona
treatment or a UV-light treatment.</p>
    <p num="0117">If the chemisorptive molecules cannot be chemisorbed directly to the
surface, or if the surface cannot be easily modified by subjecting it to surface
processing, then the surface may be coated with a coating having functional
groups including active hydrogen at its surface. Thus, the optical recording
film can be formed on any base material, so that the base material can be
selected from a broader range.</p>
    <p num="0118">It is preferable that after the recording film formation step,
unreacted chemisorptive molecules remaining on the substrate are rinsed
away. Performing such a rinsing step, a monomolecular film with an
unblemished surface can be formed, and an optical recording film with high
writing precision and reading precision can be formed. Furthermore, for
the organic solvent in the rinsing step, a non-aqueous organic solvent is
used.</p>

      <i>Embodiment 2</i>
    </heading>
    <p num="0119">A write-once optical recording film can be manufactured in the same 
manner as in Embodiment 1, except that chemisorptive molecules including
photoreactive functional groups are used for the chemisorptive molecules
constituting the optical recording film.</p>
    <p num="0120">Chemisorptive molecules including photo-polymerizable functional
groups can be used for the photoreactive functional groups. If the
photoreactive functional groups are photo-polymerizable groups, then a
permanent orientation direction can be attained by orienting the
chemisorptive molecules in a characteristic orientation by irradiating
polarized light for the purpose of reaction, and polymerizing or crosslinking
the chemisorptive molecules constituting the optical recording film to one
another. Here, photopolymerization also includes thermal polymerization
caused by optical absorption.</p>
    <p num="0121">The larger the difference between the wavelength of the reference
light for reading and the wavelength of the polarized reaction light is, the
higher is the writing precision and the precision with which recordings are
maintained, so that functional groups that are reacted by UV light are
preferable as photoreactive functional groups. In order to improve the
writing efficiency, it is even more preferable to use light of a wavelength near
the absorption peak wavelength to cause a reaction of the photoreactive
functional groups.</p>
    <p num="0122">For the chemisorptive molecules having functional groups that can
be polymerized by light of a wavelength in the UV region, it is possible to use
chemisorptive molecules having a chalcone backbone group, a cinnamate
backbone group or an acetylene backbone group.</p>
    <p num="0123">In write-once optical recording films, the ability to hold recordings
and the permanency with respect to repeated reproduction is given the most
weight, so that chemisorptive molecules whose long axis orientation changes
upon irradiation with light can be used as the chemisorptive molecules
constituting the optical recording film, even when their responsiveness to
irradiation with light is low. Furthermore, in order to improve the
recording speed, it is preferable that the chemisorptive molecules have as
few branched chains as possible. Such molecules have a large dipole
moment, which improves the responsiveness to light and enhances the
anisotropy of the optical transmissivity, thus improving the writing
sensitivity and precision as well as the reading precision. Preferably, the
chemisorptive molecules are straight-chain backbone molecules or linear
backbone molecules or are straight-chain backbone molecules or linear 
backbone molecules having substitution groups, as in Embodiment 1.</p>
    <p num="0124">The chemisorptive molecules may be molecules having photoreactive
functional groups and, at one end, functional groups that chemically bond
with the substrate. If the functional groups that chemically bond with the
substrate have at their end a functional group that reacts with active
hydrogen, then an optical recording film in the form of a chemically bonded
monomolecular film can be formed. It is possible to use a silane-based
surface active agent having a photoreactive functional group for these
molecules. For the silane-based surface active agent, it is possible to use a
chlorosilane-based surface active agent, an alkoxysilane-based surface active
agent, or an isocyanate-based surface active agent, as in Embodiment 1.</p>
    <heading>
      <i>Embodiment 3</i>
    </heading>
    <p num="0125">This embodiment illustrates an erasable optical recording medium
whose medium substrate surface is provided with the erasable optical
recording film of Embodiment 1 as the recording layer.</p>
    <p num="0126">An erasable optical recording medium is manufactured in the same
manner as in Embodiment 1, except that an optically reflective medium
substrate or an optically transparent medium substrate is used instead of
the substrate used in Embodiment 1. If the chemisorptive molecules have
at one end a functional group that reacts with active hydrogen, then it is
easy to form such a chemically bonded monomolecular recording layer. For
such chemisorptive molecules, it is possible to use a silane-based surface
active agent, such as a chlorosilane-based surface active agent, an
alkoxysilane-based surface active agent, or an isocyanatosilane-based
surface active agent.</p>
    <p num="0127">It is preferable that the chemisorptive molecules include optically
absorbing functional groups, and it is even more preferable that they have
functional groups absorbing UV light. As such chemisorptive molecules, it
is possible to use molecules including an aryl backbone group, an arylene
backbone group or a carbonyl group.</p>
    <p num="0128">The chemisorptive molecules may have some branched chains, as
long as this does not compromise their ability to be oriented, but it is
preferable that they have as few branched chains as possible. It is even
more preferable to use straight-chain backbone molecules, linear backbone
molecules or straight-chain backbone molecules or linear backbone
molecules having substitution groups, as described in Embodiment 1 </p>
    <p num="0129">As in Embodiment 1, a non-aqueous organic solvent is used as the
organic solvent in the chemisorptive solution preparation step.
Furthermore, a rinsing step for rinsing away the unreacted chemisorptive
molecules remaining on the medium substrate is carried out after the
recording film formation step. A non-aqueous organic solvent is used for the
organic solvent in the rinsing step.</p>
    <p num="0130">As a method for bringing the medium substrate and the
chemisorptive solution into contact during the recording layer formation step,
it is possible to apply the chemisorptive solution to the substrate, or to
immerse the substrate in the chemisorptive solution. When forming a
recording layer on both sides of the medium substrate, it is preferable to use
immersion in the chemisorptive solution. With this method, the recording
layer can be formed simultaneously on the front and the rear side of the
medium substrate.</p>
    <p num="0131">The following is an explanation of the structure of the optical
recording medium, with reference to Figs. 3A to E and Figs. 4A to C.</p>
    <p num="0132">Figs. 3A to E are cross-sectional views illustrating examples of the
structure of an optical recording medium in which an optical recording layer
2 is provided on an optically reflective medium substrate 3. Fig. 3A shows
an optical recording medium in which the optical recording layer 2 is formed
directly on the surface of an optically reflective base material 21. Fig. 3B
shows an optical recording medium in which an optically reflective film 5 is
formed on a base material 1, and the optical recording layer 2 is formed on
top of the optically reflective film 5. Fig. 3C shows an optical recording
medium in which an optically reflective film 5 and an optically transmissive
coating 4 are formed on the base material 1, and the optical recording layer 2
is formed on top of that. Fig. 3D shows an optical recording medium in
which an optically reflective film 5 is formed on the base material 1, and an
optical recording layer 2 is formed partially on top of the optically reflective
film 5. Fig. 3E shows an optical recording medium in which optically
reflective films 5 are formed on both sides of the base material 1, and optical
recording layers 2 are formed on the optically reflective films 5.</p>
    <p num="0133">Figs. 4A to C are cross-sectional views illustrating examples of the
structure of an optical recording medium in which an optical recording layer
2 is provided on an optically transmissive medium substrate 3. Fig. 4A
shows an optical recording medium in which the optical recording layer 2 is
formed directly on the surface of an optically transmissive base material 11. 
Fig. 4B shows an optical recording medium in which an optically
transmissive coating 4 is formed on a base material 11, and the optical
recording layer 2 is formed on top of the optically transmissive coating 4.
Fig. 4C shows an optical recording medium in which the optical recording
layer 2 is partially formed directly on the optical transmissive base material
11.</p>
    <p num="0134">As for the shape, it is preferable that the medium substrate is
disk-shaped, tape-shaped or card-shaped. For disk-shaped or card-shaped
medium substrates, base materials with high rigidity, such as metal, ceramic
or glass base materials can be utilized. For tape-shaped medium substrates,
base materials with high flexibility, such as synthetic resin base materials
can be utilized.</p>
    <p num="0135">Furthermore, depending on whether the method for reading the
recorded information is for transmissive medium substrates or reflective
medium substrates, medium substrates can be broadly classified into
optically transmissive medium substrates and optically reflective medium
substrates.</p>
    <p num="0136">For optically transmissive medium substrates 3, an optically
transmissive base material 11, for example a glass base material, is used,
and the recording layer 2 is formed on the surface of the optically
transmissive base material 11 (see Fig. 4A). Alternatively, it is also possible
to form an optically transmissive coating 4 made of an optically transmissive
substance group on top of the optically transmissive base material 11, and to
form the recording layer 2 on the surface of the optically transmissive
coating 4 (see Fig. 4B). If the recording layer 2 is formed via an optically
transmissive coating 4 in this manner, the substrate can be selected from a
broader range. Alternatively, it is also possible to form the recording film 2
only at predetermined locations on the surface of the medium substrate 3,
forming information recording unit regions (see Fig. 4C).</p>
    <p num="0137">A reflective optical recording medium can be manufactured using a
medium substrate 3 provided with an optically reflective film 5 made of an
optically reflective substance group on any base material 1 as the optically
reflective medium substrate 3, and forming the recording film 2 on the
surface of the optically reflective medium substrate 3 (see Fig. 3B). It is
preferable that the optically reflective film has a high reflectance, and
examples of suitable materials for such an optically reflective film 5 are
materials mainly including metallic aluminum or silver. Furthermore, if a 
material with high smoothness is used, an optically reflective film 5 that has
uniform film thickness and even surface can be formed. An example of
materials with high optical reflectance and smoothness is metallic aluminum
including several percent by weight of silicon.</p>
    <p num="0138">Furthermore, using an optically reflective base material 21 made of
an optically reflective substance group, it is possible to manufacture an
optically reflective optical recording medium provided with a monomolecular
recording optical layer 2 provided on the surface of the optically reflective
base material 21 (see Fig. 3A). It is also possible to form the recording layer
2 only at predetermined locations of the optically reflective medium
substrate 3, and form information recording unit regions (see Fig. 3D).</p>
    <p num="0139">It is also possible to form the recording layer 2 on an optically
reflective film 5 or an optically reflective base material 21, with an optically
transmissive coating 4 disposed therebetween. With this configuration, an
optical recording medium provided with an optically reflective film that is
highly resistant against for example exfoliation can be attained.</p>
    <p num="0140">It is preferable that after the recording layer formation step, the long
axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording
layer is initialized to a certain direction by irradiating the optical recording
medium with orientation light (polarized orientation light or unpolarized
orientation light). The following is an explanation of the initialization of an
erasable optical recording medium. First, it will be explained with
reference to Fig. 5 to Figs. 7A - C how the entire recording layer can be
initialized. Then, it will be explained how at least a partial region of the
recording layer including information recording unit regions can be
initialized.</p>
    <p num="0141">After the recording layer formation step, the long axis orientations of
the chemisorptive molecules in the recording layer are in a random state
(random regions), and no particular initialization is necessary to take this
random state as the initial state. However, when oriented information
recording unit regions that are oriented in a specified orientation are formed,
then there is the possibility of malfunctioning during usage, so that in the
case of an optical recording medium having a recording layer that is changed
into a random state by irradiation with unpolarized light, it is preferable
that the entire recording layer is irradiated with unpolarized light to ensure
a random state.</p>
    <p num="0142">To initialize the entire recording layer to an oriented state, it is 
possible to perform bulk irradiation or scanning irradiation of the entire
surface of the recording layer 2 with polarized orientation light, thus
orienting the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording film 2 in a
predetermined orientation (orienting by polarized light), but it is also
possible to orient them into a predetermined orientation by rubbing the
recording layer 2 with a rubbing roll 31 (orienting by rubbing). Fig. 5 shows
a schematic diagram illustrating methods for orientation by (polarized) light.
Figs. 7A to 7C are schematic diagrams illustrating a method for orientation
by rubbing. Fig. 7A shows a method for rubbing the medium substrate in one
direction. Fig. 7B shows a method for rubbing the medium substrate 3 in a
circumferential direction. Fig. 7C shows a method for rubbing the medium
substrate 3 at a uniform rubbing density in a circumferential direction (that
is, a direction vertical to the radius). In Fig. 7C, it is possible to rub with a
uniform rubbing density by appropriately selecting the length of the disk
radius r<sub>1</sub> and the radius r<sub>2</sub> of the rubbing roll.</p>
    <p num="0143">Furthermore, it is also possible to orient the long axis orientation of
the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer 2 by lifting the
surface of the medium substrate 3 at a certain angle, preferably a right angle,
with respect to the surface of the organic solvent 32 when retrieving the
medium substrate 3 from the organic solvent 32 in the recording layer
formation step, or, if a rinsing step is performed, in the rinsing step
(orienting by draining a solution). Fig. 6 is a schematic diagram illustrating
a method for orientation by draining a solution.</p>
    <p num="0144">It is possible to initialize the recording layer (to form orientation
regions) with high precision to a uniaxially oriented orientation state by
further applying polarized light after orienting by draining a solution and/or
by rubbing. It is preferable to initialize the recording layer by orienting
with polarized light after orienting by draining a solution. This way of
initialization is superior in that there is no possibility of damaging the
surface of the substrate medium as by rubbing, and in that can simplify the
process. As described above, by using an orientation state in which the long
axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules has been uniaxially oriented
as information elements or structural elements of information elements, it is
possible to write and read information with high precision.</p>
    <p num="0145">Next, it is also possible to initialize to an arbitrary or predetermined
orientation state of the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules
included in the information recording unit regions by irradiating polarized 
orientation light on each information recording unit region (formation of
arbitrary oriented regions or predetermined oriented regions). In the case
of an optical recording medium having the property that the long axis
orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is changed into random
orientations by irradiation with unpolarized light, it is also possible to
initialize the information recording unit regions to a random state by
irradiating unpolarized orientation light on each information recording unit
region (forming random regions).</p>
    <p num="0146">The following explanation is for the case of initializing a disk-shaped
optical recording medium, a tape-shaped optical recording medium or a
card-shaped optical recording medium in this manner. However, the case of
initializing to a random state the information recording unit regions of an
optical recording medium having the property that the long axis orientation
of the chemisorptive molecules is changed into random orientations by
irradiating unpolarized light has been omitted. If need be, "polarized
orientation light" may be replaced by "unpolarized orientation light" and
"orientation state" by "arbitrary orientation state," and "predetermined
orientation state" by "random state."</p>
    <p num="0147">In the case of a disk-shaped recording medium, the information
recording unit regions may be arranged in concentric circles as shown in Fig.
8A or in a spiral shape as shown in Fig. 8B. In this case, the information
recording unit regions can be initialized in a predetermined orientation state
by rotating the disk-shaped optical recording medium and shifting polarized
orientation light with fixed polarization direction and propagation direction
in the radial direction.</p>
    <p num="0148">It is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions
into an arbitrary orientation state at once without rotating the disk-shaped
optical recording medium by preparing a photo-mask provided with a
predetermined pattern and irradiating polarized orientation light with fixed
polarization direction and propagation direction through the photo-mask
onto the recording layer. Furthermore, it is also possible to initialize all
information recording unit regions into an arbitrary orientation state at once
by forming a photo-mask on or below a polarizer, irradiating unpolarized
orientation light through the polarizer, and irradiating the recording layer
with the polarized orientation light of a predetermined pattern that has
passed through the polarizer.</p>
    <p num="0149">Figs. 9A and 9B are schematic perspective views illustrating a 
method for partially initializing the recording layer 2. Fig. 9A shows a
method for initialization with a polarizer 7 provided with a photo-mask 33 of
a predetermined pattern, and Fig. 9B shows a method for initialization by
successively changing the location irradiated with light.</p>
    <p num="0150">For the initialization of a disk-shaped optical recording medium, it is
possible to irradiate orientation light intermittently onto each information
recording unit region, or to successively irradiate the orientation light
continuously onto the information recording unit regions. In this case it is
preferable to rotate the disk-shaped optical recording medium continuously.
Furthermore, it is preferable to irradiate the medium substrate with
unpolarized orientation light or polarized orientation light from a direction
substantially perpendicular to the disk-shaped medium substrate surface.</p>
    <p num="0151">Figs. 10A to 10C are schematic plan views showing initialization
examples for disk-shaped optical recording media. Fig. 10A shows a
recording layer 2 that has been partially initialized in a predetermined
orientation state. Fig. 10B shows a recording layer 2 that has been
completely initialized in an arbitrary orientation state. Fig. 10C shows a
recording layer 2 that has been completely initialized in a predetermined
orientation state.</p>
    <p num="0152">In the case of a tape-shaped optical recording medium or a
card-shaped optical recording medium, it is preferable that the information
recording unit regions are arranged in groups of parallel lines extending in a
longitudinal direction of the optical recording medium, or in groups of
parallel lines that intersect at a predetermined angle with the longitudinal
direction of the medium. Figs. 11A to 11E are schematic plan views
illustrating examples of tape-shaped optical recording media and how the
information recording unit regions can be arranged on the recording layer of
the tape-shaped optical recording media. Fig. 11A shows information
recording unit regions that are arranged in one straight line in the
longitudinal direction. Fig. 11B shows information recording unit regions
that are arranged in groups of parallel straight lines forming a right angle
with the longitudinal direction (lattice point arrangement). Fig. 11C shows
information recording unit regions that are arranged in groups of parallel
straight lines that are tilted at a predetermined angle relative to the
longitudinal direction (uni-axially tilted lattice point arrangement). Fig.
11D shows information recording unit regions that are arranged in a
triangular waveform made of parallel straight lines tilted at a first 
predetermined angle relative to the longitudinal direction and parallel
straight lines tilted at a second predetermined angle relative to the
longitudinal direction. Fig. 11E shows information recording unit regions
that are arranged in groups of parallel straight lines that are tilted at a
predetermined angle relative to the longitudinal direction (bi-axially tilted
lattice point arrangement).</p>
    <p num="0153">For these types of initialization, the tape-shaped optical recording
medium or card-shaped optical recording medium is transported in a
longitudinal direction and the light beam is shifted in a direction
perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the medium, irradiating
polarized orientation light with fixed polarization direction and propagation
direction onto the information recording unit regions, so that the long axis
orientation of the chemisorptive molecules included in the information
recording unit regions can be initialized to a predetermined orientation
state.</p>
    <p num="0154">In these tape-shaped optical recording media or card-shaped optical
recording media, the information recording unit regions can be initialized by
intermittently irradiating the polarized orientation light onto each of the
information recording unit regions, but they also can be initialized by
irradiating the polarized orientation light continuously. It is preferable to
continuously transport the tape-shaped optical recording medium or
card-shaped optical recording medium. Furthermore, it is preferable that,
for the initialization, unpolarized light or polarized light is irradiated onto
the medium substrate from a direction that is substantially perpendicular to
the surface of the medium substrate.</p>
    <p num="0155">In particular in the case of a card-shaped optical recording medium,
it is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions to a
predetermined orientation state by irradiating polarized light with a fixed
polarization direction and propagation direction onto all information
recording unit regions of the recording layer while moving the irradiation
position without transporting the optical recording medium forward.
Furthermore, it is also possible to initialize all information recording unit
regions at once into a random state or a predetermined orientation states by
preparing a photo-mask provided with a predetermined pattern and
irradiating unpolarized or polarized light through the photo-mask onto the
recording layer.</p>
    <p num="0156">Figs. 12A to 12C are schematic plan views showing initialization 
examples for tape-shaped and card-shaped optical recording media. Fig.
12A shows a recording layer 2 that has been partially initialized in a
predetermined orientation state taking the longitudinal direction as the
orientation direction. Fig. 12B shows a recording layer 2 that has been
completely initialized in a predetermined orientation state taking the
longitudinal direction as the orientation direction. Fig. 12C shows a
recording layer 2 that has been partially initialized in a predetermined
orientation state taking a direction other than the longitudinal direction as
the orientation direction.</p>
    <p num="0157">The following is an explanation of the response of the chemisorptive
molecules constituting the recording layer to irradiation with orientation
light. Linearly polarized light is most preferable as the polarized
orientation light. Elliptically polarized light is also acceptable, but in this
case, it is preferable that elliptically polarized light with a large ellipticity is
used. It is also possible to use partially polarized light including linearly
polarized components or partially polarized light including elliptically
polarized components, but this lowers the writing and reading precisions
unless partially polarized light is used that has a high polarization ratio
(also called "polarization degree").</p>
    <p num="0158">For the sake of simplicity, the following explanations are for the case
that linearly polarized light is irradiated. When polarized orientation light
is irradiated, the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer
generally are oriented at a predetermined angle with the propagation
direction of the polarized light within the plane defined by the polarization
direction of the irradiated polarized light and its propagation direction (also
referred to as "polarization plane" in the following), as shown in Fig. 13.
This predetermined angle is a characteristic angle that depends mainly on
the chemisorptive molecules forming the recording layer. However, it seems
that it also depends on other factors such as the molecular density of the
recording layer.</p>
    <p num="0159">The orientation direction can be either of two directions that are
symmetric with respect the propagation direction of the polarized light. As
will be explained further below, even when molecules oriented in those two
directions are mixed, then the two orientation directions cannot be
distinguished if the propagation direction is set to a predetermined direction
in case that the reference light used for the read-out is unpolarized reference
light or if the polarization direction and the propagation direction are set to 
predetermined directions in case that the reference light used for the
read-out is polarized reference light. That is to say, they can be regarded as
the same orientation state. By performing uniaxial orientation by rubbing
or draining as explained above, it is possible to avoid that the chemisorptive
molecules are oriented in two directions.</p>
    <p num="0160">In the present invention, chemisorptive molecules are suitable that
are oriented in a specified direction determined by the polarization direction
and propagation direction of the polarized orientation light, so that they do
not necessarily have to be chemisorptive molecules that are oriented within
the polarization plane upon irradiation with polarized orientation light.</p>
    <p num="0161">Fig. 13 shows a case in which the medium substrate is irradiated
with polarized orientation light from a perpendicular direction (incidence
angle of 0°) but as the incidence angle increases, the interaction between
adjacent chemisorptive molecules and with the medium substrate increases,
and it may occur that the chemisorptive molecules are not oriented within
the plane defined by the polarization direction and the propagation direction
of the polarized orientation light or that the above-mentioned two directions
are not symmetric with respect to the propagation direction of the polarized
orientation light.</p>
    <p num="0162">If unpolarized light is used, it does not have to be completely
unpolarized, but also may be elliptically polarized light with low ellipticity or
partially polarized light with a low polarization ratio. When completely
unpolarized light is irradiated, the orientation of the chemisorptive
molecules changes unsystematically among positions on the conical surface
of a circular cone whose rotation axis coincides with the propagation
direction of the completely unpolarized light (that is, in random directions),
as shown in Fig. 14. Consequently, a random state is achieved in which the
long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules is distributed randomly.
Here, a random state means a state in which the tilt angle of the
chemisorptive molecules against the medium substrate is fixed, but their
orientation is not specified, or a state in which both the tilt angle and the
orientation of the chemisorptive molecules are not specified.</p>
    <p num="0163">The following is an explanation of how the orientation state of the
chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer is read out.
Polarized reference light and unpolarized reference light are light that does
not change the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules when
irradiated on them. The wavelength and the intensity of the reference light 
have to be determined in view of the optical absorption properties of the
chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer. Generally
speaking, the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules
constituting the recording layer does not change unless a certain energy is
absorbed by the chemisorptive molecules. Consequently, if a wavelength is
selected for which the absorption efficiency in the optical absorption
spectrum is low, the irradiation intensity can be selected from a broader
range, which is preferable.</p>
    <p num="0164">The change of the polarized components of the reference light when
passing through an oriented recording layer is explained with reference to
Fig. 15. Figs. 15A and 15B are schematic diagrams illustrating the
orientation state of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording
layer. Fig. 15A is a cross-sectional view showing an orientation state with
different tilt angles. Fig. 15B is a perspective view showing an orientation
state with different orientation directions.</p>
    <p num="0165">When the reference light passes through an oriented recording layer,
polarized light components oscillating in a direction that is orthogonal to the
orientation direction projected into the plane whose normal is the
propagation direction of the reference light have the highest transmissivity.
As the angle between the polarized light components and the projected
orientation direction becomes smaller, the transmissivity of the polarized
components oscillating in that angular direction becomes smaller as well,
and polarized light components oscillating in that projected orientation
direction have the lowest transmissivity. It should be noted, however, that
if the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording film have optical
rotatory power, such as molecules including asymmetric carbon, the
oscillation direction of the polarized light components with the highest
transmissivity and the oscillation direction of the polarized light components
with the lowest transmissivity are respectively rotated in the same direction
by an angle characteristic for the chemisorptive molecules. But in the
present invention, this rotation angle (rotatory angle) is small enough to be
ignored, because the recording layer is extremely thin.</p>
    <p num="0166">For like projected orientation directions but different angles defined
by the projected orientation direction and the orientation direction, the
transmissivity is higher the larger this angle is, and lower the smaller this
angle is.</p>
    <p num="0167">The erasable optical recording media produced as described above 
can be used as follows. First, an erasable optical recording medium whose
recording layer is in a random, state can be used as a photosensitive plate for
recording the position and the polarization direction of irradiated polarized
light. Similarly, an erasable optical recording medium whose recording
layer is in a predetermined orientation state can be used as a photosensitive
plate for recording the position of irradiated unpolarized light. The
erasable optical recording media can be used repeatedly by reinitializing
after each use.</p>
    <p num="0168">Using polarized light for an erasable optical recording medium
provided with a recording layer in a random state, or, in the case of an
erasable optical recording medium provided with a recording medium in a
first predetermined orientation state, using unpolarized light or polarized
light that changes the orientation state to a second orientation state that is
different from the first orientation state, these optical recording media can
be used to record information by rendering characters or graphics on the
optical recording media.</p>
    <p num="0169">If there are information recording unit regions in the recording layer
of the erasable optical recording medium, the optical recording media also
can be used to record digital information by writing information elements
into one information recording unit region at a time by irradiating light for a
predetermined orientation. The recording of digital information is
explained in more detail in Embodiment 5 below.</p>
    <heading>

    </heading>
    <p num="0170">In this embodiment, a write-once optical recording medium whose
medium substrate surface is provided with the write-once optical recording
film as the recording layer is explained. Instead of using the substrate of
Embodiment 1, it is also possible to manufacture a write-once optical
recording medium in the same manner as in Embodiment 1, except that an
optically reflective medium substrate or an optically transmissive medium
substrate is used instead of the substrate of Embodiment 1.</p>
    <p num="0171">In the case of chemisorptive molecules having at one end a functional
group reacting with active hydrogen, a recording layer in the form of a
chemically bonded monomolecular recording film can be formed easily. For
such chemisorptive molecules, it is possible to use a silane-based surface
active agent, such as a chlorosilane-based surface active agent, an 
alkoxysilane-based surface active agent, or an isocyanatosilane-based
surface active agent, as in Embodiment 1.</p>
    <p num="0172">As chemisorptive molecules having photoreactive functional groups,
it is possible to use molecules having photo-polymerizable functional groups.
If the photoreactive functional groups are photo-polymerizable functional
groups, the chemisorptive molecules can be oriented in a specified direction
by irradiation with polarized reaction light, and the orientation direction can
be fixed by polymerizing or crosslinking the chemisorptive molecules
constituting the optical recording film to one another. Here,
"photo-polymerizable" also includes thermally polymerizable by optical
absorption.</p>
    <p num="0173">The chemisorptive molecules may have some branched chains, as
long as this does not compromise the orientation properties, but it is
preferable that they have as few branched chains as possible. It is even
more preferable to use straight-chain backbone molecules, linear backbone
molecules or straight-chain backbone molecules or linear backbone
molecules having substitution groups, as described in Embodiment 1.</p>
    <p num="0174">As in Embodiment 1, a non-aqueous organic solvent is used as the
organic solvent in the chemisorptive solution preparation step.
Furthermore, a rinsing step for rinsing away the unreacted chemisorptive
molecules remaining on the medium substrate is carried out after the
recording film formation step. A non-aqueous organic solvent is used as the
organic solvent in the rinsing step.</p>
    <p num="0175">As a method for bringing the substrate and the chemisorptive
solution into contact during the recording film formation step, it is possible
to apply the chemisorptive solution to the substrate or to immerse the
substrate in the chemisorptive solution. When forming a recording layer on
both sides of the medium substrate, it is preferable to use immersion in the
chemisorptive solution. With this method, recording layers can be formed
simultaneously on the front and the rear side of the medium substrate.</p>
    <p num="0176">As for the shape, it is preferable that the medium substrate is
disk-shaped, tape-shaped or card-shaped. For disk-shaped or card-shaped
medium substrates, base materials with high rigidity, such as metal, ceramic
or glass base materials are suitable. For tape-shaped medium substrates,
base materials with high flexibility, such as synthetic resin base materials
are suitable.</p>
    <p num="0177">Furthermore, depending on whether the method for reading the 
recorded information is for transmissive medium substrates or reflective
medium substrates, medium substrates can be classified broadly into
optically transmissive medium substrates and optically reflective medium
substrates.</p>
    <p num="0178">A transmissive optical recording medium can be fabricated by using
an optically transmissive base material, such as glass, for the optically
transmissive substrate, and forming the recording layer on the surface of the
optically transmissive base material. It is also possible to form a
transparent coating made of an optically transmissive substance group on
the optically transmissive base material, and to form the recording layer on
the surface of this transparent coating. Forming the recording layer via
such a transparent coating broadens the range of base materials that can be
selected.</p>
    <p num="0179">A reflective optical recording medium can be fabricated by using an
optically reflective medium substrate in which a suitable base material is
provided with a reflective film made of an optically reflective material, and
forming the recording layer on the surface of this medium substrate. It is
preferable that the reflective film has superior optical reflectance, and
examples of materials for such a reflective film are materials mainly
including metallic aluminum. Furthermore, if a material with high
smoothness is used, a reflective film that has uniform film thickness and an
even surface can be formed. Using metallic aluminum including several
percent by weight of silicon for example, a reflective film with superior
optical reflectance and smoothness can be formed.</p>
    <p num="0180">Furthermore, using an optically reflective base material made of an
optically reflective material, it is possible to manufacture a reflective optical
recording medium provided with a monomolecular recording layer on the
surface of an optically reflective substrate.</p>
    <p num="0181">It is also possible to form the recording layer on a reflective film or
optically reflective base substrate with a transparent coating made of an
optically transmissive material disposed therebetween. With this
configuration, an optical recording medium provided with a reflective film
that is highly resistant against for example exfoliation can be attained.
And if it is a transparent coating having functional groups including active
hydrogen at the transparent coating surface or into which such functional
groups can be introduced easily, then a monomolecular recording layer can
be formed easily even on a reflective film to which the chemisorptive 
molecules cannot be easily chemisorbed.</p>
    <p num="0182">When, after the recording layer formation step, the chemisorptive
molecules constituting the information recording unit regions are initialized
to a predetermined orientation direction by irradiating the optical recording
medium with (polarized light or unpolarized) light, write-once optical
recording media of various initialization states can be manufactured. After
the recording layer formation step, the chemisorptive molecules in the
recording layer are in a random state in which their orientation direction is
not specified. It is also possible to use the recording medium without
initialization, but if there are regions that are oriented in a certain direction,
then this may lead to unexpected malfunctioning during operation, so that in
the case of a recording layer that is changed into a random state by
irradiation with unpolarized light, it is preferable that the chemisorptive
molecules are reliably initialized into a random state in an initialization step.
The following is an explanation of the initialization as well as the initialized
state of a write-once optical recording medium.</p>
    <p num="0183">If all information recording unit regions of the write-once optical
recording medium can be set to the same orientation state, then it is possible
to initialize the entire recording layer in the initialization step, or to
initialize the recording layer partially. The orientation state may be a
random state, an arbitrary orientation state with fixed orientation direction,
or a predetermined orientation state with fixed orientation direction. If the
chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer can be oriented
optically, then the orientation state also may be an arbitrary orientation
state without fixed orientation direction, or a predetermined orientation
state without fixed orientation direction.</p>
    <p num="0184">Furthermore, in the initialization step, it is also possible to subject
the surface of the recording layer to a rubbing process to initialize the
recording layer to an arbitrary orientation state or a predetermined
orientation state. In this case, the reading precision may be lowered due to
diffused reflection when the surface of the medium substrate is damaged, so
that it is essential to ensure that the surface of the medium substrate is
damaged as little as possible.</p>
    <p num="0185">To initialize the entire recording layer, it is possible to initialize the
entire recording layer into an arbitrary fixed orientation state or a
predetermined fixed orientation state by bulk irradiation or scanning
irradiation with polarized reaction light with fixed polarization direction and 
propagation direction. A recording layer that can be oriented with polarized
light can be initialized to an arbitrary orientation state or a predetermined
orientation state by bulk irradiation or scanning irradiation of the entire
recording layer with polarized orientation light with fixed polarization
direction and propagation direction. A recording layer also having the
property that it can be changed to a random state by irradiation with
unpolarized light can be initialized to a random state by bulk irradiation or
scanning irradiation of the entire recording layer with unpolarized
orientation light.</p>
    <p num="0186">Taking disk-shaped, tape-shaped and card-shaped optical recording
media as examples, the following is an explanation of how the recording
layer can be partially initialized.</p>
    <p num="0187">In the case of a disk-shaped optical recording medium, it is preferable
to arrange the information recording unit regions in groups of concentric
circles or in a spiral shape. In this case, the orientation state of all
chemisorptive molecules included in the information recording unit regions
can be initialized to a random state or a predetermined orientation state or a
predetermined fixed orientation state by rotating the disk-shaped optical
recording medium and moving unpolarized orientation light or polarized
orientation light or polarized reaction light with fixed polarization direction
and propagation direction in radial direction.</p>
    <p num="0188">To initialize a disk-shaped optical recording medium, it is possible to
intermittently irradiate unpolarized orientation light, polarized orientation
light, or polarized reaction light onto each of the information recording unit
regions, or to successively irradiate the information recording unit regions
continuously with orientation light. In this case, it is preferable that the
disk-shaped optical recording medium is rotated continuously.
Furthermore, it is preferable to irradiate the medium substrate with
unpolarized orientation light or polarized orientation light from a direction
substantially perpendicular to the disk-shaped medium substrate surface.</p>
    <p num="0189">It is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions
into an arbitrary fixed orientation state at once without rotating the
disk-shaped optical recording medium by preparing a photo-mask provided
with a predetermined pattern and irradiating polarized reaction light with
fixed polarization direction and propagation direction through the
photo-mask onto the recording layer.</p>
    <p num="0190">Furthermore, it is also possible to initialize all information recording 
unit regions into an arbitrary fixed orientation state at once by forming a
photo-mask on a polarizer, irradiating unpolarized reaction light through the
polarizer, and irradiating the recording layer with the polarized reaction
light that has passed through the polarizer.</p>
    <p num="0191">In the case of a tape-shaped optical recording medium or a
card-shaped optical recording medium, it is preferable that the information
recording unit regions are arranged in parallel lines or groups of parallel
lines extending in a longitudinal direction of the optical recording medium,
or in groups of parallel lines that intersect at a predetermined angle with the
longitudinal direction of the medium.</p>
    <p num="0192">For these types of initialization, the tape-shaped optical recording
medium or card-shaped optical recording medium is transported in
longitudinal direction and the polarized orientation light or polarized
reaction light with fixed polarization direction and propagation direction is
shifted in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the
medium, so that the orientation state of all chemisorptive molecules included
in the information recording unit regions can be initialized to a
predetermined orientation state or a predetermined fixed orientation state.</p>
    <p num="0193">In these tape-shaped optical recording media or card-shaped optical
recording media, all information recording unit regions can be initialized by
intermittently irradiating the polarized orientation light or the polarized
reaction light onto each of the information recording unit regions, but it is
also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions with
continuously irradiated polarized orientation light or polarized reaction light.
It is preferable to continuously rotate the tape-shaped optical recording
medium or card-shaped optical recording medium. Furthermore, it is
preferable that the polarized orientation light or polarized reaction light is
irradiated onto the medium substrate from a direction that is substantially
perpendicular to the surface of the medium substrate.</p>
    <p num="0194">In particular in the case of a card-shaped optical recording medium,
it is also possible to initialize all information recording unit regions to a first
predetermined orientation state, a first predetermined fixed orientation
state, an arbitrary orientation state or an arbitrary fixed orientation state by
irradiating polarized light with a fixed polarization direction and
propagation direction onto all information recording unit regions of the
recording layer while moving the irradiation position without transporting
the optical recording medium forward. Furthermore, it is also possible to 
initialize all information recording unit regions at once by preparing a
photo-mask provided with a predetermined pattern and irradiating polarized
light through the photo-mask onto the recording layer.</p>

    <p num="0195">Embodiment 5 illustrates a recording method for recording digital
information onto an erasable optical recording medium and a reproduction
method for reading digital information recorded on an erasable optical
recording medium.</p>
    <p num="0196">The recording and reproduction methods for the erasable optical
recording medium do not depend on the initialization state of the erasable
optical recording medium. Consequently, all of the following recording and
reproduction methods can be applied for any initialization state, if the
recording layer has the property of being oriented by polarized light that
changes the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules in a
specified direction that is determined by the polarization direction and the
propagation direction of the polarized orientation light when polarized
orientation light that is absorbed by the optically absorbing functional
groups is irradiated, and the property that the long axis orientation of the
chemisorptive molecules is changed in random directions when irradiated
with unpolarized light that is absorbed by the optically absorbing functional
groups. However, with recording layers having only the property of being
oriented by polarized light, it is not possible to apply recording and
reproduction methods using a random state as an information element.</p>
    <p num="0197">First, the relationship between information elements and the long
axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording
layer of the optical recording medium is explained. The ways to write
information elements into the information recording unit regions can be
broadly classified into two approaches, depending on whether the long axis
orientation of the chemisorptive molecules included in the information
recording unit regions is changed comprehensively into the same state, or
whether the information recording unit regions are divided into two
partitioned regions, and the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive
molecules included in the partitioned regions is changed such that it is the
same within the same partitioned regions and different among different
partitioned regions. In the former, the information elements are specified
by the orientation of the chemisorptive molecules, and in the latter, the 
information elements are specified by the area ratio of the partitioned
regions in the two different orientation states.</p>
    <p num="0198">Figs. 16A to 16D are schematic plan views illustrating the
relationship between the information elements and the orientation states of
the chemisorptive molecules constituting the recording layer. Fig. 16A
shows an example of a binary recording, in which the long axis orientation of

regions in the recording layer 2 is taken as the information element. Fig.

as information elements.</p>
    <p num="0208">For higher base representations, in case of base 2m representations
(wherein m is an natural number), the conversion from binary information
signals to base 2m information signals becomes easy. In general,
even-numbered bit information is used as the information units, so that it is
preferable to use a base 2m representation (wherein m is an natural
number).</p>
    <p num="0209">For the plurality of different predetermined orientation states in the
recording, it is preferable that the tilt angle with respect to the medium
substrate is constant and only the inclination angle is different, or that the
inclination angle with respect to the medium substrate is constant and only
the tilt angle is different. The former case can be achieved by irradiating
recording light whose propagation direction is held in a predetermined
direction with respect to a reference direction of the optical recording
medium, but with different polarization directions. In this case, it is
preferable that the propagation direction of the polarized recording light is
perpendicular to the surface of the optical recording medium. In the latter
case, the polarization direction is held in a reference direction of the optical
recording medium, and the polarized recording light is irradiated with
different propagation directions.</p>
    <p num="0210">Considering the ease and the precision with which information can
be written or read out, it is preferable that for the plurality of predetermined
orientation states with different orientation directions, predetermined
orientation states in which the tilt angle with respect to the medium
substrate is constant and only the orientation direction is different are taken
as information elements.</p>
    <p num="0211">In recordings in which the information elements are specified by the
area ratio of the partitioned regions with two different orientation states,
preferable sets of two kinds of orientation states are sets of a random state
and a predetermined orientation state, and sets of a first predetermined
orientation state and a second predetermined orientation state. 
Information recordings with binary representations using a first area ratio
and a second area ratio as the information elements, or with higher base
representations using three or more area ratios as the information elements
are also possible.</p>
    <p num="0212">The following is an explanation of a method for reproducing
information. This should be a method in which the information elements
written into the information recording unit regions can be specified by
irradiating reference light, and the reference light can be irradiated one by
one on each of the information recording unit regions, or it can be irradiated
on a region including a plurality of information recording unit regions. If
the reference light is irradiated one by one on each of the information
recording unit regions, then it is preferable that the reference light is focused
within the information recording unit regions, which improves the reading
precision. If the reference light is irradiated on a region including a
plurality of information recording unit regions, then the information
elements in a plurality of information recording unit regions can be specified
simultaneously by specifying the intensity of the reference light that has
passed through the various information recording unit regions or the
intensity distribution of the polarized light components of that reference
light.</p>
    <p num="0213">The following is an explanation of information reproduction methods
in which reference light is irradiated one by one onto each set of information
elements in the recording layer, one by one for each information recording
unit region.</p>
    <p num="0214">Firstly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded
using a random state and an arbitrary orientation state as information
elements, the information elements can be specified in terms of the presence
of an arbitrary orientation by irradiating unpolarized reference light one by
one onto each of the information recording unit regions and measuring the
intensity of light that is transmitted through the information recording unit
regions to detect the presence of an arbitrary orientation. It is also possible
to specify the information elements in terms of the random state by passing
the transmitted light through a polarizer and measuring the intensity of the
reference light for a plurality of orientations of the transmission axis of the
polarizer, and detecting the absence of a dependency of the intensity
distribution of the polarized components of the transmitted light from the
orientation (indicating a random state). </p>
    <p num="0215">Secondly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded
using a random state and a predetermined orientation state as information
elements, the information elements can be specified in terms of the presence
of the predetermined orientation by irradiating unpolarized reference light
onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of the transmitted
light.</p>
    <p num="0216">The information elements also can be specified with high precision in
terms of orientation differences by irradiating unpolarized reference light
onto the recording layer and measuring the intensity of transmitted light
that has passed through a polarizer whose transmission axis has been
arranged in a predetermined orientation. In this case, it is preferable that
the orientation of the transmission axis is set such that changes due to the
differences among the information elements become maximal.</p>
    <p num="0217">The information elements also can be specified by irradiating
polarized reference light onto the recording layer and measuring the
intensity of transmitted light. In this case, if the polarization direction of
the reference light is identical with or perpendicular to the polarization
direction of the polarized recording light used to introduce the different
predetermined orientation states, then the information elements can be
specified with high precision in terms of their different orientations, which is
preferable.</p>
    <p num="0218">The information elements also can be specified in terms of
orientation differences by irradiating polarized reference light onto the
recording layer and measuring the intensity of transmitted light that has
further passed through a polarizer. In this case, if the polarization direction
of the polarized reference light is identical with or perpendicular to the
polarization direction of the polarized recording light used to introduce the
different predetermined orientation states, then the information elements
can be specified with high precision in terms of their different orientations,
which is preferable.</p>
    <p num="0219">Thirdly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded
using two predetermined orientation states as information elements, the
information elements can be specified in terms of their different orientations
by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer and

the method for specifying the information elements may be a method of
specifying the information elements by detecting the orientation direction by 
ascertaining whether the measured intensity is larger or smaller than a
predetermined first intensity, a method of specifying the information
elements by detecting the orientation direction by ascertaining whether the
measured intensity is within a predetermined first intensity range, a method
of specifying the information elements by detecting the orientation direction
by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is larger than a
predetermined first intensity or smaller than a predetermined second
intensity, or it can be the reliable method of specifying the information
elements by detecting the orientation direction by ascertaining whether the
measured intensity is within a predetermined first intensity range or within
a predetermined second intensity range.</p>
    <p num="0220">The information elements also can be specified in terms of
orientation differences by irradiating polarized reference light onto the

the two different predetermined orientation states, then the information
elements can be specified with high precision.</p>
    <p num="0221">The information elements also can be specified in terms of

different from the predetermined orientation state as information elements,
the information elements can be specified in terms of their different

polarizer. Here, the method for specifying the information elements may be
a method of specifying the information elements by detecting the orientation

predetermined intensity range.</p>
    <p num="0223">Fifthly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded 
using three or more predetermined orientation states of different
orientations as information elements, the information elements can be
specified by irradiating unpolarized reference light onto the recording layer
and measuring the intensity distribution of the polarized light components of
the light that has been transmitted through the recording layer for a
plurality of different orientations of the transmission axis of a polarizer to
detect the intensity distribution of the polarized light components of the
transmitted light.</p>
    <p num="0224">Furthermore, using polarized reference light with a polarization
direction that is not linearly symmetric to any two predetermined
orientation states selected from three or more predetermined orientation
states corresponding to information elements, the various information
elements can be specified by irradiating polarized reference light onto the
recording layer and measuring the intensity of the transmitted light. To
specify the information elements in this case, it is possible to detect the
orientation direction by ascertaining whether the measured intensity is
within predetermined intensity ranges corresponding to respective
information elements.</p>

specify the information elements in this case, it is possible to detect the long
axis orientation of the chemisorptive molecules (i.e. predetermined and
random orientation), depending on whether the measured intensity is within
predetermined intensity ranges corresponding to respective information 
elements.</p>
    <p num="0227">Seventhly, in the reproduction of information that has been recorded
using, as information elements, a plurality of partition states with different
area partition ratios between a first partition region of a random state and a

      <i>Embodiment 6</i>
    </heading>
    <p num="0236">Embodiment 6 illustrates a recording method for recording digital
information onto a write-once optical recording medium and a reproduction
method for reading digital information recorded on a write-once optical
recording medium.</p>
    <p num="0237">In contrast to the erasable optical recording medium of Embodiment
5, the recording methods for a write-once optical recording medium depend
on the initialization state of the write-once optical recording medium.
Consequently, the recording methods are explained for each of the
initialization states of the write-once optical recording medium in
Embodiment 4. In this Embodiment 6, different predetermined directions
mean different orientation directions.</p>
    <p num="0238">First, as in Embodiment 5, the ways to write information elements
can be broadly classified into two approaches, depending on whether the
orientation state of the chemisorptive molecules included in the information
recording unit regions is changed comprehensively into the same state, or
whether the information recording unit regions are divided into two
partitioned regions, and the orientation state of the chemisorptive molecules
included in the partitioned regions is changed such that it is the same within
the same partitioned regions and different among different partitioned
regions. In the former, the information elements are specified by the
orientation of the chemisorptive molecules, and binary representations using
two information elements or higher base representations using three or more
information elements are possible. In the latter, the information elements
are specified by the area ratio of the two partitioned regions in the different
orientation states, and binary representations using two partition ratios or
higher base representations using three or more partition ratios are possible.</p>
    <p num="0239">Different from Embodiment 5, at least one kind of information
element has to be in a fixed state of orientation. It is not preferable that a
state in which the orientation is fixed to the random state is used as an
information element. This is because it is very difficult to polymerize the
organic molecules constituting the recording layer while maintaining the 
random state at high precision.</p>
    <p num="0240">Firstly, when recording information on a write-once optical recording
medium provided with a recording layer that is initialized to a random state
and whose orientation can be fixed by polarized light, then it is preferable to
use as the sets of information elements a random state and an arbitrary
orientation state or a predetermined orientation state, a random state and a
plurality of predetermined fixed orientation states, a first predetermined
fixed orientation state and a second predetermined fixed orientation state, or
three or more predetermined fixed orientation states.</p>
    <p num="0241">Secondly, when recording information on a write-once optical
recording medium provided with a recording layer that is initialized to a
predetermined orientation state of a first orientation direction and whose
orientation can be fixed by polarized light, then it is preferable to use as the
sets of information elements a predetermined orientation state that is
oriented in the first orientation direction of the initialization state and a
predetermined fixed orientation state that is oriented and fixed in a second
orientation direction different from the first orientation direction, a
predetermined orientation state that is oriented in the first orientation
direction of the initialization state and a plurality of predetermined fixed
orientation states oriented in orientation directions that are different from
the first orientation direction as well as mutually different, a second
predetermined fixed orientation state that is oriented in a second orientation
direction different from the orientation direction of the initialization state
and a predetermined fixed orientation state that is oriented in a third
orientation direction that is different from the first orientation direction and
the second orientation direction, or a plurality of predetermined fixed
orientation states oriented in orientation directions that are different from
the first orientation direction of the initialization state as well as mutually
different,</p>
    <p num="0242">Thirdly, when recording information on a write-once optical recording
medium provided with a recording layer that is initialized to an arbitrary
orientation state and whose orientation can be fixed by polarized light, then
it is preferable to use as the sets of information elements a first
predetermined fixed orientation state that is oriented in a first orientation
direction and a second predetermined fixed orientation state that is oriented
in a second orientation direction different from the first orientation direction,
or a plurality of predetermined fixed orientation states oriented in 
orientation directions that are different from the first orientation direction of
the initialization state as well as mutually different,</p>
    <p num="0243">Fourthly, when recording information on a write-once optical
recording medium provided with a recording layer that is initialized to first
predetermined fixed orientation state in which all information recording unit
regions have been oriented and fixed to a first orientation direction, then it is
possible to use as the set of information elements the first predetermined
fixed orientation state of the initialization state and a random state attained
by destroying the film structure of the recording layer.</p>
    <p num="0244">Fifthly, when recording information on a write-once optical recording
medium provided with a recording layer that is initialized to an arbitrary
orientation state in which the information recording unit regions have been
oriented and fixed to an arbitrary orientation direction, then it is possible to
use as the set of information elements the arbitrary orientation state of the
initialization state and a random state attained by destroying the film
structure of the recording layer.</p>
    <p num="0245">The following is an explanation of methods for reproducing recorded
information. To specify the information elements, it is possible to regard
predetermined fixed orientation states and predetermined orientation states
with like orientation directions as like information elements. Consequently,
it is possible to reproduce recorded information in the same manner as in the
reproduction methods described in Embodiment 5.</p>

      <i>Embodiment 7</i>
    </heading>
    <p num="0246">Embodiment 7 illustrates an information recording/reproducing
device for recording and reproducing information on an erasable optical
recording medium or a write-once optical recording medium. Fig. 23 is a
block diagram illustrating the configuration of this information
recording/reproducing device. The control lines L1 to L5, which are
indicated by broken lines in Fig. 23, depend on the configuration of the
information recording/reproducing device, and if only the optical recording
medium is driven, then the control line L3 from the position control driving
portion 40 to the information storage portion 43 is sufficient. If only the
irradiated light is moved, then the control line L1 from the position control
driving portion 40 to the recording light emission portion 41 and the control
line L2 from the position control driving portion 40 to the reference light
emission portion 42 are necessary. However, either L1 and L2 or L3 have to 
be provided. For an information recording/reproducing device provided
with an information element detecting portion 44 having a movable polarizer,
or an information recording/reproducing device in which the information
element detecting portion 44 moves in the course of irradiation of reference
light, the control line L4 from the position control driving portion 40 to the
information element detecting portion 44 is necessary. Signals from the
information element detecting portion 44 are sent to the signal input/output
portion 45, if necessary exchanged with an external device 46, and then
entered into a control circuit portion 47. From there the signals are sent to
the position control driving portion 40, the recording light emission portion
41 and the reference light emission portion 42.</p>
    <p num="0247">The information recording/reproducing device may incorporate an
optical recording medium, or the optical recording medium may be of a
removable type, so that it can be inserted and retrieved. Compared to
conventional information recording/reproducing devices using magnetic
disks, magnetic tapes, flexible disks (FDs), optomagnetic disks and CDs, the
main differences are the recording medium, the method for recording
information and the method for reproducing information. For the operation
method of the information recording/reproducing device according to the
present invention, roughly the same technology as for conventional
information recording/reproducing devices can be utilized.</p>
    <p num="0248">As recording media, it is possible to use reflective-type reproduction
optical recording media or transmissive-type reproduction optical recording
media. In case of a reflective-type reproduction optical recording medium,
both the recording light and the reference light should be incident from the
side of the recording layer 2 of the recording medium 3, as shown in Fig. 24.
It is possible to guide the recording light and the reference light from the
recording light emission portion and the reference light emission portion
arranged at suitable positions with an optical system (optical transfer
system), but in general, it is preferable that the optical path from the
recording light emission portion to the optical recording medium and the
optical path from the reference light emission portion to the optical recording
medium are straight lines, because changing the propagation direction by
reflective plates or the like also may change the polarization direction. It is
also preferable that the reference light is perpendicularly incident on the
optical recording medium, because this reduces changes in the polarization
components of the reference light due to reflections at the optical reflection 
film 5 of the recording medium. That is to say, it is preferable that the
recording light emission portion and the reference light emission portion are
arranged above the recording layer 2 of the optical recording medium and
the recording light and the reference light are emitted perpendicularly onto
the optical recording medium.</p>
    <p num="0249">In this case, light that has passed through the recording layer and
has been reflected at the optically reflective film 5 may be guided to an
optical sensor with beam splitters, half mirrors or the like. In order to
improve the recording/reproducing precision, it is essential that the
orientation of the reflection plane of the beam splitters or half mirrors is
optimized in accordance with the recording method.</p>
    <p num="0250">When using an optical recording medium provided with recording
layers on the front and the rear side of the recording medium, then it is
preferable that a recording light emission portion and a reference light
emission portion for the front side recording layer as well as a recording light
emission portion and a reference light emission portion for the rear side
recording layer are provided. It is also possible to provide only one set of
recording light emission portion and reference light emission portion and to
guide the recording light and the reference light to the front and the rear
recording layers with an optical system.</p>
    <p num="0251">In case of a transmissive-type reproduction optical recording medium,
it is possible to let the reference light be incident from the recording layer
side of the optical recording medium, but it is also possible to let it be
incident from the side opposite the recording layer. The same is true for the
recording light. Figs. 25A to 25D are schematic cross-sectional views
showing the irradiation directions of recording light and reference light with
respect to the recording layer 2 of an optical recording medium provided with
an optically transmissive medium substrate 3. In Fig. 25A, the recording
light and the reference light are irradiated from the side of the recording
layer 2. In Fig. 25B, the recording light is irradiated from the side of the
recording layer 2, and the reference light is irradiated from the side of the
medium substrate 3. In Fig. 25C, the recording light is irradiated from the
side of the medium substrate 3, and the reference light is irradiated from the
side of the recording layer 2. In Fig. 25D, the recording light and the
reference light are irradiated from the side of the medium substrate 3.</p>
    <p num="0252">As in the above-described case of a reflective-type optical recording
medium, it is preferable that the optical path from the recording light 
emission portion to the optical recording medium and the optical path from
the reference light emission portion to the optical recording medium are
straight lines. It is also preferable that the reference light is
perpendicularly incident on the optical recording medium, because this
reduces changes in the polarization components of the reference light due to
refraction when passing through the recording medium.</p>

    <p num="0261">If the recording means A or B and the reproduction means B or D are
used, the same polarizer can be used for the polarizer of the recording means

    <p num="0262">Furthermore, assuming that the transmission axis of the analyzer is
not influenced by the recording layer and that the polarized recording light is
guided over the same route to the analyzer as the reference light, it is most
preferable that the transmission axis of the analyzer is perpendicular to the

      <i>Working Example 1</i>
    </heading>
    <p num="0341">First, a glass substrate 1 that has been processed into disk shape was
prepared as a base material and rinsed thoroughly. Then, aluminum (Al)
including 2% by weight of silicon (Si) was vacuum vapor deposited on the
surface of the glass substrate 1 to form an optically reflective film 5. The
thickness of the optically reflective film 5 was set to about 500 nm. Then,
functional groups including active hydrogen resulting from natural oxidation
were introduced into the topmost surface of the optically reflective film 5 by
exposure to a moist air atmosphere, thus producing a substrate 3 whose
topmost surface has functional groups including active hydrogen.</p>
    <p num="0342">Next, a linear chlorosilane surface active agent A (also referred to as
"chemisorptive compound" in the following) of the formula
CH<sub>3</sub>-COO-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>-SiCl<sub>3</sub>, which has a trichlorosilyl group (-SiCl<sub>3</sub>),
which is a functional group chemically bonding with the active hydrogen of
the substrate, at one end and includes -COOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-, an optically absorbing
functional group, was prepared. Then, the chlorosilane surface active agent
A was dissolved to a concentration of about 1% by weight in thoroughly
dehydrated hexadecane, which is a non-aqueous solvent, thus preparing a
chemisorptive solution 34 (chemisorptive solution preparation step).</p>
    <p num="0343">The substrate 3 was immersed in the chemisorptive solution 34
under a dry atmosphere (of not more than 30% relative humidity) for about
one hour (see Fig. 2). Thus, the chlorosilane surface active agent A was
chemisorbed to the surface of the substrate 3, and a monomolecular optical
recording film 2, chemically bonded as CH<sub>3</sub>-COO-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>-Si(-O-)<sub>3</sub> to
the substrate 3, was formed (recording film formation step) (see Fig. 2).</p>
    <p num="0344">After that, the substrate 3 was retrieved from the chemisorptive
solution 34, rinsed with thoroughly dehydrated n-hexane 32, which is a
non-aqueous organic solvent, to rinse off the unreacted silane-based surface
active agent remaining on the substrate 3 (rinsing step). Then, the
substrate 3 was exposed to air including a water component (moisture) to
fabricate the optical recording film 2.</p>
    <p num="0345">In this series of steps, the trichlorosilyl group in the 
chlorosilane-based surface active agent A and hydroxyl groups at the surface
of the optically reflective film 5 (many -OH groups are created by forming
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at the surface by natural oxidation of Al and further reacting it with
water molecules in air), undergo a dechlorination reaction, forming chemical
bonds with the surface of the optical recording film 5. Moreover, when the
substrate is exposed to air after the chemisorption, siloxane bonds among the
chemisorptive molecules are created by reaction with the water component
in the air, so that a recording layer in the form of a monomolecular film
including optically absorbing-COOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is formed at the surface of the
optical recording film 5 (see Fig. 1).</p>
    <p num="0346">Furthermore, since hydrocarbon groups (in this case, -CH<sub>3</sub> and
-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>) are hydrophobic, the -CH<sub>3</sub> groups are chemisorbed to the
hydrophilic surface such that the molecules of the chlorosilane surface active
agent stand obliquely on the surface.</p>
    <p num="0347">Next, the substrate 3 was rotated, and first polarized orientation
light was focused in dots from a substantially perpendicular direction onto
the surface of the substrate 3, making the polarization direction of the
polarized orientation light substantially parallel to the rotation direction of
the substrate. The -COOC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>- groups, which are optically absorbing
groups, have the property of absorbing light of a wavelength of 230 to 300 nm,
so that polarized light from a super-high pressure mercury lamp of a
wavelength of 254 nm was used for the polarized light. The diameter of the
focused polarized orientation light on the surface of the recording layer 2
(referred to as "spot diameter" in the following) was set to 1.2 µm, and its
intensity was set to 500 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> (initialization step) (see Fig. 31A).</p>
    <p num="0348">After the irradiation of the polarized orientation light, the surface of
the disk-shaped optical recording medium was examined with a microscopic
Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (referred to as "microscopic FT-IR"
in the following), and it was found that the dots were lined up in concentric
circles, and the chemisorptive molecules 6 included in the dots were
arranged substantially parallel to the rotation direction of the substrate 3
(Figs. 31B and 31C).</p>
    <p num="0349">Furthermore, examining the surface with the microscopic FT-IR
confirmed that when dots are first irradiated with a first polarized
orientation light and then with a second polarized orientation light with the
same propagation direction but different polarization direction, the
chemisorptive molecules were oriented substantially parallel to the 
polarization direction of the second polarized orientation light. It was also
confirmed that if unpolarized orientation light is irradiated instead of the
first polarized orientation light, a random state without specifiable
orientation direction results.</p>
    <p num="0350">Irradiating polarized light of a wavelength corresponding to the
absorption peak of the chemisorptive molecules 6 constituting the recording
film, it was possible to align the long axis orientation of the chemisorptive
molecules 6 included in the dots to be substantially parallel to the rotation
direction of the substrate 3 at a low energy of about 250 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p num="0351">Also, an erasable optical recording film could be formed in a similar
manner when using a silane-based surface active agent having an
alkoxysilyl group or an isocyanate group instead of the trichlorosilyl group.
More specifically, erasable optical recording media could be manufactured

are in a second predetermined fixed orientation state were formed by
irradiating first polarized reaction recording light and second polarized

up with the optical sensor to confirm the orientation of the chemisorptive
