  <abstract load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p>A PLL frequency synthesizer (1) is provided with a
switch circuit (10) interposed between a low-pass
filter circuit (103) and a voltage-controlled
oscillator (104). The switch circuit (10) is
controlled based on a control signal (Sent) to
open/close control a feedback loop lying between the
low-pass filter circuit (103) and the voltage-controlled
oscillator (104). Namely, the switch
circuit (10) is opened according to a path-opening
instruction of a feedback loop based on the control
signal (Scnt) to open the feedback loop, thereby
stopping the operation of the feedback loop. If this
stop operation is controlled according to the control
signal (Sent) so as to be carried out during a period
in which a pseudo correction pulse is outputted from a
charge pump circuit (102) for each phase comparison
cycle of a phase comparator (101), then spurious
generation incident to the pseudo correction pulse can
be suppressed. In this way even a spurious
characteristic in a lock state can be improved while
ensuring a high-speed lockup characteristic to thereby
implement satisfactory communication quality.

  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a PLL frequency synthesizer,
and particularly to a PLL frequency synthesizer capable of achieving
an improvement in spurious characteristic in a steady state while
maintaining a high-speed lockup characteristic.</p>
    <p num="0002">In mobile communications for cellular telephones or the like
which have widely been available in recent years, communications are
made based on a carrier frequency corresponding to a predetermined
frequency. In order to ensure communication quality and
satisfactorily keep a C/N (Carrier to Noise) characteristic in the
communications at this time, there is a need to accurately lock a
predetermined carrier frequency, and hence a PLL frequency synthesizer
has been used. The operation of locking the carrier frequency by the
PLL frequency synthesizer is needed not only during a communication
period but also during a so-called standby period corresponding to
a state of waiting for reception from the party on the other end of
the communication. That's why it needs to always detect the presence
or absence of a communication access from the communication party
and immediately establish communications when the access is received.
On the other hand, a mobile communications apparatus such as a cellular
phone or the like needs to reduce its current consumption to the minimum
according to its portability. Thus, in the apparatuses used under
the present conditions in order to implement a standby or awaiting
operation while current consumption is being suppressed, a PLL
frequency synthesizer is intermittently operated only during a
predetermined period set for each predetermined cycle to carry out 
an intermittent operation for locking a carrier frequency and
performing the standby operation, thereby coping with it. With a view
toward promptly carrying out a repeated operation of lock and stop
operations at a carrier frequency for each predetermined cycle or
period, it is necessary to make a lockup characteristic of the PLL
frequency synthesizer faster and set low the time constant of a low-pass
filter circuit.</p>
    <p num="0003">FIG. 11 shows a PLL frequency synthesizer 100 according to a
prior art. A phase comparator 101 receives therein a reference
frequency signal fr and an output frequency signal fp outputted from
a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 104. Then the phase comparator
101 outputs phase difference signals Pr and Pp each corresponding
to the difference in phase between the reference frequency signal
fr and the output frequency signal fp. A charge pump circuit 102
receives these signals therein and outputs a voltage output signal
Do. A low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 103 eliminates AC components of
the voltage output signal Do and makes adjustments around the phase
to ensure the stability of a system. Besides, the low-pass filter
(LPF) circuit 103 outputs a control voltage signal Vt to the
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 104. Then the voltage-controlled
oscillator (VCO) 104 outputs the output frequency signal fp
corresponding to the control voltage signal Vt. The PLL frequency
synthesizer 100 forms a feedback loop which returns from the phase
comparator 101 to the phase comparator 101 via the charge pump circuit
102, the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 103 and the voltage control
oscillator (VCO) 104. The phase difference signals Pr and Pp, which
cancel out the phase difference between the reference frequency signal
fr and the output frequency signal fp compared with the reference
frequency signal fr are outputted from the charge pump circuit 102
and fed back to the voltage controlled-oscillator (VCO) 104 as the 
control voltage signal Vt through the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit
103. If the frequency of the output frequency signal fp coincides
with that of the reference frequency signal fr, then no phase difference
signals Pr and Pp are outputted and the output frequency signal fp
is locked to the same frequency as that of the reference frequency
signal fr. In order to make faster a lockup time of the low-pass filter
(LPF) circuit 103 here, there is a need to set low the time constant
of the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 103.</p>
    <p num="0004">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 10(1998)-51299
has described a PLL frequency synthesizer circuit including a PLL
synthesizer IC using phase-locked loop, a low-pass filter LPF which
converts the output of the IC to a DC voltage, and a voltage-controlled
oscillator VCO which outputs a frequency corresponding to a control
voltage, wherein switching means for separating the output of a phase
comparator of the PLL synthesizer IC from the LPF prior to timing
provided to turn ON/OFF a source or power supply for a load circuit,
and connecting the output of the phase comparator of the PLL synthesizer
IC to the LPF again is provided.</p>
    <p num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 5(1993)-183432
has described a clock reproducing circuit having a voltage-controlled
oscillator which generates an output signal varied in frequency
according to an input control signal, a phase comparator which compares
the phase of an intermittently applied input signal and that of the
output signal of the voltage-controlled oscillator and sends out its
corresponding phase difference signal, and a first low-pass filter
unit which eliminates unnecessary components in the phase difference
signal, wherein a second low-pass filter unit which takes out a component
corresponding to the difference between the frequency of the input
signal and the free-running frequency of the voltage-controlled
oscillator, and switch/adding means which sends out a signal as the 
control signal obtained by adding the output of the first low-pass
filter unit and the output of the second low-pass filter unit when
the input signal is applied, and sends out the output of the second
low-pass filter unit as the control signal when no input signal is
applied, are added thereto.</p>
    <p num="0006">When the frequency of the output frequency signal fp is locked
to the same frequency as the reference frequency signal fr by the
aforementioned PLL frequency synthesizer 100, the phase difference
signals Pr and Pp of the phase comparator 101 are not outputted as
the average. Even in this state, however, a phase correction pulse
having the same amounts of positive and negative energy is outputted
to the voltage output signal Do produced from the charge pump circuit
102 during an output period of the reference frequency signal fr
corresponding to a phase comparison period in the phase comparator
101 as shown in FIG. 12 (hereinafter called "pseudo correction pulse").
While the present pulse can be eliminated by adjusting the time constant
of the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 103, it has a trade-off relationship
with a lockup characteristic. Namely, if the time constant of the
low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 103 is set high, then the pseudo correction
pulse in the voltage output signal Do can be masked but a lockup time
becomes long. Thus, this does not match the demand for a high-speed
lockup characteristic, thereby causing a problem. If the time constant
of the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 103 is set low in reverse, then
the demand for the high-speed lockup characteristic can be satisfied
but the pseudo correction pulse in the voltage output signal Do cannot
be masked. Thus, spurious outputs are developed, so that C/N is
degraded and communication quality cannot be ensured, thereby causing
a problem. The prior art is accompanied by a problem due to the
possibility that the time constant should unavoidably be adjusted
at a compromise between both characteristics, and the optimum operating 
state cannot be implemented where further speeding-up ahead is viewed.</p>
    <p num="0007">A description will now be made of the reason why the pseudo
correction pulse in the voltage output signal Do is developed. FIG.
13 shows an input/output characteristic of the charge pump circuit
102. The charge pump circuit 102 is a circuit which outputs a voltage
output signal Do proportional to each of input phase difference signals
Δ (Pr and Pp in FIG. 11). The phase difference signal Δ at this
time takes a phase delay of the output frequency signal fp with respect
to the reference frequency signal fr as positive. Thus, when the phase
of the output frequency signal fp is delayed and a positive phase
difference signal Δ is inputted, a positive voltage output signal
Do is outputted and inputted to the voltage-controlled oscillator
(VCO) 104 through the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 103, where the
phase of the output frequency signal fp is advanced, whereby the output
frequency signal fp approaches the reference frequency signal fr so
as to lock. When the phase of the output frequency signal fp leads
and a negative phase difference signal Δ is inputted in reverse, a
negative voltage output signal Do is outputted and inputted to the
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 104 through the low-pass filter
(LPF) circuit 103, where the phase of the output frequency signal
fp is delayed, whereby the output frequency signal fp approaches the
reference frequency signal fr so as to lock. Ideally, the phase
difference signals Δ and the voltage output signal Do need to have
a linear relation (see characteristic straight line L0 in FIG. 13).
In the actual charge pump circuit 102, however, the relationship between
the phase difference signals Δ and the voltage output signal Do in
a small phase-difference region X becomes non-linear due to the time
of a delay in finite signal propagation time of the circuit (see regions
D in characteristic curves L0D in FIG. 13) and hence no voltage output
signal Do is outputted. This small phase-difference region X is called 
a dead or blind zone. Thus, in order to solve the dead zonal region
X, the actual charge pump circuit 102 is generally configured so as
to have nonlinear characteristics obtained by shifting the
characteristics of the phase difference signals Δ and the voltage
output signal Do in the direction to decrease gain as viewed from
the linear characteristic in the dead zonal region X (see characteristic
curves L in FIG. 13). Owing to the provision of such characteristic
curves L, the voltage output signal Do relative to the phase difference
signals Δ has finite gain even in the minute phase-difference region
X, and hence a phase correction pulse is outputted.</p>

aims to prevent the occurrence of a variation in frequency due to
the turning ON/OFF of a power source or supply for a load circuit
and transmit or receive data immediately after the power source is
connected to the load circuit. However, the present publication does
not disclose a technical idea wherein spurious generation in a steady
state of the PLL frequency synthesizer circuit is suppressed while
the time constant of the low-pass filter LPF is being reduced low
and a high-speed lockup characteristic is being improved. Thus, a
problem arises in that a trade-off relation between the two cannot
be solved and both the high-speed lockup characteristic and a low
spurious characteristic at the steady time cannot be realized.</p>

publication does not show a technical idea wherein spurious generation
in a steady state is suppressed while the time constant of the first

    <p num="0011">In order to achieve the above object, a PLL frequency synthesizer
according to one aspect of the present invention comprises a
voltage-controlled oscillator for outputting an output frequency

outputting an output signal corresponding to a phase comparison between
the output frequency signal and a reference frequency signal, and
a charge pump circuit for varying the control voltage signal according
to the phase-compared signal, whereby a feedback loop is configured,
wherein signal flow of the feedback loop is periodically varied in
a phase comparison cycle used in the phase comparator.</p>
    <p num="0012">Thus, the signal flow of the feedback loop can be varied during
the period in which the pseudo correction pulse is outputted from
the charge pump circuit for each phase comparison period or cycle
of the phase comparator. Therefore, the characteristic of response
of the voltage-controlled oscillator to the pseudo correction pulse
outputted from the charge pump circuit can be controlled while the
signal flow of the feedback loop in the steady operating state other
than the pseudo correction pulse output period set for each phase
comparison cycle is being maintained. Further, spurious generation
that occurs due to the pseudo correction pulse can be suppressed in
the steady operating state of the PLL frequency synthesizer. </p>

    <p num="0016">First through fourth embodiments in which PLL frequency
synthesizers of the present invention have been embodied respectively,
will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the
accompanying drawings based on FIGS. 1 through 10.</p>
    <p num="0017">APLL frequency synthesizer according to a first embodiment shown
in FIG. 1 has a configuration wherein a switch circuit 10 controlled
by a control signal Scnt is interposed between a low-pass filter (LPF)
circuit 103 and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 104 in addition
to the function block diagram showing the prior art shown in FIG.
11. In the present embodiment, respective components of a phase
comparator 101, a charge pump circuit 102, a low-pass filter (LPF)
circuit 103 and a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 104 are similar
to the prior art shown in FIG. 11 in their configurations, operations
and effects. Further, the configuration of the PLL frequency
synthesizer 1 wherein a frequency signal fp outputted from the
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 104 is fed back to the phase
comparator 101 so as to constitute a feedback loop, is also similar
to the prior art shown in FIG. 11.</p>
    <p num="0018">In the first embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the switch circuit 
10 is controlled by the control signal Scnt to control the
opening/closing of the feedback loop between the low-pass filter (LPF)
circuit 103 and the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) 104. Namely,
when a feedback loop opening instruction is given according to the
control signal Scnt, the switch circuit 10 is turned off to open up
the feedback loop, thereby making it possible to stop the operation
of the feedback loop. If this stop operation is controlled according
to the control signal Scnt so as to be executed during a period in
which a pseudo correction pulse is outputted from the charge pump
circuit 102 for each phase comparison cycle of the phase comparator
101, then spurious generation incident to the pseudo correction pulse
can be suppressed.</p>
    <p num="0019">In operating waveforms of the PLL frequency synthesizer, which
are shown in FIG. 2, an output frequency signal fp shows a steady
state of being locked into a reference frequency signal fr. A phase
comparing operation at this time is carried out with an output period
or cycle of the reference frequency signal fr as a phase comparison
period or cycle. A pseudo correction pulse is outputted for a voltage
output signal Do of the charge pump circuit 102 with the phase comparing
operation made during the phase comparison period. Thus, the control
signal Scnt is outputted inclusive of the phase comparison period
corresponding to the output period of the reference frequency signal
fr. The switch circuit 10 having received the control signal Scnt
opens the feedback loop to thereby allow the suppression of propagation
of the pseudo correction pulse included in the voltage output signal
Do.</p>
    <p num="0020">Incidentally, the operating waveforms of the PLL frequency
synthesizer 1, which are shown in FIG. 2 are also similar even in
the case of steady states that occur in the second through fourth
embodiment to be described later. Since a change in the signal flow 
of each feedback loop or its operation stop is made inclusive of an
output period of a reference frequency signal fr, corresponding to
a phase comparison period of a phase comparator 101, a pseudo correction
pulse to be outputted from each of charge pump circuits 102 and 40
through 45 during that period can be suppressed or inhibited. Further,
while the signal flow of each feedback loop in a steady operating
state other than a pseudo correction pulse output period is being
held, spurious generation incident to a pseudo correction pulse can
be inhibited in the steady operating state of each of the PLL frequency
synthesizers 2 through 4.</p>
    <p num="0021">In the PLL frequency synthesizer 1 according to the first
embodiment, the switch circuit 10 used as the loop opening/closing
switch circuit is controlled based on the control signal Scnt during
the period in which the pseudo correction pulse is outputted from
the charge pump circuit 102 for each phase comparison cycle of the
phase comparator 101 to open up the feedback loop, thereby making
it possible to stop the operation of the feedback loop. Thus, while
the operation of the feedback loop placed in the steady operating
state other than the pseudo correction pulse output period for each
phase comparison cycle is being maintained, the operation of the
feedback loop relative to the pseudo correction pulse outputted from
the charge pump circuit 102 can be stopped, and the spurious generation
incident to the pseudo correction pulse can be inhibited in the steady
operating state of the PLL frequency synthesizer 1.</p>
    <p num="0022">APLL frequency synthesizer 1A illustrative of a specific example
of the first embodiment, which is shown in FIG. 3, has a configuration
wherein a R frequency divider 105 for dividing a reference frequency
signal by R and an N frequency divider 106 for dividing an output
frequency signal by N are provided in addition to the first embodiment
of FIG. 1, and they respectively input a R-divided frequency signal 
fr and an N-divided frequency signal fp to a phase comparator 101,
where they are subjected to phase comparison. Further, a control
circuit 107, which utilizes both the reference frequency signal used
as a signal inputted to the R frequency divider 105 and a signal outputted
therefrom as input signals, outputs a control signal Scnt to control
a transmission gate 11 comprised of MOS transistors, which indicates
a specific circuit configuration of the switch circuit 10. The present
specific example has a configuration in which in place of the low-pass
filter (LPF) circuit 103 employed in the first embodiment of FIG.
1, a loop filter circuit 12 is provided in a stage antecedent to the
transmission gate 11 and a low-pass filter circuit 13 is provided
in a stage subsequent to the transmission gate 11.</p>
    <p num="0023">The present example is similar to the PLL frequency synthesizer
1 (see FIG. 1) according to the first embodiment in terms of the
configuration wherein the transmission gate 11 is opened so as to
avoid the propagation of a pseudo correction pulse included in a voltage
output signal Do. In the present specific example, the control circuit
107 outputs a control signal Scnt inclusive of an output period of
a pseudo correction pulse while detecting timings provided to start
and complete a phase comparison period, based on the reference frequency
signal used as the input signal of the R frequency divider 105 and
its output signal.</p>
    <p num="0024">Further, the PLL frequency synthesizer 1A is provided with two
filter circuits corresponding to the loop filter circuit 12 and the
low-pass filter circuit 13 interposing the transmission gate 11
therebetween, both of which determine various characteristics such
as the response, stability, etc. relating to signal flow of a feedback
loop. Further, the low-pass filter circuit 13 provided in the stage
subsequent to the transmission gate 11 also has the function of removing
switching noise of the transmission gate 11 and holding a potential 
of a control voltage signal Vt used as the input of a voltage-controlled
oscillator 104 upon the opening of the transmission gate 11. Of the
two filter circuits 12 and 13 in practical use, the loop filter circuit
12 may principally be put in charge of the action of determining the
signal flow of the feedback loop, and the low-pass filter circuit
13 may be put in charge of the function of removing the switching
noise and holding the potential. Since, in this case, the time constant
of the low-pass filter circuit 13 can be set small, a wiring resistance
may be used as an alternative without providing a resistor R2 with
a discrete resistive elemental device.</p>
    <p num="0025">The PLL frequency synthesizer 1A illustrative of the specific
example of the first embodiment controls the transmission gate 11
corresponding to a loop opening/closing switch circuit according to
the control signal Scnt outputted from the control circuit 107 to
open or set free the feedback loop, thereby allowing the stop of the
operation of the feedback loop during a period in which a pseudo
correction pulse is outputted from a charge pump circuit 102 for each
phase comparison period of the phase comparator 101. Thus, the PLL
frequency synthesizer 1A is capable of stopping the operation of the
feedback loop with respect to the pseudo correction pulse outputted
from the charge pump circuit 102 while maintaining the operation of
the feedback loop in a steady operating state other than a pseudo
correction pulse output period set for each phase comparison cycle.
Spurious generation incident to the pseudo correction pulse can be
suppressed in the steady operating state while the time constants
of the loop filter circuit 12 corresponding to the first filter circuit
and the low-pass filter circuit 13 corresponding to the second filter
circuit are being made small to maintain a high-speed lockup
characteristic.</p>
    <p num="0026">Further, since the loop filter circuit 12 and the low-pass filter 
circuit 13 are provided with the transmission gate 11 interposed
therebetween, the two determine various characteristics such as the
response, stability, etc. relating to signal flow of the feedback
loop and are capable of removing switching noise of the transmission
gate 11 and holding a potential of a control voltage signal Vt used
as the input of the voltage-controlled oscillator 104 upon the opening
of the transmission gate 11.</p>
    <p num="0027">A PLL frequency synthesizer 2 according to a second embodiment
shown in FIG. 4 is provided with a low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 20
capable of performing switching to filter characteristics according
to a control signal Scnt as an alternative to the low-pass filter
(LPF) circuit 103 of the PLL frequency synthesizer 100 according to
the prior art shown in FIG. 11. Connectably and disconnectably
providing a resistive elemental device R3 according to a control signal
Scnt in FIG. 4 makes it possible to vary the characteristics of the
low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 20.</p>
    <p num="0028">Figs. 5(A) and 5(B) show specific examples of the low-pass filter (LPF)
circuit 20. FIG. 5(A) is a type wherein parallel paths of resistive
elements employed in a low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 21 are selected
or changed over. When a switch circuit S1 is closed according to a
control signal Scnt, the resistance values of resistive elements for
determining the time constant of the filter result in a resistance
value obtained by connecting resistive elemental devices R4 and R5
in parallel. When the switch circuit S1 is made open according to
the control signal Scnt, the resistance value of the corresponding
resistive element for determining the filter time constant results
in a resistance value of the resistive elemental device R4 alone.
Since a capacitive element corresponding to another component for
determining the filter time constant is fixed as a capacitive elemental
device C4, the filter time constant is determined according to the 
magnitude of the resistance values of the resistive elements. If the
resistance values of the two resistive elemental devices R4 and R5
are assumed to be identical to each other, for example, then the switch
circuit S1 is closed according to the control signal Scnt, and hence
the total resistance value obtained when the two resistive elemental
devices R4 and R5 are connected in parallel, results in substantially
one-half the resistance value where the switch circuit S1 is opened
so that the resistance value is given by the resistive elemental device
R4 alone. Further, the time constant also becomes substantially
one-half.</p>
    <p num="0029">FIG. 5(B) is a type wherein both ends of one resistive elemental
device R6 of two resistive elemental devices R6 and R7 connected in
series are short-circuited and opened to perform switching between
serial paths for resistive elements employed in a low-pass filter
(LPF) circuit 22 shown in FIG. 5(B). When a switch circuit S1 is closed
according to a control signal Scnt, both ends of the resistive elemental
device R6 of the resistive elements for determining a filter time
constant are short-circuited, so that the resistance value is brought
to a resistance value of the resistive elemental device R7 alone.
When the switch circuit S1 is open according to the control signal
Scnt, the resistance values of the resistive elements for determining
the filter time constant result in resistance values of the resistive
elemental devices R6 and R7 connected in series. Since a capacitive
element corresponding to another component for determining the filter
time constant is fixed as a capacitive elemental device C4, the filter
time constant is determined according to the magnitude of the resistance
values of the resistive elemental devices. If the resistance values
of the two resistive elemental devices R6 and R7 are assumed to be
identical to each other, for example, then the resistance value at
the time that the switch circuit S1 is closed according to the control 
signal Scnt and hence both ends of the resistive elemental device
R6 are short-circuited, results in substantially one-half the
resistance value obtained where the switch circuit S1 is opened to
thereby connect the resistive elemental devices R6 and R7 in series.
Further, the time constant also becomes substantially one-half the
time constant in that case.</p>
    <p num="0030">The PLL frequency synthesizer 2 according to the second
embodiment selects a predetermined bypass path from a bypass path
group included in the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 20 by use of a
selector switch circuit S1 during a period in which a pseudo correction
pulse is outputted from a charge pump circuit 102 for each phase
comparison period or cycle of a phase comparator 101 to change a filter
characteristic, thereby making it possible to vary the signal flow
of a feedback loop. As specific examples of the low-pass filter (LPF)
circuit 20, may be considered, the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 21
for performing switching between the parallel paths to thereby select
a predetermined bypass path from a bypass path group, the low-pass
filter (LPF) circuit 22 for performing switching between the serial
paths to select a predetermined bypass path from a bypass path group,
etc. Thus, the characteristic of response of a voltage-controlled
oscillator 104 to the pseudo correction pulse outputted from the charge
pump circuit 102 can be controlled while the signal flow of a feedback
loop in a steady operating state other than a pseudo correction pulse
output period set for each phase comparison period is being maintained.
Selecting a predetermined bypass path large in filter time constant
upon the steady operating state while a predetermined bypass path
small in filter time constant in each of the low-pass filter (LPF)
circuits 20 through 22 is selected and a high-speed lockup
characteristic is maintained upon lockup, allows the suppression of
spurious generation incident to the pseudo correction pulse. </p>
    <p num="0031">A PLL frequency synthesizer 3 according to a third embodiment
shown in FIG. 6 is provided with a low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 30
capable of varying a filter characteristic according to a control
signal Scnt as an alternative to the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit
103 in the PLL frequency synthesizer 100 according to the prior art
shown in FIG. 11.</p>
    <p num="0032">FIG. 7 shows a low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 31 as a specific
example of the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 30. In the low-pass filter
(LPF) circuit 31, a MOS transistor M1 used as an active resistive
elemental device constitutes a resistive element for determining a
filter time constant, and a control signal Scnt is inputted to a gate
terminal thereof. The control signal Scnt applied to the gate terminal
of the MOS transistor M1 is an analog signal and varies an on resistance
of the MOS transistor M1 according to a voltage value to thereby vary
the filter time constant. Since, in this case, a capacitive element
corresponding to another component for determining the filter time
constant is fixed as a capacitive elemental device C5, the filter
time constant can be varied according to the resistance value of the
MOS transistor M1 corresponding to the resistive element.</p>
    <p num="0033">During a period in which a pseudo correction pulse is outputted
from a charge pump circuit 102 for each phase comparison cycle of
a phase comparator 101, the PLL frequency synthesizer 3 according
to the third embodiment controls a variable filter constituent element
in the low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 30 to vary a filter characteristic,
thereby allowing the signal flow of a feedback loop to change. For
example, a low-pass filter (LPF) circuit 31 using a MOS transistor
M1 used as a variable filter constituent element can be used as the
low-pass filter (LPF) circuit30. Thus, the characteristic of response
of a voltage-controlled oscillator 104 to the pseudo correction pulse
outputted from the charge pump circuit 102 can be controlled while 
maintaining the signal flow of the feedback loop in a steady operating
state other than the pseudo correction pulse output period set for
each phase comparison period. While the low-pass filter (LPF) circuits
30 and 31 are reduced in time constant to maintain a high-speed lockup
characteristic upon lockup, the low-pass filter (LPF) circuits 30
and 31 are varied in filter characteristic in a steady operating state
to increase their time constants. Consequently, spurious generation
incident to the pseudo correction pulse can be suppressed.</p>
    <p num="0034">A PLL frequency synthesizer 4 according to a fourth embodiment
shown in FIG. 8 is provided with a charge pump circuit 40 capable
of selecting the supply capability of a voltage output signal Do
according to a control signal Scnt as an alternative to the charge
pump circuit 102 in the PLL frequency synthesizer 100 according to
the prior art shown in FIG. 11.</p>
    <p num="0035">Figs. 9(A), 9(B) and 9(C) show three types of charge pump circuits 41 through
45 as specific examples of the charge pump circuit 40. The charge
pump circuit 41 shown in FIG. 9(A) is a type that it opens or closes
paths for outputting a voltage output signal Do. The charge pump
circuit 41 is one wherein switch circuits S2 and S3 are inserted into
their corresponding paths for supplying a source voltage VDD and a
ground potential to an output-stage circuit B1 for the voltage output
signal Do to thereby control their opening/closing according to a
control signal Scnt. If the operation of opening or setting free the
source voltage VDD and the ground potential is controlled according
to a control signal Scnt so that it is carried out during a period
in which a pseudo correction pulse is outputted from the charge pump
circuit 40 for each phase comparison period of a phase comparator
101, then no source voltage VDD and ground potential are supplied
to the output-stage circuit B1 during the period in which the pseudo
correction pulse is outputted from the charge pump circuit 40, whereby 
the pseudo correction pulse is not outputted.</p>
    <p num="0036">The charge pump circuits 42 and 43 shown in FIG. 9(B) are
respectively types wherein the supply capability of source voltages
to output-stage circuits B2 and B3 of the charge pump circuits 42
and 43 are switched over to thereby perform switching between driving
capability of voltage output signals Do. In the charge pump circuit
42, a switch circuit S4 is controlled according to a control signal
Scnt to switch a supplied source voltage between VDD1 and VDD2, thereby
selecting the corresponding power supply capability. In the charge
pump circuit 43, a value for setting an output voltage to a buffer
circuit B4 for the supply of a source voltage is selected between
voltage dividing resistors R8 through R10 through the use of a switch
circuit S5 to thereby select and change the output voltage, whereby
switching to the driving capability of the output-stage circuit B3
is performed.</p>
    <p num="0037">The charge pump circuits 44 and 45 shown in FIG. 9(C) are
respectively types wherein current supply capability of output-stage
circuits B5, B6 and B7 of the charge pump circuits 44 and 45 are
respectively switched to select driving capability of voltage output
signals Do. In the charge pump circuit 44, a current supply capability
of a current source circuit I1 that defines the supply capability
of a current from a source voltage VDD, is selected according to a
control signal Scnt. In the charge pump circuit 45, a switch circuit
S6 is open/close controlled according to a control signal Scnt to
thereby selectively perform switching to either the use of an
output-stage circuit used for the output of a voltage output signal
Do as an output-stage circuit B6 alone or the addition of an output-stage
circuit B7 to the output-stage circuit B6.</p>
    <p num="0038">During the periods in which the pseudo correction pulses are
outputted from the charge pump circuits 40 through 45 every phase 
comparison periods of the phase comparators 101, the PLL frequency
synthesizer 4 according to the fourth embodiment is capable of switching
the supply capability of the signals outputted from the charge pump
circuits 40 through 45 through the use of the output capability switching
circuits to thereby vary the signal flow of feedback loops respectively.
As specific examples of the output capability switching circuit, there
are known a type (see FIG. 9(A)) wherein the opening and closing of
the paths for the supply of the source voltage VDD and the ground
potential to the output-stage circuit B1 in the charge pump circuit
41 are switched, a type (see FIG. 9(B)) wherein the source voltages
supplied to the output-stage circuits B2 and B3 in the charge pump
circuits 42 and 43 are switched, a type (see FIG. 9(C)) wherein the
current supply capability with respect to the output signals of the
output-stage circuits B5, B6 and B7 in the charge pump circuits 44
and 45 are switched, etc. Thus, the characteristic of response of
a voltage-controlled oscillator 104 to the pseudo correction pulse
outputted from each of the charge pump circuits 40 through 45 can
be controlled while the signal flow of the feedback loop in a steady
operating state other than the pseudo correction pulse output period
for each phase comparison period is being maintained. Further,
spurious generation incident to the pseudo correction pulse can be
suppressed in the steady operating state of the PLL frequency
synthesizer 4.</p>
    <p num="0039">The type (see FIG. 9(A)) for performing switching to the opening

S3 corresponding to the path opening/closing switch circuits during
the period in which the pseudo correction pulse is outputted from
the charge pump circuit 41 for each phase comparison period of the 
phase comparator 101 to open or set free the path for outputting the
voltage output signal Do, corresponding to the output signal path
of the charge pump circuit 41, thereby stopping the operation of the
feedback loop. Thus, while the operation of the feedback loop placed
in the steady operating state other than the pseudo correction pulse
output period set for each phase comparison period is being maintained,
the output of the pseudo correction pulse from the charge pump circuit
41 can be suppressed and spurious generation incident to the pseudo

divider 106, whereby they are phase-compared, has been described as
an illustrative example, the PLL frequency synthesizer according to
the present invention is not limited to it. The PLL frequency
synthesizer may take a configuration wherein no frequency dividers
are used. While the control circuits 107 outputs the control signal
Scnt, based on the reference frequency signal and the frequency signal
fr obtained by dividing the reference frequency signal by R, the present
invention is not limited to it. With the reference frequency signal
as a trigger, the time up to the elapse of a predetermined time may
be taken as an output period of the control signal Scnt, or the control
signal Scnt may be produced based on the output frequency signal or
divided-by-N frequency signal fp, or the control signal Scnt may be
