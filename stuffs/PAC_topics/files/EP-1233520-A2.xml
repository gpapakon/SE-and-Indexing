    <p>The invention relates to phase and frequency-locked loop circuits (PLL and FLL
circuits) with a controllable tracking oscillator whose signal phase relationship or
frequency, respectively, is influenced by an external parametcr, a reference oscillator, as
well as a phase or frequency comparator, the output signal of which is used to control the
tracking oscillator in such a way that any phase or frequency errors are reduced. The
invention provides for an element for the measurement of the external parameter (such as
a microprocessor) which is capable of receiving a signal representing the output signal of

oscillator.

  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The invention relates to phase and frequency-locked loop circuits (PLL and FLL
circuits).</p>
    <p num="0002">PLL and FLL circuits are at present finding a plurality of applications in electronic
circuits for the purpose of synchronising a frequency-controllable tracking oscillator
(usually a voltage-controlled oscillator [VCO]) in either phase or frequency with the
signal of a reference oscillator (such as a crystal-controlled oscillator), whose phase or
frequency, respectively, is virtually constant in comparison with the voltage-controlled
oscillator. The clock frequency generated by the tracking oscillator is thereby greater by
a certain factor (such as 100) than the frequency of the reference oscillator, and is
applied, via a frequency divider, to a phase or frequency comparator, respectively, which
generates the signal for the control of the tracking oscillator. The output signal generated
by the tracking oscillator can then, for example, be used as the system clock signal for a
micro-processor.</p>
    <p num="0003">Apart from the PLL and/or FLL circuits, nowadays a plurality of further circuit
components, to fulfil a variety of functions, are generally also integrated on the same
chip. These may, for example, include circuit components for the measurement of certain
parameters, such as the ambient temperature or a changing supply voltage, and which
make this information available to other circuit components for whose functioning this
information is of significance.</p>
    <p num="0004">The micro-electronics industry is constantly striving to make the best possible use of
the space that is available on a microchip for the sum of the plurality of circuit
components, and to reduce the size of these circuit components to the greatest possible
extent. This requirement has not been met in the best possible way in previous circuits 
containing both a PLL or an FLL circuit, as well as circuits for the measurement of
temperature and/or voltage, respectively.</p>
    <p num="0005">The purpose of the present invention therefore is to provide a PLL or FLL circuit,
respectively, in conjunction with a circuit for the measurement of specific parameters
(such as temperature or supply voltage), that will use less circuit space than previous
embodiment solutions, and that can also be produced more cost-effectively.</p>
    <p num="0006">This requirement is met by a phase-locked loop circuit (PLL circuit) in conjunction
with a controllable tracking oscillator whose signal phase relationship is influenced by an
external parameter, a reference oscillator whose signal phase relationship is constant, as
well as a phase comparator to compare the phase relationship of the signal supplied by
the tracking oscillator with the phase relationship of the signal supplied by the reference
oscillator, and which supplies an output signal characteristic of the phase shift to the
tracking oscillator, with which this will be controlled in such a way that phase errors are
reduced, and where furthermore an element for the monitoring of the external parameter
is provided which is conceived in such a way that it can receive a signal representing the
output signal characteristic of the phase shift, and so change it into a measured value
which represents the real value of the external parameter.</p>
    <p num="0007">Furthermore, this requirement is also met by the use of a frequency-locked loop
circuit (FLL circuit) in conjunction with a controllable tracking oscillator whose
frequency is influenced by an external parameter, a reference oscillator whose frequency
is constant, as well as a frequency comparator which compares the frequency of the
signal supplied by the tracking oscillator with the frequency of the signal supplied by the
reference oscillator, and which supplies an output signal characteristic of the frequency
difference to the tracking oscillator, with which this will be controlled in such a way that
frequency errors are reduced, and where furthermore an element for the monitoring of the
external parameter is provided which is conceived in such a way that it can receive a
signal representing the output signal characterising the frequency shift, and so change it
into a measured value which represents the real value of the external parameter. </p>
    <p num="0008">The invention makes use of the fact that the level of the signal output by the
phase/frequency comparator during the operation of a PLL or FLL control circuit, when
the frequency of the tracking synchroniser is influenced by only one external parameter,
such as the ambient temperature, characterises this parameter, so that the measured value
of the parameter, such as the ambient temperature, can be determined from this with the
help of one further element. The invention therefore integrates the previously used circuit
components for the parameter determination into the PLL or FLL circuit itself and
thereby both reduces production costs as well as the requirement for circuit space as
compared with conventional solutions.</p>
    <p num="0009">The element used to measure the external parameter thereby preferably consists of a
microprocessor. If the tracking oscillator is used to supply the clock pulses for the
microprocessor, there will be no need for any further circuit components to achieve phase
or frequency tracking, as well as the determination of parameters, as compared with
existing conventional methods.Advantageous further developments of the invention are
designated in the sub-claims.</p>
    <p num="0010">The invention shall now by explained in exemplified form with reference to the
drawing, where</p>
    <p num="0011">Fig. 1 shows a PLL circuit according to the invention, with a microprocessor for
the determination of a temperature.</p>
    <p num="0012">Figure 1 represents a preferred embodiment of the invention.</p>
    <p num="0013">The left-hand section of fig. 1 here represents a conventional PLL circuit 1. This
conventional PLL circuit 1 comprises a reference oscillator 2 which, in the present case,
consists of a crystal-controlled oscillator, and a controlled tracking oscillator 3 which, in
the present case, is a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO).</p>
    <p num="0014">The frequency fMCLK of the tracking oscillator 3 is greater by a factor N than the
frequency fACLK of the reference oscillator 2. This will be adapted to the frequency of
the reference oscillator 2 by means of a frequency divider 4 which is connected to the
output of the tracking oscillator 3. </p>
    <p num="0015">Provided is furthermore a phase comparator 6, whose first input is connected to the
output of the reference oscillator and whose second input is connected to the output of
the frequency divider, and which compares the phase of the signal from the reference
oscillator with the phase of the signal from the frequency divider 4, and which outputs an
output signal 7 that is characteristic of the phase shift between the two signals.</p>
    <p num="0016">By means of a digital filter 8, connected to the output of the phase comparator 6, this
output signal 7 is converted into a corresponding digital signal 9, for the purpose of
controlling the controllable tracking oscillator 3 in such a way that the phase shift
becomes zero, and whereby at the same time the condition fMCLK = N * fACLK is
satisfied, that is the frequency of the tracking oscillator 3 then corresponds to the Nth
multiple of the (constant) frequency of the reference oscillator 2.</p>
    <p num="0017">Let it be assumed that the tracking oscillator 3 is embodied in such a way that
changes of the frequency fMCLK that are not caused by the control signal 9 are
essentially the result of influences by an external parameter. In the present example, this
external parameter is assumed to be the ambient temperature T.</p>
    <p num="0018">If the ambient temperature changes, this will cause a change of the frequency fMCLK
of the tracking oscillator 3. This, in turn, causes a corresponding change in the level of
the output signal 7 from the phase comparator 6, and therefore also of the output signal 9
of the digital filter 8, characterising the output signal in digital form. At the same rate as
the temperature changes during the operation of the PLL circuit, there will be a
corresponding change of the output signal from the phase comparator 6 or of the output
signal 9 from the digital filter 9, characterising this output signal in digital form,
respectively.</p>
    <p num="0019">This digital output signal 9 is now also applied to the signal input 11 of a
microprocessor 10, which is embodied in such a way that it can determine the
temperature from the signal characterised by the phase shift and, therefore, the
temperature change.</p>
    <p num="0020">The microprocessor 10 may, for example, keep a lookup table in its memory which
stores the assignment of the digital values output by the digital filter with respect to the 
corresponding temperature values. With the help of this assignment system it becomes
possible to determine on a continuous basis the actual present temperature value by
comparing the digital values of the control signal 9, supplied to the signal input 11 of the
microprocessor, with the values stored in the table.</p>
    <p num="0021">In its preferred version, the microprocessor 10 has furthermore a clock input 12 at
which the output signal of frequency fACLK, as supplied by the reference oscillator 2, is
present. This is of advantage, since the temporal sequencing of the sampling of the
temperature measurement values can be adapted to the corresponding phase comparator 6
and its time schedule at the delivery of the control signal 9. This means that a renewed
sampling process of the temperature measurement value, for example, is only
significantly indicated when a change of the digital control signal has just taken place. If
the change of the digital control signal 9 is controlled by the signal of frequency fACLK,
supplied by the reference oscillator 2, the temporal sequence of the sampling process of
the temperature values is preferentially also controlled by means of this signal. This
means that whenever, for example, the phase comparator 6 outputs a control signal 9 at
the positive slope of the reference oscillator signal, a new sampling value for the
determination of the temperature can be supplied to the microprocessor for evaluation.</p>
    <p num="0022">In another embodiment of the invention, the clock signal of the reference oscillator
can also be used as the microprocessor clock, so that there will be no need for the
microprocessor 10 to have its own clock signal generator.</p>
    <p num="0023">The precise determination of the temperature value can be by means of various
different numerical methods, known in the context of mathematical statistics.</p>
    <p num="0024">It is, for example, possible to store and accumulate a specific number of sampling
values in succession at specified temporal intervals in the memory of the microprocessor
10, in order to compute a mean value of the temperature and, therefore, increase the
precision of the measurement.</p>
    <p num="0025">A sliding average value can also be obtained by replacing the latest value of the
number of sampling values by the most recent sampling value. </p>
    <p num="0026">The tracking synchronisation circuit according to the invention is, of course, not
limited to applications in PLL circuits, but can equally well be used with frequency
tracking synchronisation circuits, where a frequency comparator is provided instead of
the phase comparator shown in Fig. 1.</p>
    <p num="0027">It is, of course, not necessary either that the tracking oscillator should be embodied as
a digitally controlled oscillator, but a conventional voltage controlled oscillator (VCO)
can be used equally well.</p>
    <p num="0028">The external parameter, from which the frequency (or phase, respectively) of the
tracking oscillator depends, must not of necessity be represented by the ambient
temperature either. It can, for example, also be the supply voltage for the tracking
oscillator that essentially influences the frequency or the phase of the tracking oscillator.
In such a case, the microprocessor represented in Fig. 1 would then supply a
measurement value for the supply voltage of the tracking oscillator.</p>
    <p num="0029">Even a digital filter does not, of course, constitute a necessary precondition.
Conceivable is equally well an embodiment where an analogue signal, supplied by a lowpass
filter, is digitised by an analogue-to-digital converter within the microprocessor.</p>
    <p num="0030">It is, of course, also not necessary that the element for the measurement of the
external parameter should consist of a microprocessor, but a logic circuit capable of
generating a measurement value of the parameter from the control signal 9 would be
equally suitable.</p>
