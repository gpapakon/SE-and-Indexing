  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to the use of specific perfluoropolyether
compounds to confer to glass substrata an improved
easy washing or improved washing durability, i.e. multiple
washing cycles resistance. With washing cycles resistance
it is meant the capability of the perfluoropolyether compounds
to remain on the glass surface, nothwithstanding the
high number of performed washings.</p>
    <p num="0002">The use of glass articles for cooking some foods, for
example milk-, sugar-based foods, etc., is known. Said glass
articles, for example ovenproof pyrex dishes, are often
washable with difficulty after the food cooking. The problem
is still more remarked in the case of burnt foods adhering to
the glass subtratum.</p>
    <p num="0003">Generally for the the cleaning of said glass surfaces hot
water and/or detergents are used. The drawback of these
cleaning systems is that they are not very effective, they
require much time, and above all they require, for the
complete removal of the food residues, also the use of steel
sponges which exert an abrasive mechanical action. The
drawback of said abrasive action is to damage the glass 
surface since it causes scratches and also an optical effect
of glass opacification.</p>
    <p num="0004">In USP 5,286,815 the use of hydrogenated polysiloxanes to
obtain antiadherent coatings on various substrata, among which
paper, glass, etc., is described. No experimental proof is
given related to coatings with these compounds on glass
substrata. Therefore, there are no indications as regards the
easy washing and the washing cycles resistance on glass
substrata. Tests carried out by the Applicant, using glass
pyrex dishes available on the market treated with hydrogenated
polysiloxanes, show unsatisfactory results in terms of easy
washing of the glass surface. In fact, to remove the food
residues, it is necessary to use abrasive sponges, wherefore
there are the above drawbacks (see the comparative Examples).</p>
    <p num="0005">It is also known the use of perfluorocarbon silanes in
various applications for the glass treatment. Said compounds
can be polycondensed with other hydrogenated silanes to give
polysiloxanes and they are used in formulations with solvent.
For example, in USP 5,644,014 a fluorosilane is polycondensed
with hydrogenated silanes to obtain a coating composition
having transparence, antiadherence properties to substrata as
glass, metals and plastic. No experimental result is given as
regards the properties to make the glass surfaces easily
washable without using abrasive systems or detergents. </p>
    <p num="0006">USP 5,274,159 describes coating compositions which by
hydrolysis and condensation of the components, give to the
substratum hydro- and oil-repellence properties. The described
compositions comprise fluorinated perfluorocarbon silanes and
can be applied to various substrata, among which textile
fibers, glass, ceramic, metals. Tests carried out by the
Applicant show that by using a formulation comprising the
compound C<sub>8</sub>F<sub>17</sub>(CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>d</sub>NSO<sub>2</sub>N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> described in this patent,
there is a poor resistance to washing cycles, wherefore
the compound applied to the glass substratum shows
performances which decay after 5 washing cycles. Subsequent
uses of the same substratum show that to obtain a complete
glass cleaning also abrasive sponges must be used with the
above drawbacks.</p>
    <p num="0007">In USP 6,033,738, a method is described to give to glass,
ceramic articles etc., high hydro-repellence and high resistance
to abrasion and to atmospheric agents properties. Said
method implies the treatment of the articles with a mixture
formed by a chlorosilane and by a fluorosilane in Si(Cl):Si(F)
concentration in the range 100:0.05-100:50. No experimental
result is given as regards the properties to make the glass
surfaces easily washable without using abrasive systems or
detergents.</p>
    <p num="0008">The need was therefore felt to give glass substrata, in 
particular glass, an improved easy washing and/or improved
washing durability, i.e. multiple washing cycles resistance.</p>
    <p num="0009">The Applicant has surprisingly and unexpectedly found
that the improvement of the above mentioned properties can be
achieved by using particular perfluoropolyethers as defined
hereinafter.</p>
    <p num="0010">An object of the present invention is therefore the use
in the treatment of glass substrata of mono- and bifunctional
(per)fluoropolyethers having the following structures:
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/">R<sub>f</sub>-CFY-L-W</st32:che><st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/">W-L-YFC-O-R<sub>f</sub>-CFY-L-W</st32:che>
wherein:
<sl><li>L is a linking organic group -CO-NR'-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>q</sub>-, with R' = H or
C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> alkyl; q is an integer comprised between 1 and 8, preferably
1-3;</li><li>Y = F, CF<sub>3</sub>;</li><li>W is a -Si(R<sub>1</sub>)<sub>α</sub>(OR<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3-α</sub> group with α = 0, 1, 2, preferably 0,
1;</li><li>R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> equal to or different from each other are C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> alkyl
groups, optionally containing one or more ether O atoms, C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>10</sub>
aryl groups, C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>12</sub> alkyl-aryl or aryl-alkyl groups;</li><li>Rf has a number average molecular weight in the range
350-5,000, preferably 500-3,000 and comprises repeating units
having at least one of the following structures, statistically 
placed along the chain:
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/">(CFXO), (CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>O), (CF(CF<sub>3</sub>)CF<sub>2</sub>O), (CF<sub>2</sub>CF(CF<sub>3</sub>)O),</st32:che>
wherein X = F, CF<sub>3</sub>;</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0011">In particular Rf can have one of the following structures:
<sl><li>1) -(CF<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>a'</sub> - (CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>b'</sub>-

   with a'/b' in the range 0.5-2, extremes included, a' and
b' being integers such to give the above molecular
weight;</li><li>2) -(C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>O)<sub>r</sub>-(C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>O)<sub>b</sub>-(CFXO)<sub>t</sub> -

   with r/b = 0.5-2.0; (r+b)/t is in the range 10-30,
b, r and t being integers such as to give the above
molecular weight, X has the above meaning;</li><li>3) -(C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>O)<sub>r</sub>,-(CFXO)<sub>t</sub>, -

   t' can be 0;

   when t' is different from 0 then r'/t' = 10-30,

   r' and t' being integers such as to give the above
molecular weight; X has the above meaning.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0012">In the above mentioned formulas:

-(C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>O)- can represent units of formula
<st32:che xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/">- (CF(CF<sub>3</sub>)CF<sub>2</sub>O)- and/or - (CF<sub>2</sub>-CF(CF<sub>3</sub>)O)-.</st32:che></p>
    <p num="0013">In structure (I) wherein the compound is monofunctional,
the end group of R<sub>f</sub> is of the T-O- type, wherein T is a
(per)fluoroalkyl group selected from: -CF<sub>3</sub>, -C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>5</sub>, -C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>7</sub>, 
-CF<sub>2</sub>Cl, -C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>Cl, -C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>Cl; optionally one or two F atoms,
preferably one, can be replaced by H.</p>
    <p num="0014">Mixtures of the above mentioned compounds (I) and (II) are
preferably used.</p>
    <p num="0015">As preferred perfluoropolyether compounds of formula (II)
those having R<sub>f</sub> of structure (1) are used; as preferred perfluoropolyether
compounds of formula (I) those having R<sub>f</sub> of
structure (3) are used.</p>
    <p num="0016">It has been found that by using the compounds of the invention
of formula (I) an easy washing of the glass surface is
obtained superior to that given by the hydrogenated polysiloxanes
used in the prior art for the glass treatment. The
compounds of formula (I) have a good resistance to washing
cycles up to 8-9 cycles.</p>
    <p num="0017">It has been found that by using the compounds of the invention
of formula (II) an easy washing of the glass surface
is obtained superior to that given by the hydrogenated
polysiloxanes of the prior art, but slightly lower than that
of the compounds of formula (I). Besides, the compounds of
formula (II) give the further advantage not to be removed even
after a high number of washing cycles (over 10), wherefore the
treatment effect results prolonged in the time.</p>
    <p num="0018">The Applicant has found that by using in admixture the
compounds of formula (I) and (II), a better easy washing is 
obtained combined with a greater resistance to washing cycles.
In this case an admixture is used having a ratio by weight
between the compound of structure (I) and that of structure
(II) in the range 10:1-1:1, preferably 5:1-2:1.</p>
    <p num="0019">The bifunctional fluoropolyethers of formula (II) are
obtainable by well known processes in the prior art, see for
example the following patents herein incorporated by reference:
USP 3,847,978 and EP 374,740 for preparing compounds with
acid end groups of -COF type. The silane end group of formula
(II) can be obtained by transformation of the -COF group into
the -COOR ester group wherein R = alkyl, preferably C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12</sub>, and
subsequent ester reaction according to the processes for
example mentioned in USP 3,810,874. In particular, see USP
5,714,637, USP 4,094,911, USP 4,818,619. To increase the
content of the bifunctional acid compounds the keto-acid
described in USP 3,847,978 can be treated with bases obtaining
a mixture of carboxylic acids and polyethers having -CF<sub>2</sub>H end
groups. If the pure bifunctional derivative of formula (II) is
desired, further purification steps, for example distillation
or chromatography can be carried out.</p>
    <p num="0020">The monofunctional compounds of formula (I) are obtainable
according to the methods indicated in EP 374,740, and subsequent
transformation of the -COF groups into silane end groups
according to the same methods mentioned for the bifunctional 
compounds of formula (II).</p>
    <p num="0021">Examples of glass substrata for which the treatment of the
invention has given positive results, are ovenproof pyrex
dishes and pots and kitchen containers in general.</p>
    <p num="0022">The (per)fluoropolyether compounds of the invention can be
applied by spin-coating, dipping, brushing, spraying, padding,
preferably by spin-coating, dipping.</p>
    <p num="0023">The compounds of the invention are applied by using
formulations with solvent, solvent-water admixtures or
prevailingly aqueous formulations. The solvents can be polar
or apolar. Among apolar solvents, fluorinated solvents or
hydrocarbon solvents can for example be mentioned. Examples of
fluorinated solvents are perfluoropolyether,
hydroperfluoropolyether and perfluorocarbon solvents.
Hydrocarbon solvents are selected among the linear or branched
aliphatic ones.</p>
    <p num="0024">The polar solvents are selected from the following classes:
aliphatic alcohols having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; aliphatic
glycols having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms, optionally
having an esterified hydroxyl; ketones or esters having from
3 to 10 carrbon atoms, etc.</p>
    <p num="0025">In the above formulations the concentration of the
(per)fluoropolyethers of formula (I) and (II) is generally in
the range 0.1-10% by weight, preferably 0.5-2.5% by weight. 
The amount of (per)fluoropolyether compound applied to the
glass substratum surface is such as to obtain thin coatings
having a thickness generally in the range 0.01-1 µm, preferably
0.05-0.3 µm.</p>
    <p num="0026">In the used formulation also an hydrolysis catalyst of the
silane group can be present, such as an acid or a base. As
acids, phosphates or perfluoropolyether carboxylates or other
acids such as for example acetic acid, hydrochloric acid and
nitric acid can be used.</p>
    <p num="0027">As basic catalysts for the crosslinking of the compounds
of the invention, ammonia and aliphatic or aromatic amines can
be used. In the formulation an amount of water can be
introduced to favour the hydrolysis reactions and the
condensation of the perfluoropolyether silanes.</p>
    <p num="0028">After the application of the formulation containing the
perfluoropolyether silanes of the invention, a thermal
treatment of the glass surface can be carried out at a
temperature in the range 60-250°C, preferably 80-200°C for a
time ranging from 1 to 60 minutes, preferably 10-30 minutes.
Such thermal treatment allows a quick evaporation of the
solvent and favours the further polycondensation of the
perfluoropolyether silanes. When one wants to avoid the
thermal treatment it is necessary the presence of the above
mentioned acid or basic catalysts in the used formulation. 
Besides in this case it is necessary to wait for at least 24
hours to obtain the crosslinking of the compounds of the
invention.</p>
    <p num="0029">The compounds of the invention can furthermore be applied
also to window glasses, in particular to the side exposed to
atmospheric agents.</p>
    <p num="0030">Another possible application of the compounds of the invention
is that regarding the treatment of screens, for example
of computers, television sets, etc. In this case a lower
dirt pick up of the screen, in particular a lower anti-print
effect has been noticed. This is particularly desired, since
it is preferred to carry out the lowest number of washings as
possible not to damage the electric parts of the system with
the used solvent.</p>
    <p num="0031">The present invention will be better illustrated by the
following Examples, which have a merely indicative but not
limitative purpose of the scope of the invention itself.</p>

    <p num="0033">To evaluate the adherence and the permanence degree of the
formulation applied to the slide before and after the food
deposition, a measurement of the dynamic contact angle by the
SIGMA70 (KSV) instrument is carried out. The advancing contact 
angle (Θ<sub>a</sub>) towards water is measured at the temperature of
20°C.

It is known that fluorinated surfaces show a low surface
energy and consequently they are scarcely wetted by water
(dynamic contact angle higher than 100°C). In the case of
untreated glass substrata there is a quite complete
wettability from water (contact angle lower than 30°C).</p>
