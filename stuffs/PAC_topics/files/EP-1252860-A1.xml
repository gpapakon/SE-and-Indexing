      <u style="single">Background of the Invention</u>
    </heading>
    <heading>1. Field of the Invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to devices for monitoring cardiac function in
animals, and more particularly to such monitoring apparatus which employ components
implanted in the animal.</p>
    <heading>2. <u style="single">Description of the Related Art</u></heading>
    <p num="0002">Patients with coronary disease often require monitoring in order to detect
changes in their heart function. For example, cardiologists often are interested in cardiac
output which is the amount of blood pumped from the heart during each cycle. The
cardiac output can be determined from detecting the change in volume as the heart
contracts. In other cases, it is desirable to detect movement of various portions of the
heart to determine whether the heart muscles are functioning properly.</p>
    <p num="0003">Most procedures for monitoring cardiac activity and motion employ complex
imaging of the heart using ultrasound, radio isotopes or magnetic resonance imaging
apparatus and require that the patient go to a facility with the proper imaging equipment,</p>
    <p num="0004">As a consequence, it is desirable to provide an apparatus which can monitor
heart motion without the use of special facilities. There also is a desire to be able to
observe blood flow through coronary arteries and monitor cardiac output on a continuous
basis. </p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">Summary of the Invention</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0005">An apparatus for monitoring activity of an organ. such as the heart. in an
animal comprises a transmitter for wirelessly sending an interrogation signal through the
animal. One or more passive transponders, adapted to be attached to the organ, produce
a reaction in response to receipt of the interrogation signal. In the preferred embodiment,
that reaction comprises sending a reply signal wirelessly through the animal. A receiver
detects the reaction of each transponder and a controller determines a characteristic of
the organ based on the reaction of each transponder.</p>
    <p num="0006">For example, the position of each transponder, and thus the position of that
part of the organ in which the transponder is located, can be determined by analyzing the
intensity or relative time of receipt of the reply signals. The positions of the respective
transponders then can be used to derive the volume of the organ and volume changes
over time can be observed as in the case of a beating heart. Sensors also may be
connected to the transponders to measure a physical characteristic of the organ and
send information about that characteristic via the reply signal.</p>

    <heading>
      <u style="single">Detailed Description of the Invention</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0014">Figure 1 shows an apparatus 10 for monitoring performance of a heart 11
within a patient wherein the heart has blood vessels 12 which supply blood to the heart
muscles. It should be understood that although the present invention is being described
in the context of monitoring the heart, it can be use to monitor other organs. Four radio
frequency transponders 14, 16, 18 and 20 are attached to the outer surface of the heart 11
using sutures, adhesive or similar mechanisms. Transponder 20 is located on the rear
surface of the heart. As seen in Figure 2, the four transponders 14-20 are not located in
the same plane and thus their positions can be represented as the apexes of a tetrahedron.
Additional transponders can be placed on the heart, in which case a polyhedron with
more apexes would be formed. The transponders 14-20 move with the exterior surface
as the heart beats and the size of the tetrahedron changes with changes in the heart size. </p>
    <p num="0015">Referring to Figure 4, the circuitry for the transponders 14, 16, 18 and 20
is mounted on a flexible substrate that has conductors for interconnecting the circuit
components. The transponders 14, 16, 18 and 20 are passive devices, which as used
herein means that the transponders do not have an internal power source, such as a
battery, and instead are powered by energy of a radio frequency interrogation signal
received by the transponder. Each passive transponder 14-20 contains an antenna 30
which is connected a radio frequency transceiver 32. The transponders 14-20 are tuned
to different frequencies, thereby enabling each one to be accessed independently. Upon
receiving a signal at the proper radio frequency, the transceiver 32 transfers the radio
frequency signal back to the antenna 30. In this embodiment, the passive transponder
merely echoes the received signal and does not convert it either in terms of frequency
mor content. However, in an alternative embodiment, the transceiver 32 may shift the
frequency so that the reply signal is at a different frequency than that of the received
signal.</p>
    <p num="0016">The passive Transponders 14-20 are accessed periodically by an interrogator
40. The interrogator preferably is implanted inside the patient, but may be outside the
patient and firmly held in place during the examination process. Implantation of the
interrogator is preferred as the location of the interrogator relative to the transponders
is important for measuring certain cardiac parameters and variation of that position
adversely affects an ability to compare measurements taken over time.</p>
    <p num="0017">Figure 5 shows the circuitry of a typical interrogator 40 which has a controller
42 that determines when to interrogate the transponders and processes the information
from such interrogation. When interrogation is desired, the controller 42 sends a 
command to a signal generator 44 which instructs a transmitter 46 to select one of the
frequencies to which a transponder is tuned. The signal generator 44 also generates a
sequence of pulses that cause the transmitter 46 to emit bursts of the selected radio
frequency signal. The output of the transmitter 46 is sent to an antenna 48 which emits
the signal into the chest of the patient.</p>
    <p num="0018">Referring again to Figure 4, if a particular passive transponder is tuned to the
frequency of the signal sent from the interrogator 40, that transponder's transceiver 32
will echo a reply signal via antenna 36. That reply signal will be delayed slightly so that
it does not overlap the original signal sent from the interrogator.</p>
    <p num="0019">The interrogator 40 in Figure 5 has three antennas 50, 51 and 52 positioned at
different locations with respect to the patient's heart for receiving the transponder reply
signals. Each antenna 50, 51 and 52 is connected to a separate receiver 53, 54, or 55
respectively which at this time are all tuned to the frequency at which the interrogator had
just transmitted a signal. Each receiver 53-55 responds to signals in a band frequencies
centered about that tuned frequency so that reply signals with minor frequency shifts
still will be detected. The intensity and exact frequency of the received reply signal are
determined by each receiver 53-55 and that information is fed to the controller 42 for
initial storage.</p>
    <p num="0020">The intensity of the echoed reply signal varies as beating heart causes a
transponder 14-20 to move with respect to the interrogator 40. Specifically the signal
intensity varies with twice the square of the distance between the transponder and
the interrogator. Thus changes in the intensity indicate relative movement of the
transponder. Alternatively, the time delay between the transmission of the original 
signal burst from the interrogator 40 and receipt of the reply signal at each receive
antenna 50-52 can be used as an indicator of the distance between that transponder
and the interrogator 40. By knowing the distance between the transponder 14-20 and
each receiver antenna 50-52, triangulation can be employed to determine the position
of the transponder and thus that part of the heart to which the transponder is attached.</p>
    <p num="0021">The interrogator 40 sequentially addresses each passive transponder 14-20
by emitting interrogation signals of the corresponding frequencies. At the same time,
the tuning of the receivers 53-55 in the interrogator is changed to the new transmission
frequency. In this manner, the interrogator 40 acquires information about the intensity
and frequency shift of each reply signal echoed by the respective transponders.</p>
    <p num="0022">Depending upon the sophistication of the controller 42. the transponder signal
information merely may be stored in a memory for downloading to an external computer
for evaluation, or the controller 42 may be programmed to evaluate the data internally. In
either case, a data link 54 is provided to transfer either the raw data or the data processing
results to an external device. For example, if the interrogator 40 is implanted in the
patient, the data link 54 can be a coil implanted immediately under the skin of the
patient. That coil can be electromagnetically coupled to an external coil to exchange
data between the implanted interrogator 40 and an external computer (not shown) using
communication techniques similar to those employed to exchange data with an implanted
heart pacing device.</p>
    <p num="0023">A sophisticated interrogator 40 is able to determine the relative change in the
position of the transponders 14-20 from the change in their signal intensities. Specifically,
as the transponder moves closer to a receive antenna 50-52 of the interrogator 40, the 
intensity of that transponder signal will increase. Conversely when the transponder is
moving away from the receive antenna 50-52, the intensity of the reply signal decreases.
Therefore. the controller 42 is able to determine the position of each transponder and
from that position information determine the size of the tetrahedron formed by the four
transponders 14-20 as shown in Figure 2. The heart 11 can be modeled as a sphere 22
with the four transponders 14-20 located on the surface of that sphere. as shown in Figure
3, and the volume of the sphere can be determined by the controller 42 .</p>
    <p num="0024">Change in the size of the sphere from one interrogation cycle to the next
corresponds to the change in the volume of the heart, which then can be used to
determine cardiac function. The relative motion of each of the transponders also
indicates whether all portions of the heart muscle are functioning properly.</p>
    <p num="0025">More complex analysis of the transponder signals can be preformed. The
motion of a transponder is characterized by both velocity and direction and thus can be
represented mathematically as a vector. Thus, the motion of the set of four transponders
14-20 can be expressed as a set of vectors, with a set being created each time the four
transponders are interrogated. Motion of the entire heart can be quantified in the form
of mappings or correspondence from one set of these vectors to another, thus forming a
tensor. This tensor is a characterization of the heart activity.</p>
    <p num="0026">With reference to Figure 6, alternatively a passive transponder 60 can be
formed by placing its circuitry 62 onto the surface of a vascular stent 64. Such stents are
commonly used to enlarge narrowed blood vessels to improve the fluid flow. The stent
is an expandable device which is placed in collapsed form around a balloon catheter that
then is threaded through the blood vessels typically into an artery of the heart. Once 
properly positioned, the balloon of the catheter is inflated which also enlarges the stent
against the walls of the blood vessel thereby firmly implanting the transponder 60 at that
location in the blood vessel.</p>
    <p num="0027">Although the circuit 62 of the passive transponder on the stent 64 can merely
reflect the radio frequency signal back to the interrogator 40 as described previously, the
stent transponder also can sense physiological parameters of the patient and modify the
reflected signal in response to that sensing. In this manner data about the patient's
physiology are sent to the interrogator which utilizes that information to analyze cardiac
performance. For example, the sensors may detect characteristics related to the blood
flow or electrical signals produced in the heart. That sensed physiological information
then modifies one or more electrical parameters of the transponder, such as by varying a
resistor, capacitor or inductor, which alters characteristics of the reflected radio frequency
signal to encode the sensed information.</p>
    <p num="0028">Figure 7 illustrates more complex sensing circuitry for a stent based
transponder 62. That transponder has a receiving antenna 70 connected to a transceiver
72 which is tuned to a particular frequency designated for this transponder. The received
radio frequency signal provides energy for powering the passive transponder as is
typically done with many types of transponders for other applications, such as for
unlocking doors of a building. Thus, part of the electrical energy received by the
transceiver 72 is diverted to a power supply 74 which provides energy for powering a
signal processor 76 within the stent. Upon being powered, the processor 76 reads
information from one or more sensors 78 and 80. For example, the sensors 78 and 80
may measure pressure in the blood vessel at opposite ends of the stent 64. These 
measurements denote a pressure drop across the stent. and thus provide an indication
when the stent is closing.</p>
    <p num="0029">A common problem with stents is that material begins to form inside the
stent, thereby reducing the blood flow there through. Such narrowing of the stent can be
detected by sensing the pressure drop across the stent which increases as the blood flow
is restricted. Thus too great a pressure drop provides an indication to medical personnel
that the stent needs to be replaced or cleaned out.</p>
    <p num="0030">In addition. the absolute pressure in the blood vessel 12 at the stent is useful
information regarding the adequacy of blood flow to that location in the heart. Other
types of sensors can be connected to the processor 76 to determine the relative flow of
blood through the vein, the temperature of that portion of the heart, and other physical
characteristics.</p>
    <p num="0031">The processor 76 obtains and sends the sensor data to a transmitter section
of the transceiver 72 which modulates a radio frequency carrier with that sensor
information. The frequency of the carrier emitted by transceiver 72 preferably has
the same frequency as the signal received from the interrogator 40. The resultant
modulated radio frequency signal is transmitted by antenna 70 back to the interrogator
40.</p>
    <p num="0032">In this version where sensor data is modulated on the reply signal from the
transponders, the interrogator 40 recovers that modulated data for storage and subsequent
analysis. The data also may be provided for processing by computer external to the
patient's body via the data link 54 of the interrogator. </p>
    <p num="0033">The stent 60 becomes distorted as the heart beats. The forces exerted on the
blood vessel 12 and the flow of fluid through the vessel cause a distortion of the stent
which in turn varies the characteristics of the antennas 70 and 84. This results in a
corresponding change in the frequency of the reply signal. As a consequence. the
distortion of the stent as represented by the frequency change can be employed to
indicate forces acting at that point in the heart</p>
    <p num="0034">The foregoing description was primarily directed to a preferred embodiment
of the invention. Although some attention was given to various alternatives within the
scope of the invention. it is anticipated that one skilled in the art will likely realize
additional alternatives that are now apparent from disclosure of embodiments of the
invention. For example, although the present invention was described in the context of
radio frequency signals being used. other types of signals could be employed.
Furthermore, reaction of a transponder to receiving an interrogation signal may be other
then by transmitting a reply signal. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be
determined from the following claims and not limited by the above disclosure.</p>
