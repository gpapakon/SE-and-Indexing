  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <heading>Field of the invention</heading>
    <p num="0001">The invention relates to a protein having multiple
antigen/epitope sequences and being immobilized, to
a polynucleotide coding for such a protein, to an
expression vector including such polynucleotide, to
a cell transformed by means of such an expression
vector, and to applications of such a protein for
producing an immobilizate and for performing a HIV
test.</p>
    <heading>Background of the invention</heading>
    <p num="0002">Immobilizates comprising a solid phase and one or
more proteins bound to the solid phase are well
known by practical experiences. Such immobilizates
are used, on one hand, for the detection of substances
of a liquid analyzate specifically binding
to the protein, and on the other hand for the separation
of such substances from a liquid. Therein
the protein comprises an epitope being specific for
the substance to be detected or to be separated,
and this epitope normally binds to the solid phase
by a spacer composition per se not binding to the
substance. The spacer composition secures, among
other effects, that the protein folds in the area
of the epitope in a way corresponding to the folding
of a native epitope. This, i.e. the desired exposure
of the epitope, is the condition for that a
binding of the substance is at all possible. In
particular, the formation of undesired disulfide
bridges is prevented. </p>
    <p num="0003">In some fields of medicine, it is desirable that
various epitopes are immobilized at the same time
at the solid phase. This is desirable, for instance,
in the case of HIV tests, since only an accumulation
of epitopes being specific for antibodies
for various HIV1 and HIV2 viruses and sub-types
will secure a reliable decision on the basis of the
test result about whether or not the tested sample
contains HIV antibodies, i.e. whether or not a person
is HIV positive.</p>
    <p num="0004">In principle, the respective proteins, for instance
antigens against various HIV antibodies, could be
immobilized each for its own at the solid phase.
This presents however various problems. The first
problem is that a uniform distribution of the proteins,
in particular with regard to concentrations,
and thus a sufficiently uniform sensitivity for the
various antibodies cannot be secured. For various
proteins may lead to ousting reactions at the solid
phase, with the consequence of substantially disturbing
concentration differences at the solid
phase, even with equimolar addition. Further, with
a higher multitude of different proteins, interactions
of the various proteins during immobilization
cannot be excluded. All this will disturb, however,
if a universal test, for instance for HIV, is to be
established. The above will apply in a corresponding
manner, of course, to all diseases causing, depending
from the classes and sub-types of the infecting
organism, immunologically distinguishable
antibodies in a body. It is understood that different
antibodies against a specific sub-type may also
be formed.</p>
    <p num="0005">In conjunction with HIV, the following is to be
noted. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) is caused by the HIV. The two causative
types HIV-1 and HIV-2 detected up to now have a
very similar genome structure and infect T cells 
using a very similar mechanism. They immunologically
differ, however, by that antibodies against
HIV-1 do not usually present a cross reaction with
HIV-2, and vice versa. For HIV-1, further, a series
of sub-types are distinguished, with the group M
comprising several sub-types (A, B, C, D, E, F and
G), and the sub-type O being classified in an own
group (O). Even between the antibodies against different
sub-types there are immunological differences.
It is difficult, therefore, to reliably detect
in a single test system all sub-types or antibodies
thereagainst. This particularly applies to
rapid tests having to be performed without too
large experimental expenses. In a rapid test, a reliable
result should be obtainable with a single
application for instance of a blood sample. In particular
in conjunction with HIV, incorrect negative
and incorrect positive results must virtually be
impossible.</p>
    <heading>State of the art</heading>
    <p num="0006">Exemplary for the application of one or more antigens
in a mixture against various HIV antibodies is
the document US-A-5,830,641.</p>
    <p num="0007">Rapid tests known up to now usually operate, however,
with one single antigen, namely gp41, and are
not capable, therefore, to detect all HIV sub-types
reliably and at high sensitivity. There is thus a
substantial risk of incorrect negative results.
Further, they are not temperature-stable over
longer periods of time, not suitable for permanent
documentation, do not secure a simple and safe disposal,
and present an incorrect positive result in
case of over-development.</p>
    <p num="0008">Fusion proteins having more than one epitope for
HIV antibodies are <i>per se</i> known in the art, for instance 
from the documents US-A-5,800,822 and US-A-5,310,876.
These are proteins used in a solution
for laboratory tests. Such laboratory test systems
are not suitable, however, for rapid tests, due to
the complicated handling and the high risk of incorrect
results during execution caused by not
properly educated persons.</p>
    <p num="0009">From the document US-A-4,925,784 is known a fusion
protein gag/env which may also be immobilized.
Bridge compositions with binding sites for a binding
with a solid phase between gag and env cannot
be taken out. The fusion protein binds at one side
over a bridge to a solid phase.</p>
    <p num="0010">From the document DE 197 20 914 A1 are known in the
art various antigens against antibodies of different
sub-types. The antigens may bind to a solid
phase. Different antigens are used as a mixture. As
far as antigens with multiple epitopes are concerned,
they are haptens, i.e. proteins with multiple
sequences of a single epitope type.</p>
    <p num="0011">The document US-A-5,241,047 describes peptides reacting
with serums of HIV-positive human guinea
pigs. Various epitopes are coupled immediately side
by side and may bind by a spacer sequence at the C
or N-terminal end to a solid phase. By means of a
spacer sequence, spacing of a signal sequence from
a carrier material is achieved. One end of the
spacer sequence binds to the carrier material, and
the other end to an end of the signal sequence. To
each spacer sequence is coupled one signal sequence
only.</p>
    <heading>Technical object of the invention</heading>
    <p num="0012">The invention is based on the object to specify an
immobilizable protein, which can be used for a
rapid test of the presence of antibodies in a patient's 
sample and reliably permits in such a rapid
test a detection of many to all groups and sub-types
of a causative agent or of antibodies thereagainst.</p>
    <heading>Principles of the invention</heading>
    <p num="0013">As a solution for this technical object, the invention
teaches a protein having multiple antigen/epitope
sequences for antibodies, the protein being
immobilized at a solid phase by at least one binding
site, and the antigen/epitope sequences being
spaced by bridge compositions in such a way that
after binding of the binding site at the solid
phase the antigen/epitope sequences are exposed for
a binding of the assigned antibodies from the liquid
phase.</p>
    <p num="0014">The invention is based on a combination of findings.
A first finding is that the disadvantages of
the application of a mixture of antigens can be
avoided by that the antigen/epitopes are combined
in a single protein. Then an immobilization can
easily take place, without different affinities to
the solid phase and/or interactions of different
antigens between each other leading to disturbing
displacements of the distributions. Then the invention
is based on the further finding that it will
not be sufficient to just line-up different epitopes
and to then bind the product at one end (or
both ends) to the solid phase. Rather, it has to be
achieved that the epitopes are exposed in a desired
manner after the immobilization, i.e. form a secondary
and maybe a tertiary structure securing a
binding of the assigned antibodies and further permitting
a sterical accessibility. Finally, it has
been found that this can be achieved by establishing
bridge compositions between the epitopes causing
on one hand the binding to the solid phase and 
providing on the other hand the desired exposure.
The concept is thus basically the generation of a
single protein with several spaced epitopes in turn
being separated by interposition of bridge compositions.
Further, by adequate selection of the bridge
compositions, in particular the structures of the
parts of the respective bridge compositions extending
on either side of an epitope up to the both-sides
binding sites at the solid phase, the epitopes
can be folded in a defined way, such that the
exposure is reliably secured and also fixed. Finally,
it is inherent to the concept of the invention
that disturbing interactions of different epitopes
of a protein are virtually excluded.</p>
    <p num="0015">Suitable bridge compositions can easily be calculated,
based on the epitope structures or sequences
flanking such connections, by using the principles
of molecular modeling. Additionally or alternatively,
the average man skilled in the art can experimentally
test various bridge compositions for
suitability, by that the binding capability of antibodies
to the epitopes flanking the bridge compositions
are tested by conventional methods.</p>
    <p num="0016">It is understood that a protein according to the
invention must have ends. One end may be the end of
an epitope being neither directly nor indirectly
bound to the solid phase. One end may further be an
end of a bridge composition, the end of the bridge
composition being the binding site or, referred to
the connected epitope, may be placed beyond the
binding site. One end may finally also be formed by
a tag, in particular an affinity tag.</p>
    <p num="0017">In principle, there are various possibilities to
create a protein according to the invention. For
instance, a bridge composition may be formed by insertion
of bridge sequences between two antigen/epitope
sequences and/or deletion of a partial sequence 
between two antigen/epitope sequences arranged
in a total sequence. The bridge composition
may also be formed by fusion of a bridge sequence
with two antigen/epitope sequences.</p>
    <p num="0018">Bridge compositions may be various molecules. Basically,
any organic substances, typically chain type
connections, may be used. Examples are oligomers on
the basis of identical or different monomers of the
polymeric chemistry. It is preferred to form the
bridge composition by amino acids. The bridge composition
must comprise a binding site for the solid
phase. Usually, a positively charged binding site
for the binding to a negatively charged solid
phase, preferably a membrane, is provided.</p>
    <p num="0019">Basically, the antigen/epitope sequences may be
identical within a protein. It is particularly preferred,
however, if the antigen/epitope sequences
bind different antibodies. In an ideal manner, such
different antigen/epitope sequences in a protein
according to the invention or in a few proteins according
to the invention are combined with each
other, so that antibodies of the most usual (better
all) sub-types of a species of causative agents are
detected. The antigen/epitope sequences may for instance
be repetitive sequence elements of identical
or different HIV sub-types. It is preferred, however,
if the antigen/epitope sequences are sequences
of different HIV genes and/or strains
and/or sub-types.</p>
    <p num="0020">In principle, the bridge composition may be formed
of any sequence, the bridge composition being for
instance a sequence element of gp120. It is preferred
if partial sequences unspecifically binding
to antibodies contained in blood are deleted. This
applies with regard to the bridge composition as
well as to the antigen/epitope sequences. </p>
    <p num="0021">The invention further relates to the application of
proteins according to the invention for producing
an immobilizate for the detection of antibodies,
wherein first the protein is produced in a dissolved
manner, then the protein being bound by at
least one binding site to a solid phase, and as an
option the solid phase with the protein bound
thereto being subjected to at least one rinsing
step and/or blocking step, and to the application
of a protein according to the invention for performing
a HIV test, an immobilizate according to
the invention being produced and said immobilizate
being placed in a housing, and a detector solution
being brought-in in a reaction zone of the immobilizate
or being separately added for application to
the immobilizate.</p>
    <p num="0022">The invention further relates to a polynucleotide,
in particular cDNA, coding for a protein according
to the invention, an expression vector, preferably
plasmide, containing a polynucleotide sequence coding
for a protein according to the invention, and a
cell being transformed by means of an expression
vector according to the invention.</p>
    <p num="0023">Finally, the invention relates to a method for the
production of a protein according to the invention,
the antigen/epitope sequences and the bridge sequences
being selected and the order of the lining-up
being defined, wherein DNA coding for the antigen/epitope
sequences and the bridge sequences is
subsequently inserted into an expression vector in
the defined manner and under application of a suitable
promoter, a cell, preferably E. coli, being
transformed by means of the expression vector and
transformed cells being selected and cultivated,
and wherein the protein expressed from the selected
cells is isolated. </p>
    <p num="0024">A HIV test according to the invention basically has
the following structure. In a "flow through" version,
a porous material, in most cases a membrane,
is in a device, for instance a plastic housing having
an access opening to the membrane. At surfaces
of the membrane being accessible to liquids, at
least one protein type according to the invention
is immobilized. Through the access opening, a sample
to be tested, for instance blood, serum or
plasma, is applied on the membrane. Among other
reasons, because of the capillary forces the sample
will enter into the membrane or will pass through
it. This can further be supported, for instance, by
placing an absorbent material under the membrane.
The sample or antibodies contained therein, respectively,
react with the protein. By applying a conventional
detector solution, for instance colored
particles such as colloidal gold particles, a visual
proof for the binding of antibodies to the protein
is achieved. Alternatively to the "flow
through" technology, a "lateral flow" method can be
used. Therein a membrane is used, too, being however
separated in a lateral direction into an application
zone and a reaction zone. Caused by the
capillary effect, the sample applied in the application
zone will pass into the reaction zone where
at least one protein type according to the invention
is immobilized. In the application zone, there
will be no proteins according to the invention immobilized,
it is however possible to immobilize
other substances, e.g. proteins, not binding the
antibodies to be detected, however binding substances
not desired in the sample and thus separating
them. Thereby the reliability of the antibody
detection is substantially improved, since undesired
interactions because of other blood components
can be excluded. The reaction zone may already
contain a detector substance, however it may 
also possible that in the detector zone separately
an application of detector solution is made.</p>
    <p num="0025">The production of a total sequence of antigen/ epitope
sequences and interposed bridge compositions
being charged, for instance positively charged, has
further special preparative advantages. If such a
protein is produced gene-technologically by expression
in a cell, first a purification of the protein
from a cell extract is useful. The charges of the
bridge compositions permit now a particularly effective
and simple purification to very high purity
levels in an ion exchange chromatography, since the
isoelectrical point is extremely high. By such purification
of a protein produced by gene technology
according to the invention before the immobilization
method step, thus a particularly pure immobilizate
with regard to bound protein is obtained.
This increases the reliability of a test system to
a substantial degree.</p>
    <heading>Definitions</heading>
    <p num="0026">The term HIV test designates a detection method for
HIV antibodies in body components, in particular
body liquids. Body liquids are for instance blood,
serum, plasma, saliva, urine or liquor.</p>
    <p num="0027">The term protein comprises, in the framework of the
invention, compositions containing natural or non-natural
amino acid sequences. A protein may be synthesized
or at any case isolated with regard to the
amino acid sequences. Insofar the term protein also
comprises peptides. A protein needs not necessarily
be formed of amino acids only. In particular the
bridge composition may be structured differently
than of amino acids.</p>
    <p num="0028">As an antibody is designated a substance formed by
an immune reaction in an organism in a natural manner 
after an infection, such substance being capable
to specifically bind to the causative agent of
the infection or components thereof.</p>
    <p num="0029">As an antigen is designated a substance being capable
to specifically bind to an antibody. Antigens
and antibodies are assigned to each other on the
basis of the antibody or antibodies to be detected.</p>
    <p num="0030">An antigen/epitope sequence is an amino acid sequence,
formed of natural and/or non-natural amino
acids on one hand being chemically bindable to an
assigned antibody, and on the other hand having
such a secondary and/or tertiary structure that the
purely chemical binding is also possible in a
sterical manner, i.e. to the "key/lock principle".</p>
    <p num="0031">The term immobilization designates the binding of a
substance from the liquid phase to a solid phase
surface. The term binding comprises the chemisorption,
the ionic binding, the covalent binding and
intermediate types of such bindings.</p>
    <p num="0032">A bridge composition typically is an oligomer composition,
with the kind of monomers, the order or
sequence and the spatial orientation thereof including
any internal or external linkage being defined.
In particular are defined the positions of
the ends of the bridge composition with respect to
each other. It might happen that the antigen/epitope
sequence respectively connected or to be connected
and the opposing bridge composition are to
be considered, if the number of the degrees of
freedom of the bridge composition does not easily
permit a sufficiently clear definition of the spatial
position of the ends. A bridge composition is
not necessarily an artificial sequence or a sequence
artificially inserted between two antigen/epitope
sequences. It may also be a native sequence
between two naturally spaced antigen/epitope sequences, 
wherein one or more amino acids may also
be exchanged.</p>
    <p num="0033">A binding site is, in the terminology of the patent
claims, a reactive group of the bridge composition,
by means of which an immobilization at the solid
phase can be achieved.</p>
    <p num="0034">Exposure of an antigen/epitope sequence is the setting
of the secondary and/or tertiary structure of
the sequence such that a binding to the destination
antibody can be performed. In particular this means
the folding in the area of the antigen/epitope sequence.
Folding may also take place with the integration
of generating disulfide bridges. The folding
will usually lead to the generation of a specific
loop. An incorrect folding will lead to an
incorrect loop. An incorrect folding may take
place, if the ends of an antigen/epitope sequence
are stabilized relative to each other in a not
suitable manner.</p>
    <p num="0035">With the feature of the bridge composition it is
basically achieved that the parts of two bridge
compositions being arranged between two adjacent
binding sites will stabilize the ends of the interposed
antigen/epitope sequence such that the desired
folding is obtained. It is essential, herein,
that the two binding sites are geometrical fixed
points, due to the binding to the solid phase. Of
course, non-functional sequences may be interposed
between the end of a bridge composition and the antigen/epitope
sequence connected thereto, as long
as this will not affect the conditions described
above.</p>
    <p num="0036">A bridge sequence is a bridge composition being
formed of multiple natural and/or non-natural amino
acids. </p>
    <p num="0037">The term of the different antibodies means antibodies
of different type or of different structure.
Corresponding considerations apply to genes,
strains, sub-types and the like.</p>
    <p num="0038">The term specificity designates the capability of a
substance to detect out of a number of interaction
possibilities or reaction possibilities provided a
certain one or a group of certain ones. An antigen
being specific for a certain antibody or a certain
binding site of an antibody will have no reaction
with other antibodies not having this binding site
and being present in a sample, possibly after separation
of the substances disturbing this binding
site. In contrast thereto, antigens or sequences
binding a multitude of different antibodies in a
sample are not specific.</p>
    <p num="0039">The term detection designates the generation of an
arbitrary detector signal, observable directly by
means of the human senses or indirectly by means of
physical/chemical measuring methods, said detector
signal having its cause in an antibody/antigen
binding event. In the simplest case, it is a color
reaction. Detection methods for antibody/antigen
binding events are known in various ways to the man
skilled in the art and need not be explained here
in more detail.</p>
    <p num="0040">A detector solution comprises one or more substances
being capable to generate a detector signal
upon an antibody/antigen binding event.
The term solid phase designates a solid body with a
surface capable to bind binding sites.</p>
    <p num="0041">A rinsing step comprises rinsing of a generated immobilizate,
i.e. a solid phase with a protein bound
thereto, with a solution removing weakly bound proteins
and/or other substances from the surface of
the solid phase. </p>
    <p num="0042">A blocking step comprises rinsing of an immobilizate
with a solution comprising one or more substances,
saturating those zones of the surface of
the solid phase not gone in binding condition with
the protein, i.e. blocking them for the binding of
other substances directly at the surface of the
solid phase.</p>

    <p num="0069">The expression of a protein according to the invention
is performed as follows. After the coding nucleic
acid for the expressing protein having been
produced and built-in over restriction interfaces
into a commercially available vector, a transformation
of the plasmide into a commercially available
E. coli cell takes place. After inoculation of a
medium (e.g. LB medium) with the transformation addition,
the breeding of the cell culture by incubation
is performed at an optimum temperature (e.g.
37 °C). The protein expression is induced by addition
of isopropyl β-D thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
and achieved by continuation of the incubation. After
harvesting the E. coli cells by centrifugation,
a cell lysis with a lysis buffer (for instance a
guanidine hydrochloride containing buffer).</p>
    <p num="0070">Purification of the protein can be achieved by conventional
chromatography methods (for instance ion
exchange chromatography and gel chromatography),
the isoelectrical point of the proteins increased
by the insertion of positively charged sequences
being used in an advantageous manner to substantially
enrich the proteins by cation exchange chromatography.
Usually the chromatographic separations
are performed by means of chromatography columns
brought into the material. If the proteins have
been provided with a "tag" (e.g. a N or C-terminal
His6 peptide, a "flag tag" or a myc epitope), they
can be purified by utilization of an affinity chromatography,
the respective protein being bound by
the "tag" to the corresponding affinity chromatography
material (e.g. for the His6 tag to Ni-NTA material).
After the material having been washed several
times with corresponding washing buffers, the 
desired protein is separated from the material by
means of at least one elution buffer (for instance
by a buffer with substantially higher or lower pH
value). Finally, the eluates are subjected to several
dialysis steps, in order to permit further use
of the protein.</p>
    <heading>Example 6.</heading>
    <p num="0071">In this example, the production of an immobilizate
according to the invention is described. The purified
protein is diluted in a suitable manner with
an aqueous solution of 100 mM NaCl and 0.4 - 0.8 %
SDS. From this solution, 0.5 µl is applied by means
of a BioDot device (Cambridge, UK) on a nitrocellulose
membrane, so that on a spot of 3 - 4 mm diameter
there are 250 ng protein. After application of
the protein, the membrane is dried for at least one
hour, before the detection reaction is performed.</p>
    <p num="0072">An immobilizate is obtained, wherein the arrangement
and the folding of the protein is achieved in
a way that is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 3a.
The epitopes are separated by a positively charged
peptide sequence, permitting an adhesion to the
membrane and a correct folding of the epitopes (underlined
sequence sections).</p>
    <p num="0073">It may be noted, with regard to the folding shown
in Fig. 3a, that possibly not all protein molecules
applied on the solid phase can be folded in the
sketched way. Part of the molecules may, caused by
the lysis of the cells and the subsequent purification
procedure, be present in a disordered (denaturated)
folding condition. For the purpose of the
present invention it is however sufficient, if for
a protein structured according to the invention the
probability of a folding suitable for the binding
of antibodies, induced by the optimum adhesion on 
the solid phase permitted by the integration of the
bridge compositions, is clearly increased in comparison
to a protein containing no bridge compositions.
By this increased probability of the "correct"
folding , the possibility of the binding of
antibodies is in total substantially improved, and
thus the increase in sensitivity of the whole detection
method is secured.</p>
    <heading>Example 7.</heading>
    <p num="0074">To an immobilizate from example 6 have been fed serums
of various HIV positive patients, and the reaction
was examined by means of a detector solution.
In all cases a color reaction specific for
the binding antibody/antigen was observed. Incorrect
negative results were not obtained. Tests with
serums of HIV negative patients showed that not a
single incorrect positive result was obtained.</p>
    <heading>Example 8.</heading>
    <p num="0075">In this comparison example, an immobilizate has
been produced with a protein env 4 (ID E) according
to the procedure of example 6. The difference is
however, as can be seen from a comparison of figures
3a and 3c, that between the epitopes arranged
at the left side there is no positively charged
bridge composition. It can further be seen that
thereby the two epitopes on the left side are
closely arranged to each other and are folded - under
formation of disulfide bridges destroying the
antigenicity - such that binding of an antibody
cannot be achieved.</p>
    <p num="0076">With the same protein amount as in example 7, again
tests with serums of various HIV positive patients
have been made. Without exception, no reaction was 
shown, that is regularly incorrect negative results
were obtained.</p>
    <heading>Example 9.</heading>
    <p num="0077">In this example a protein (ID D) according to the
invention or an immobilizate with repetitive sequence
elements of different sub-types (identical
ones are also possible) is diagrammatically represented
with reference to Fig. 3b. This protein according
to the invention is formed of V3 loops only
of different HIV sub-types being separated by a
positively charged sequence element of gp120.</p>
    <heading>Example 10.</heading>
    <p num="0078">A rapid test according to the invention is configured
as follows. An immobilizate according to example
6 is positioned and fixed in a plastic housing
underneath an access opening such that at least
part of the immobilizate is open for access. The
immobilizate is placed on an absorbing material,
for instance cotton wool. A separately packed detector
solution belongs to the rapid test.</p>
    <p num="0079">The detection of antibodies bound to the antigen
may be performed by means of a detection solution
containing a conjugate of protein A with colloidal
gold. The application of such conjugates in immunological
test methods is generally known in the
art and has been described in the literature. This
conjugate may for instance be produced, as described
in US 5,541,059, by mixing 100 ml of a colloidal
gold solution (commercially available) with
100 ml of 0.006 mg/ml protein A solution (protein A
is commercially available in a lyophilized form and 
as a solution). Alternatively a protein A-gold conjugate
may commercially be acquired.</p>
    <p num="0080">The binding of the conjugate to the bound antibodies
can visually be detected. In this example, a
red stain will appear if bound antibodies are present.</p>
    <p num="0081">Alternatively to the conjugates with colloidal gold
a dye suspension can be used, with protein A being
adsorbed to a water-insoluble dye.</p>
    <p num="0082">A rapid test is performed as follows. A human
guinea pig is lightly injured by a prick. The resulting
drop of blood is received in a small capillary.
The capillary with the blood is then given
into a container together with a suitable solvent,
for instance physiological sodium chloride solution,
and is agitated until blood and solvent are
fully mixed. The contents of the container is then
fed through the access opening on the immobilizate.
Then, the detector solution is added, and it is
visually monitored whether a coloration of the immobilizate
visible through the access opening takes
place. Coloration means that HIV antibodies exist
in the blood of the human guinea pig. If there is
no coloration, the result is negative.</p>
