    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to an optical imaging
system used in an image transmission portion of, e.g., a
facsimile device or a copier. More particularly, the
present invention relates to an optical imaging system
including a plurality of rod lenses arranged in an
array.</p>
    <p num="0002">Optical imaging systems including a plurality of
rod lenses with a refractive index distribution in the
radial direction that are arranged in an array are
widely used in the image transmission portion of, e.g.,
facsimile devices or copiers.</p>
    <p num="0003">The refractive index distribution of such rod
lenses can be expressed, e.g., by
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center"><st32:italic>Eq.</st32:italic> 6   n(r)<st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup> = n<st32:sub pos="post">0</st32:sub><st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup>.{1 - (g.r)<st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup> + h<st32:sub pos="post">4</st32:sub>.(g.r)<st32:sup pos="post">4</st32:sup> + h<st32:sub pos="post">6</st32:sub>.(g.r)<st32:sup pos="post">6</st32:sup> + h<st32:sub pos="post">8</st32:sub>. (g.r)<st32:sup pos="post">8</st32:sup>}</st32:df>
where r is a radial distance from the optical axis of
the rod lens, n(r) is a refractive index at the radial
distance r, n<sub>0</sub> is a refractive index on the optical axis
of the rod lens (i.e., the center refractive index), and
g, h<sub>4</sub>, h<sub>6</sub> and h<sub>8</sub> are refractive index distribution
coefficients.</p>
    <p num="0004">Conventionally, the resolving power demanded from
such a rod lens array called for an MTF (modulation
transfer function) of at least 60% when a pattern of 4 -
6 line-pairs/mm (ca. 200 dpi - 300 dpi) was imaged. To
meet this demand, it was sufficient to control only g or
both g and h<sub>4</sub> of the refractive index distribution
coefficients for the rod lenses.</p>
    <p num="0005">Recently, however, with the steadily rising quality
of printers and scanners, there is a demand for rod lens
arrays with a resolving power of at least 12 line-pairs/mm
(ca. 600 dpi). To achieve a rod lens array
having such a high resolving power, all the refractive 
index distribution coefficients, including h<sub>6</sub> and h<sub>8</sub>,
have to be controlled precisely during design and
fabrication of the rod lens array.</p>
    <p num="0006">It is possible to determine the optimum refractive
index distribution coefficients for correcting the
spherical aberration on the optical axis of a single rod
lens. However, in the case of a plurality of rod lenses
arranged in an array, a change in the resolving power
may be caused not only by the spherical aberration,
field curvature and astigmatism of the individual lenses
but also by the overlapping of images from neighboring
lenses.</p>
    <p num="0007">The optimum refractive index distribution also
changes depending on the brightness of the rod lenses.
For example, when bright rod lenses having a large
angular aperture are employed, the refractive index
distribution coefficients for a small axial spherical
aberration are very different from the refractive index
distribution coefficients for a small field curvature.
The best resolving power can be achieved by striking a
balance between the two.</p>
    <p num="0008">An overlapping degree m is given by
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center"><st32:italic>Eq.</st32:italic> 7   m = X<st32:sub pos="post">0</st32:sub>/2r<st32:sub pos="post">0</st32:sub></st32:df>
where r<sub>0</sub> is the radius of an effective lens portion,
i.e., the radius of the portion of each rod lens that
functions as a lens, and X<sub>0</sub> is the image radius that a
single rod lens projects onto an image plane (i.e., the
field of view) . Here, X<sub>0</sub> is defined as X<sub>0</sub> = -r<sub>0</sub>/cos
(Z<sub>0</sub>π/P), where Z<sub>0</sub> is the length of a rod lens and P is a
one-pitch length of the rod lens. Even if the rod
lenses have the same refractive index distribution, the
overlapping degree m changes with the lens length, and
thus causing a change in the resolving power.</p>
    <p num="0009">Consequently, to achieve a high resolving power,
the refractive index distribution coefficients have to 
be determined separately in accordance with at least the
brightness and the overlapping degree of each rod lens.</p>
    <p num="0010">Therefore, with the foregoing in mind, it is an
object of the present invention to provide an optical
imaging system including a plurality of rod lenses
arranged in an array and having a refractive index
distribution that is ideal for achieving a high
resolving power.</p>
    <p num="0011">An optical imaging system according to a
configuration of the present invention includes a rod
lens array including a plurality of rod lenses having a

are located on the opposite sides of the rod lens array.

coefficients (n<sub>0</sub>, g, h<sub>4A</sub>, h<sub>6A</sub>, h<sub>8A</sub>) and (n<sub>0</sub>, g, h<sub>4B</sub>, h<sub>6B</sub>, h<sub>8B</sub>)

    <p num="0018">In the optical imaging system according to the
configuration of the present invention, it is preferable
that the radius r<sub>0</sub> of the portion of each rod lens
functioning as a lens is in the range of 0.05 mm ≤ r<sub>0</sub> ≤

production and assembly of the rod lenses and suppress
the aberrations of the rod lens array significantly.</p>
    <p num="0019">The refractive index distribution at the peripheral
portion of each rod lens can differ considerably from
the designed value. Therefore, in many cases, this

include a light absorption layer to prevent stray light
caused by total reflection at the lens side surface.
Moreover, depending on the conditions for fabricating
the rod lens array, the rod lenses may be arranged at a
certain distance between each other. Thus, in the
optical imaging system according to the configuration of
the present invention, it is preferable that r<sub>0</sub>/R is in
the range of 0.5 ≤ r<sub>0</sub>/R ≤ 1.0, where r<sub>0</sub> is the radius of
the portion of each rod lens functioning as a lens and
2R is a distance between the optical axes of two
neighboring rod lenses.</p>
    <p num="0020">In the optical imaging system according to the

X<sub>0</sub>/2r<sub>0</sub>, where r<sub>0</sub> is the radius of the portion of each rod
lens functioning as a lens and X<sub>0</sub> is an image radius that
the rod lens projects onto the image plane. When the
overlapping degree m is larger than 5.0, the image may
become too dark and the time for scanning etc. is long.
When the overlapping degree m is smaller than 0.9, the
periodic irregularity in brightness of the image plane
is increased.</p>
    <p num="0022">In the optical imaging system according to the
configuration of the present invention, it is preferable
that a parallel plane transparent substrate is arranged
so that the manuscript plane is located at the front
focal position of the rod lens array. This preferred
example allows the manuscript plane to be set at the
front focal position by only pressing a manuscript to
the surface of the transparent substrate. Moreover, it
is preferable that the parallel plane transparent
substrate is in contact with the lens surface of the rod
lens array. This can be achieved easily by adjusting
the thickness of the transparent substrate. This
preferred example can simplify adjustment of the
distance between the rod lens array and the front focal
position during fabrication of the optical imaging
system, thereby reducing the cost.</p>

    <p num="0046">Hereinafter, the present invention will be
described more specifically by way of an embodiment.</p>
    <p num="0047">As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, this embodiment employs
a rod lens array 2 for one-to-one imaging, where a
plurality of columnar rod lenses 1 having a refractive
index distribution in the radial direction are arranged
in two rows with their optical axes 1a in parallel. A
manuscript plane 3 and an image plane 4 are located on
the opposite sides of the rod lens array 2, thus
providing an optical imaging system.</p>
    <p num="0048">As shown in FIG. 3, the refractive index n of the
rod lenses 1 is distributed in the radial direction,
which is expressed by
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center"><st32:italic>Eq.</st32:italic> 13   n(r)<st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup> = n<st32:sub pos="post">0</st32:sub><st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup>.{1 - (g.r)<st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup> + h<st32:sub pos="post">4</st32:sub>.(g.r)<st32:sup pos="post">4</st32:sup> + h<st32:sub pos="post">6</st32:sub>.(g.r)<st32:sup pos="post">6</st32:sup> + h<st32:sub pos="post">8</st32:sub>.(g.r)<st32:sup pos="post">8</st32:sup>}</st32:df> 
where r is a radial distance from the optical axis 1a of
the rod lens 1, n(r) is the refractive index at the
radial distance r, n<sub>0</sub> is the refractive index on the
optical axis 1a of the rod lens 1 (i.e., the center
refractive index), and g, h<sub>4</sub>, h<sub>6</sub> and h<sub>8</sub> are refractive
index distribution coefficients.</p>
    <p num="0049">To achieve erected images as shown in FIG. 4, the
ratio Z<sub>0</sub>/P of a length Z<sub>0</sub> of the rod lenses 1 and a one-pitch
length P = 2π/g of the rod lenses 1 has to be in
the range of 0.5 ≤ Z<sub>0</sub>/P ≤ 1.0.</p>
    <p num="0050">The distance L<sub>0</sub> between the end surface (lens
surface) of the rod lens array 2 and the manuscript
plane 3 and that between the end surface (lens surface)
of the rod lens array 2 and the image plane 4 (see FIG.

    <p num="0051">It is desirable that the radius r<sub>0</sub> of the effective
lens portion, i.e., the radius of the portion of each
rod lens 1 that functions as a lens, is in the range of
0.05 mm ≤ r<sub>0</sub> ≤ 0.60 mm.</p>
    <p num="0052">Lenses having a small r<sub>0</sub> can provide high resolution
more easily because the amount of blurred image caused
by various aberrations of the rod lenses 1 increases in
proportion to the size of the entire lens. However,
when r<sub>0</sub> is smaller than 0.05 mm, it is difficult to
produce and assemble those rod lenses 1. When the
radius r<sub>0</sub> of the effective lens portion of each rod lens
1 is larger than 0.60 mm, the aberrations of the rod
lens array 2 become too large.</p>
    <p num="0053">The obtainable value of the refractive index n<sub>0</sub> on
the optical axis 1a of the rod lens 1 (i.e., the center
refractive index) depends on the rod lens material
(glass or synthetic resin) and is in the range of 1.4 ≤
n<sub>0</sub> ≤ 1.8.</p>
    <p num="0054">The brightness of the rod lenses 1 depends on the 
dimensionless factor g.r<sub>0</sub> or an angular aperture that
indicates the range over which the lenses can accept
light. The angular aperture  (°) is expressed by
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center"><st32:italic>Eq.</st32:italic> 15    = (n<st32:sub pos="post">0</st32:sub> . g.r<st32:sub pos="post">0</st32:sub>) / (π/180).</st32:df></p>
    <p num="0055">It is desirable that the dimensionless factor g.r<sub>0</sub>
is in the range of 0.04 ≤ g.r<sub>0</sub> ≤ 0.27. When g.r<sub>0</sub> is
smaller than 0.04, the image may become too dark and the
time for scanning etc. is long. When g.r<sub>0</sub> is larger than
0.27, the influence of field curvature and astigmatism
may become too large and the resolving power is reduced.</p>
    <p num="0056">The desirable range of g.r<sub>0</sub> corresponds to 4° ≤  ≤
24°, e.g., when the center refractive index n<sub>0</sub> is 1.60.</p>
    <p num="0057">In an optical imaging system including the above
rod lens array 2, a compound image is formed by a
plurality of rod lenses 1 on the image plane 4, as shown
in FIG. 5. Therefore, it is convenient to use a
dimensionless factor that represents the amount of
overlap, i.e., a so-called "overlapping degree". This
overlapping degree m is expressed by
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center"><st32:italic>Eq.</st32:italic> 16   m = X<st32:sub pos="post">0</st32:sub>/2r<st32:sub pos="post">0</st32:sub></st32:df>
where X<sub>0</sub> is the image radius (field of view) that the
single rod lens 1 projects onto the image plane 4 and is
defined by X<sub>0</sub> = -r<sub>0</sub>/cos(Z<sub>0</sub>π/P).</p>
    <p num="0058">It is desirable that the overlapping degree m of
the rod lens array 2 is in the range of 0.9 ≤ m ≤ 5.0.
When the overlapping degree m is larger than 5.0, the
image may become too dark and the time for scanning etc.
is long. When the overlapping degree m is smaller than
0.9, the periodic irregularity in brightness of the
image plane 4 is increased.</p>
    <p num="0059">It is most desirable to match the distance 2R
between the optical axes of neighboring rod lenses 1
with 2r<sub>0</sub> (i.e., a diameter of the effective lens portion 
of each rod lens 1). This is because the largest
quantity of light can be focused on the image. However,
the refractive index distribution at the peripheral
portion of the rod lens 1 can differ considerably from
the designed value. Therefore, in many cases, this
portion cannot be used as a lens. Also, the lenses may
include a light absorption layer to prevent stray light
caused by total reflection at the lens side surface.
Moreover, depending on the conditions for fabricating
the rod lens array 2, the rod lenses 1 may be arranged
with a certain distance between each other. Considering
the above circumstances, the ratio r<sub>0</sub>/R may be set so as
to be in the range of 0.5 ≤ r<sub>0</sub>/R ≤ 1.0.</p>
    <p num="0060">When developing the present invention, the
inventors took the standard for "high resolution" to
mean "a value of at least 50% for the MTF of a 24 line-pairs/mm
pattern on the center line of a rod lens array
2 including a plurality of rod lenses 1, which have an
effective lens portion radius r<sub>0</sub> of 0.15 mm and are
arranged in two rows with their optical axes 1a in
parallel", and determined the refractive index
distribution coefficients h<sub>4</sub>, h<sub>6</sub> and h<sub>8</sub> that satisfy this
standard.</p>
    <p num="0061">Specifically, a rod lens array 2 having the above
configuration was designed. Ray tracing was performed
by taking the perpendicular projection of a point A as
indicated in FIG. 6 onto the object plane for the light
source. The MTF values of a 24 line-pairs/mm pattern
were calculated for the X direction and for the Y
direction, and the smaller value was taken as the MTF
value for the rod lens array 2. The optical design
software "Olso Six" by Sinclair Optics (US) was used for
the ray tracing. Table 1 shows the specifications of
twenty-four types of rod lens arrays 2 used for the
calculation. The angular aperture  ranges from 7 to
20°, the center refractive index n<sub>0</sub> of the rod lenses 1
ranges from 1.5 to 1.8, the overlapping degree m ranges 
from 1.0 to 2.5, and the radius r<sub>0</sub> of the portion of each
rod lens 1 that functions as a lens is set to 0.3 mm.
For each of the rod lens arrays 2, a range of the
refractive index distribution coefficients h<sub>4</sub>, h<sub>6</sub> and h<sub>8</sub>
over which the MTF value of a 24 line-pairs/mm pattern
is at least 50% was determined. Hereinafter, this range
is referred to as "good image range" of the refractive
index distribution coefficients h<sub>4</sub>, h<sub>6</sub> and h<sub>8</sub>.
