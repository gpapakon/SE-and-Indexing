        <u style="single">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0001">Orally administered controlled release systems are
pharmaceutical formulations designed to increase the
bioavailability of the active ingredients in systemic
products and to eliminate the peaks and fluctuations in
their plasmatic levels. In general, it can be said that
the idea is to increase the regularity and predictability
of the active ingredients' performance. Moreover, oral
administration is evidently ideal for products targeted
at the organs in the gastrointestinal tract (hereinafter,
GIT). If, for example, the target organ is the stomach,
the aim is a longer retention time and a homogeneous
distribution of the active ingredient.</p>
    <p num="0002">On the other hand, oral administration is extremely
difficult. Although it is the simplest from a practical
viewpoint, and therefore the most common, it is possibly
the most complex, since it implies the interaction of the
drug in the pharmaceutical formula with different mucosal
or immunological systems, different pHs, the presence or
absence of bacterial flora, etc. All this means that a
specific design is required, depending on the point where
the action or absorption is desired. The length of the
system itself, which in humans is around 10 m, has also
to be considered.</p>
    <p num="0003">Moreover, the normal physiology of the GIT can often
be, and in fact is, altered by the active ingredient
vehicle (modified transit, for example).</p>
    <p num="0004">One of the delayed action mechanisms that have been
described is the floating system, as described, for
example, for levodopa, using HBS® capsules.</p>
    <p num="0005">In general, the idea is for the vehicle to be
capable of floating in the gastric cavity, gradually 
releasing the active ingredient for systemic formulas, or
facilitating its retention and homogeneous distribution
if the stomach is the target organ. Therefore, the
floatability of the different excipients can be initially
related to an absorption modulation. The subject of the
floatability of different excipients has been the subject
of different bibliographical reviews, from which the
following references can be selected:

    <p num="0006">Different polymers have been used in different
floating formulations, including chitosans, alginates,
agar, polylactic, polyacrylates, etc., all of which are 
polymers with different hydrophilicity, pH sensitivity,
swelling speed, etc.</p>
    <p num="0007">"Floating" vehicles are also especially suitable for
aiming the active ingredient at the gastric cavity. When
the target is another GIT organ, the systems have to be
more complex regarding their specific organ recognition
capacity.</p>

        <u style="single">OBJECT OF THIS INVENTION</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0008">The object of this invention is the design of
different orally administered pharmaceutical systems that
simultaneously combine the properties of gel
convertibility, floatability, controlled release,
dispersability, adhesion, non-modification of the
gastrointestinal transit, hydrophilicity, administrable
free or in capsule form, and stability, and finally are
capable of interacting well, retaining different types of
drugs (anionic, cationic, neutral, etc.), to modulate the
release of active ingredients after their systemic
absorption or homogeneously disperse substances targeted
at the gastric cavity itself. In this case, the idea is
not to retain the active ingredient by interaction with a
hydrophilic matrix floating in the gastric cavity, but a
greater retention and homogeneous distribution of the
active ingredient in the cavity itself.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THIS INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0009">To simultaneously comply with all the above
requirements, binary systems have been designed,
consisting of two hydrophilic polymers with gelling
properties, giving rise to two gels, in which one of them
is capable of interacting with the active ingredient
(catcher gel or gel A), modulating at least partially its
release, and the other has the function of dispersing the
first gel homogeneously, and the floatibility and
adhesion of the complex system in the gastric cavity, and
it may also intervene in the modulation of the active 
ingredient release (dilution gel or gel B). These systems
can be prepared so that their final form is humid, with
the gels swollen, or dry. The latter is one of the ways
of regulating the active ingredient's release, in so much
as the dry gels absorb water and swell and the
distribution is established between the active ingredient
retained in the gel and the external aqueous medium.</p>
    <p num="0010">The product or composition that is the object of
this invention consists of the intimate mixture of two
hydrophilic gels that in turn consist of polysaccharides.
The mixture may or may not have been dried, and it has
the following properties:
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>One of the hydrophilic polysaccharides is agar
(complex polysaccharide extracted from rhodophytan
algae and formed by linked α (1-3) and β (1-4)
galactose polysaccharide chains, which can be
sulphated, acetylated, etc., as described, for
example, in the Merck Index, 12<sup>th</sup> ed., page 34).</li><li>The other hydrophilic polysaccharide can be either of
the following two:</li></ul><ul list-style="bullet"><li>Alginate (polysaccharide consisting of residues of
β-D-manosiluronate and α-L-gulusiluronate linked in
1-4, as described, for example, in the Merck Index,
12<sup>th</sup> ed., page 45).</li><li>Chitosan (polysaccharide derived from chitin and
consisting of residues of β-D-glucosamine linked 1-4,
as described, for example, in the Merck Index,
12<sup>th</sup> ed., page 342).</li><li>In its dry form it can be suspended in water or in
aqueous solutions and it is capable of slowly
absorbing water, giving rise to a mixture than can be
dispersed simply by stirring, which has the
characteristics described for the liquid suspension
form.</li><li>In its liquid suspension form it is capable of 
floating on liquids such as incomplete gastric juice
(consisting of NaCl 2 g/L and concentrated HCl
(density 1.19) 7 mL/L in de-ionised water), adhering
to surfaces such as glass, catching substances (active
ingredients) and release them progressively, or act as
a dispersing agent for substances (active
ingredients).</li><li>The active ingredients concerned, which are
incorporated into the process of obtaining the product
or composition that is the object of this invention,
are substances that are soluble or can be suspended in
water or aqueous solutions, such as riboflavin 5
phosphate, paracetamol, dimemorfan, ibuprofen,
gentamycin, cimetidine, etc.</li><li>The dispersible active ingredients, which are also
incorporated into the process of obtaining the product
or composition that is the object of this invention,
are substances that are insoluble or difficult to
suspend in water, such as magaldrate and other
neutralising anti-acids such as complex aluminium and
magnesium salts, etc.
This product or composition is obtained in
accordance with the general procedure described below:
<sl><li>The procedure consists of preparing two gels
separately, which are intimately mixed by trituration
when prepared.
<ul list-style="bullet"><li>The first gel, gel A or retention gel, has one
hydrophilic polymer, agar, at a high concentration
(between 0.4 and 1.8% w/w in the mixture forming gel
A) and a second polymer (alginate or chitosan) (at a
concentration of 0.02 and 1.0% w/w in the mixture
forming gel A), and an important feature of the system
is that although the second polymer is capable of
gelling, the relevant gelling agent is found in the
second gel, gel B or dilution gel. This gel A has a 
greater retention capacity, due to the sieve effect
and ionic interaction.</li></ul></li><li>- The second gel, gel B or dilution gel, consists of
agar at a low concentration (between 0.04 and 0.1% w/w
in the mixture forming gel B) and the gelling reagent
or reagents of the second polymer of gel A, which can
be, for example, calcium chloride for alginate (at a
concentration of ½ and 1/8 in relation to the
alginate) and sodium tripolyphosphate for chitosan (at
a concentration of between ¼ and 1/8 of the chitosan),
with the properties of dispersing the first gel and
gelling its second component when both gels are mixed.</li></sl></li></ul></p>
    <p num="0011">Both gels are formed separately, in both cases first
dissolving the agar in a very hot aqueous solution (at a
temperature of over 80°C) and then lowering the
temperature (not below 40 - 45°C), and adding the rest of
the components; finally, they are left to gel by
incubation at a low temperature (below 30°C). Once both
gels have been formed separately, they are roughly
triturated, mixed, and then exhaustively triturated,
facilitating the interaction between the gelling
ingredient in gel B and the second polymer in gel A. Once
this internal mixture of the two gels is complete, it is
left to rest for a time at a low temperature for the
mixed gel (A + B) to form. After this time, which will
depend on the polymer concentrations and the possible
effects of the molecules on the gelling, it is
exhaustively triturated and, optionally, depending on the
final pharmaceutical presentation, it is dried by freeze-drying
or another suitable method.</p>
    <p num="0012">The active ingredient can be included in gel A or B,
depending on factors such as the ion load, solubility,
interference with the gelling process, etc., and
objective (catching or dispersion). The concentration
will also depend on these factors, and can be between 0 
and 20% w/w in the mixture forming the respective gel.</p>

      <u style="single">EXAMPLE 1</u>
    </heading>
    <heading>PREPARATION OF THE SYSTEM THAT IS THE OBJECT OF THIS
INVENTION, EMPTY (WITH NO MOLECULES)</heading>
    <p num="0013">Following is a description of how to prepare the
controlled release system without vehicle molecules. As
described, it is manufactured in two phases, with a
different polymer concentration in each phase, fraction A
and fraction B. Once both bases have been prepared, they
are triturated and mixed in equal quantities.

Manufacture of fraction A (formula for 150 g w/w):
<sl><li>1<sup>st</sup>.- Each of the products is weighed: Agar-agar 1.4 g,
sodium alginate 0.6 g, purified water 148 g.</li><li>2<sup>nd</sup>.- 140 g of purified water is heated to boiling point
in a 300 mL glass beaker, in heated magnetic stirring
equipment.</li><li>3<sup>rd</sup>.- When it reaches boiling point, the Agar-agar is
added gradually.</li><li>4<sup>th</sup>.- When dissolved, stirring and heating continues for
five minutes.</li><li>5<sup>th</sup>.- The heating is switched off and stirring continues
until the temperature falls to 70°C.</li><li>6<sup>th</sup>.- When the temperature reaches 701C, the sodium
alginate is added gradually, continuing to stir until it
is completely dissolved.

(When an active ingredient is to be added to this
fraction (see following examples), it is added when,
after the alginate is completely dissolved, the
temperature has fallen at least to 60°C (or the highest
temperature that the active ingredient can support,
providing it is no lower than 40 - 45°C).</li><li>7<sup>th</sup>.- When the components are dissolved, it is completed
to 150 g with purified water.</li><li>8<sup>th</sup>.- It is left to gel in a refrigerator (at 
approximately 4 - 10°C).

Manufacture of fraction B (formula for 150 g w/w):</li><li>1<sup>st</sup>.- Each of the products is weighed: agar-agar 0.15 g,
calcium chloride 0.1 g, purified water 149.75 g.</li><li>2<sup>nd</sup>.- The purified water is heated to boiling point in a
300 mL glass beaker, in heated magnetic stirring
equipment.</li><li>3<sup>rd</sup>.- When it reaches boiling point, the Agar-agar is
added gradually.</li><li>4<sup>th</sup>.- When dissolved, the stirring and heating continues
for five minutes.</li><li>5<sup>th</sup>.- The heating is switched off and stirring continues
until the temperature falls to 50°C.</li><li>6<sup>th</sup>.- When the temperature has reached 50°C, the calcium
chloride that was previously dissolved in water is added
(adding 3 mL of a 3% solution in purified water),
continuing to stir.

(When the active ingredient is to be added to this
fraction (see following examples), it is added when,
after adding the calcium chloride, the temperature has
fallen to at least 50°C (or the maximum temperature
supported by the active ingredient, providing it is no
lower than 40 - 45°C).</li><li>7<sup>th</sup>.- It is completed to 150 g with purified water.</li><li>8<sup>th</sup>.- It is left to gel in a refrigerator (at
approximately 4 - 10°C).

Manufacture of the mixture of fractions A and B.</li><li>1<sup>st</sup>.- Once both fractions have gelled, fraction A,
previously roughly broken up with a spatula, and fraction
B are put into a 500 ml glass beaker.</li><li>2<sup>nd</sup>.- On scales, the weight is adjusted to 300 g with
purified water.</li><li>3<sup>rd</sup>.- The gels are triturated with a Silverson mixer. The
mixer head is inserted approximately 1 cm above the
liquid. It is then mixed at a medium speed until the 
pieces disappear. The product is left to rest for around
10 minutes, and then it is mixed again for 10 minutes
with the mixer head on the bottom of the beaker at the
same speed.</li><li>4<sup>th</sup>.- It is left to rest in the covered beaker, in a
refrigerator (at approximately 4 - 10°C) for 12 - 24
hours.</li><li>5<sup>th</sup>.- It is triturated at ambient temperature in a
Silverson mixer for 10 minutes, with the mixer head on
the bottom of the beaker, and at low speed.

Preparation of the freeze-dried product:

This process takes place 48 hours after completing the
manufacture of the product in the refrigerator.</li><li>1<sup>st</sup>.- The product is introduced into freeze-drying
chambers, so that it occupies no more than 1/5 of the
volume of the chamber.</li><li>2<sup>nd</sup>.- The chambers are frozen to -80°C, and the content
is left to freeze (approximately 20 - 30 minutes).</li><li>3<sup>rd</sup>. - It is freeze-dried in a Teistar Cryodos or similar
freeze-dryer (condenser temperature -35°C to -40°C,
approx. vacuum 1 µ).</li><li>4<sup>th</sup>.- When freeze-dried, it is removed from the freeze-dryer
and stored at a low temperature (4°C).</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0014">The freeze-drying process can be replaced by another
drying process, depending on the stability of the
substance concerned.</p>
    <heading>"IN VIVO" BEHAVIOUR OF THE SYSTEM</heading>
    <p num="0015">Following is a description of the floating behaviour
of the system that is the object of this invention (FDS
system) in pigs, with gammagraphy techniques based on the
product marked as <sup>99m</sup>Tc (according to procedures
described, for example, in SS Davis, JG hardy, SP Newman,
IR Wilding "Gamma scintigraphy in the evaluation of
pharmaceutical dosage forms". Eur J Nuc Med 19, 971 - 986
(1992). </p>
    <p num="0016">FDS System marking
<sl><li>1.- FDS System marking with the radionuclide <sup>99m</sup>Tc
(according to the technique described in J. Steigman, G
Meinken, P Richards "The reduction of pertechnetate-99 by
stannous chloride. The stoichiometry of the reaction in
HCl, in citrate buffer and Ind DTPA buffer". Int J App
Radiat Isotopes 26, 601 - 609 (1975)):
<sl><li>The FDS System was marked directly through ionic bonds
based on a master solution containing the component to be
marked (8 mg/mL in water) and an acid tin solution as a
technetium-reducing agent. The proportions of the
components of the tin solution, and the incubation times,
were modified until a good marking efficiency (78 - 86%)
was obtained with the best possible stability conditions.</li></sl></li><li>2.- Determination of the radiochemical purity and
stability of the FDS System by ascending chromatography
and centrifugation, measuring the radioactivity in the
supernatant (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) and in the precipitate (FDS System -
<sup>99m</sup>Tc). It was then dialysed for 6 hours in order to
remove the radiochemical impurities (free technetium)
prior to the "in vivo" tests.</li></sl></p>
    <heading>"In vivo" tests</heading>
    <p num="0017">The objective was to evaluate the FDS System marked
with <sup>99m</sup>Tc by means of isotopic studies of gastric
emptying in an experimental animal model using pigs of
the Landrace Large white species suitable for
extrapolating the experimental results to humans. Three
experiments (2 isotopic dynamic gastric emptying studies)
were performed with each animal:
<sl><li>1.- Negative Control: To determine the gastric emptying
standard and the normal reference values for each of the
experimental animals.</li><li>2.- Marked FDS System in a total of 8 animals.</li><li>3.- Negative control with non-marked FDS System in order
to verify that the FDS System does not alter gastric 
emptying "per se".</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0018">To evaluate gastric emptying, the animals were
positioned on their backs in a dual-head gamma chamber,
acquiring dynamic dorsal and ventral images throughout
the study (7 hours).</p>
    <p num="0019">Upon completion of the study, we obtained the
gastric emptying curves (activity/time curves corrected
by the radioactive decay of the radionuclide <sup>99m</sup>Tc) to
determine:
<sl><li>A) Standard gastric emptying for liquids in the
experimental animals.</li><li>B) Standard gastric emptying for the product,
analysing: The product's gastric behaviour, if
there are changes regarding gastric emptying
compared with the control and the time that the
product remains in the stomach.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0020">To evaluate the results, we calculated the following
variables from the disintegration per second corrected by
the "radioactive decay" in pre-established times (every
15 minutes, from the start to the end of the study): The
% of gastric retention activity throughout the study,
Area: average activity per 15 minutes, Accumulated area:
<sl><li>accumulated average activity per 15 minutes, Possible
area: the area of the curve (variable determined from the
area and accumulated area variables).</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0021">The results obtained were as follows.
<sl><li>1. The half time (time in which half of the activity was
eliminated) was 18 minutes for the control group,
whereas in the marked FDS System group, half of the
activity had still not been eliminated after 4 hours.</li><li>2. The percentage of average activity that remains in the
stomach was 24% and 30% for the control group and the
FDS System-control group, respectively, after one
hour, and 11 and 12% respectively after four hours,
whereas in the studies conducted with the marked FDS 
System, it was 73% after one hour, 62% after four
hours and 47% after 7 hours.</li><li>3. The total area under the curve expressed as a
proportion of the possible area was 0.24 and 0.28 for
the control group and the FDS System-control group,
respectively, compared with 0.7 for the FDS System
group.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0022">From these results, we can conclude that:
<sl><li>1. There are statistically significant differences
(p&lt;0.001) between the control group and the FDS System
group, both in the percentage of activity and in the
possible area at all the time intervals.</li><li>2. The control group and the FDS System-control group
have a similar gastric emptying pattern, and there are
no statistically significant differences between them.</li><li>3. The marked FDS System remains in the stomach 7 hours
after administration, unlike the control group.</li><li>4. The FDS System "per se" does not alter the gastric
dynamics.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0023">The FDS System described in the previous example can
be used to contain or disperse different active
ingredients, as shown in the following examples:</p>

    <heading>PREPARATION OF THE SYSTEM THAT IS THE OBJECT OF THIS
INVENTION, TO CONTAIN PARACETAMOL (FDS System-Paracetamol).</heading>
    <p num="0024">The FDS System-paracetamol is prepared following the
procedure described in example 1, adding the paracetamol:
<sl><li>a) in equal quantities to fractions A and B to give a
final content of 1% w/w in the finished mixture.</li><li>b) Adding the paracetamol to fraction A to give a final
content of 0.25% w/w in the finished mixture.</li><li>c) Adding the paracetamol to fraction A to give a final
content of 0.50% w/w in the finished mixture.</li></sl></p>
    <heading>RELEASE STUDIES ON THE PARACETAMOL IN FDS SYSTEM-PARACETAMOL</heading>
    <p num="0025">The release studies were performed by dialysis at
37°C against artificial gastric juice without pepsin (7
ml HCl with d 1.19 and 2 g NaCl in 1 l of MilliQ water
and with the System FDS-Paracetamol product previously
reconstituted with MilliQ water at concentrations of
between 5 and 20 mg/ml, using as a reference free
paracetamol at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in MilliQ
water.</p>
    <p num="0026">The paracetamol evaluations were conducted with a
standard curve for paracetamol at 100 mg/ml in MilliQ
water determined by spectroscopic absorbency evaluation
at 243 nm.</p>
    <p num="0027">A delayed release effect is produced especially in
the preparations in which the concentration of
paracetamol in the mixture prepared was between 0.25 and
0.5% (w/w) and with a release speed of 75% compared with
the control, so the total release of the dose occurred in
2.0 - 2.5 hours (less than the time that the vehicle
remained in the stomach).</p>

ortho-phtaldehyde and HPLC separation with C18 column,
detecting at 330 nm.

In the test conditions, the gentamycin is not released
from the FDS System-Gentamycin with phosphate buffer and
over 3 volumes of gastric juice are required to elute it,

    <heading>PREPARATION OF THE SYSTEM THAT IS THE OBJECT OF THIS
INVENTION, DISPERSING MAGALDRATE (FDS System-Magaldrate).</heading>
    <p num="0036">As described in the General Description of the
invention, the FDS System not only obtains a delayed
effect from the preferred binding to a mixed hydrophilic
gel with floating/retaining capacity but it also
optimises pharmaceutical formulations in which the
therapeutic target is a component of the GIT, concretely
the stomach. For neutralising anti-acids, the fundamental
difference with the other active ingredients tested is
that the quantity of the active ingredient to be
contained is much greater, and therefore the mission of
the mixed FDS hydrophilic gel is, more than to retain, to
disperse the neutralising agent to obtain its homogeneous
distribution in the gastric cavity, thus optimising the
use of the neutralisation equivalents of the neutralising
agent.</p>
    <p num="0037">The FDS System-Magaldrate is prepared as follows:
<sl><li>A) 355 g and 200 g are obtained of fractions A and B,
respectively, as described in example 1, adding
magaldrate to fraction A up to a final concentration
of 10% (w/w of the mixture obtained) and to fraction B 
up to a final concentration of 18% (w/w of the mixture
obtained), leaving them to gel as indicated in example
1.</li><li>B) 125 g of a fraction consisting of an aqueous
magaldrate suspension at 19% w/w is prepared.</li><li>C) Fractions A, B and C are mixed and processes as
indicated in example 1 for the mixture of fractions A
and B. The mixture of the three is the final product,
which is not freeze-dried (in the final preparation
and before processing, a CO<sub>2</sub> generator such as Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
may or may not be added).</li></sl></p>
    <heading>EVALUATION OF THE NEUTRALISING SPEED OF FDS SYSTEM-MAGALDRATE
COMPARED WITH THE NEUTRALISING SPEED OF
MAGALDRATE</heading>
    <p num="0038">The FDS System-Magaldrate is capable of neutralising
the same quantity of hydrochloric acid "in vitro", for
equal quantities of active ingredient, at a speed between
10 and 20 times greater than Magaldrate, which shows the
efficacy of the active ingredient dispersion.</p>
    <heading>PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF THE NEUTRALISING CAPACITY
OF FDS SYSTEM-MAGALDRATE COMPARED WITH CONTROL MAGALDRATE</heading>
    <p num="0039">The neutralising capacity of the FDS System-Magaldrate
formulation was evaluated "in vivo" in a model
with pigs (Landrace large white) between 16 and 18 kilos
in weight. Intragastric acidity was evaluated with a
digital pH-meter connected to a calibrated pH catheter
with two sensors 5 cm apart, which detects the pH in two
different sectors of the stomach. For the evaluation of
the pH, a fistula was performed between the stomach and
the abdominal cavity. Baseline and further studies were
conducted over three days on each animal and on the test
date, the animals received the anti-acid product by
probe. The products were: placebo, reference magaldrate
and FDS System-magaldrate. The animals fasted from the
day before the test. The intragastric pH was recorded 
continuously for 12 hours (1 reading every 4 seconds).</p>
    <p num="0040">The results obtained are expressed as <u style="single">"neutralising
time</u>", which is defined as the time taken to return to
the initial pH. The mean values were 47 minutes for the
reference magaldrate and 110 minutes for the FDS System-magaldrate.
This result confirms, in an animal model that
can be extrapolated to humans, the pharmacological
optimisation obtained by the use of the FDS System.</p>
