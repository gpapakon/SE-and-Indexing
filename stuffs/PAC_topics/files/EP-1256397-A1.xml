    <p>A sheet hydroforming method is disclosed wherein two stacked
metallic sheets are clamped between a pair of upper and lower dies 10, 11
and a fluid is introduced and pressurized between mating surfaces of the
metallic sheets, causing the metallic sheets to bulge into a space defined by
die cavities 10b and 11b. A thru-hole lid for introducing the fluid is formed
in one of the dies so as to lead to a holding surface of the die, while a pierced
hole for introducing the fluid is formed in one of the metallic sheets in a
portion of the one metallic sheet which portion is in contact with a holding
surface 10a (10b) of one of the dies, the pierced hole being positioned with
the thru-hole 11d, then the fluid is introduced in a pressurized state
between mating surfaces of the metallic sheets from the thru-hole through
the pierced hole, thereby causing the metallic sheets to bulge. According to
this method, a pressurized fluid can be introduced between the mating
surfaces of blanks easily without leakage of the fluid. Not only the
efficiency of the sheet hydroforming method but also the dent resistance of a
formed part can be improved.

    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a metallic sheet hydroforming
method using metallic sheets as blanks, as well as a forming die used in the
method and a formed part on workpiece.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
    <p num="0002">A sheet hydroforming method is known in which peripheral portions
of two metallic sheets (hereinafter referred to also as "blanks") are bonded
together, then a fluid is introduced between the blanks, followed by the
application of pressure of the fluid, causing the blanks to be bulged.</p>
    <p num="0003">FIGS. 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D illustrate a forming method described in
Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 47-033864. FIG. 1A is a
perspective view of two blanks which are each in a ring shape, FIG. 1B is a
sectional view of a die portion before a forming work in which two blanks
bonded together at their peripheral portions are set between upper and
lower dies, FIG. 1C is a sectional view of the die portion in a completed state
of sheet hydroforming, and FIG. 1D is a perspective view of a bent tubular
part obtained by cutting a formed part on workpiece crosswise.</p>
    <p num="0004">The blanks shown in FIG. 1A are in a state before being subjected to
peripheral bonding into a single blank. The blanks are two ring-like blanks
100 and 102. A pipe-like nozzle 101 is bonded, for example by welding, to
the position of a thru-hole formed in a planar portion of the blank 100. The
blanks 100 and 102 are put one on the other and are bonded together for
example by welding throughout the whole inner and outer peripheries 
thereof to afford a workpiece ("bonded blank" hereinafter).</p>
    <p num="0005">First, as shown in FIG. 1B, the bonded blank, indicated at 103, is set
on a lower die 104, then an upper die 105 is brought down from above by
means of a drive unit (not shown), an outer peripheral portion 103a and an
inner peripheral portion 103b of the bonded blank are pressed and
sandwiched in between the upper and lower dies, and the nozzle and a pipe
106 are connected together through a thru-hole 105b formed in the upper
die. Die cavities 104a and 105a having an inner contour shape which is the
same as an outer contour shape of product are formed in the lower die 104
and upper die 105, respectively. Then, a fluid is introduced between
mating surfaces of the bonded blank from a pump (not shown) through the
pipe and nozzle, followed by the application of pressure, causing the bonded
blank to bulge.</p>
    <p num="0006">The full-circled bonding of the blanks 100 and 102 is for the purpose
of preventing the leakage of fluid from the mating surfaces of the bonded
blank.</p>
    <p num="0007">As shown in FIG. 1C, by raising the pressure of the fluid 107, the
metallic sheets bulge into contact with inner walls of the die cavities 104a
and 105a and the forming work is completed. Thereafter, the internal fluid
pressure is decreased, the pipe is pulled out, the upper die is raised, a ring-like
hollow shell 108 is taken out, and the interior fluid is discharged from
the nozzle. The formed part on workpiece is cut crosswise into a desired
product size, affording a bent tubular part 109.</p>
    <p num="0008">The above method brings about the following advantages in
comparison with a method wherein upper and lower parts are manufactured
separately by a press stamping method for example and thereafter both are
bonded and assembled together by, say, welding. </p>
    <p num="0009">The first advantage is that the bonding is easy because the blanks
are bonded in a flat state. In case of bonding upper and lower stamped
parts, it is necessary to use a jig for shape correction and alignment with
respect to each of elastically recovered stamped parts, and the number of
working steps increases.</p>
    <p num="0010">The second advantage is that since the working is done using upper
and lower dies and fluid, the tool expenses are low in comparison with the
press stamping method.</p>
    <p num="0011">The third advantage is that since a stretch formed portion is created
by forming with a tensile stress based on a fluid pressure, a problem such as
body wrinkling, which is often observed in press stamping, is difficult to
occur.</p>
    <p num="0012">These advantages are also true of the following prior art examples.</p>
    <p num="0013">FIGS. 2A and 2B are diagrams for explaining a forming method
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 63-295029. FIG.
2A is a perspective view of a bonded blank before forming and FIG. 2B is a
perspective view of a formed part on workpiece.</p>
    <p num="0014">In this method, as shown in FIG. 2A, two blanks 110 and 111, which
are fabricated in a developed shape of a desired product by a press punching
method for example, are put one on the other and outer peripheral edges
112 of their mating surfaces are bonded together by a laser welding method
for example to afford a bonded blank 113. The bonded blank 113 is then set
within upper and lower dies and pressurized fluid is introduced between the
mating surfaces from a suitable bonded blank opening, causing the blank to
bulge. As shown in FIG. 2B, the resulting formed part is an engine
manifold part 117 having a welded line 116, in which manifold portions 114
and a trunk portion 115 are cut at their end portions. </p>
    <p num="0015">FIGS. 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, and 3E are diagrams explanatory of a forming
method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 09-029329.
FIG. 3A shows blanks 120 and 121 before bonding, the blanks 120 and 121
being formed with half conical recesses 120a and 121a on flange,
respectively, by press stamping. FIG. 3B shows a bonded blank 123
obtained by superimposing blanks 120 and 121 one on the other and
bonding the two by, say, laser welding along a continuous welded line 123b
except a conical inlet 123a. FIG. 3C shows a state in which a peripheral
portion of the bonded blank 123 is held grippingly by lower die 125 and
upper die 126 attached to a press machine (not shown), then a conical head
127b of an injection nozzle 127 is inserted into the inlet 123 by means of a
drive unit (not shown) and is pushed against half conical recesses 125b and
126b on die surfaces. Then, pressurized fluid is injected between the blank
mating surfaces from a pump (not shown) through an intra-nozzle channel
127a, causing die cavities 125a and 126a having the same inner contour
shape as an outer contour shape of product to bulge. With this bulging
motion, a flange 123c which has been held grippingly by the dies 125 and
126 moves gradually toward the die cavities 125a and 126a except the
portion near the inlet. FIG. 3D shows a completely bulged state in which
the blanks were brought into contact with inner walls of the die cavities
125a and 126a by increasing the pressure of fluid 128. Thereafter, the
pressure of the fluid is decreased and the fluid is discharged from the inlet
123a to afford a formed part 129. FIG. 3E shows an example of a tubular
part 129 obtained by cutting off the portion located outside the welded line
123b and also cutting off both ends of the stretch formed portion of
workpiece.</p>
    <p num="0016">In the above sheet hydroforming methods, the following problems 
are encountered in injecting the pressurized fluid between the mating
surfaces of blanks.</p>
    <p num="0017">In the forming method shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D it is
necessary that the nozzle be bonded to the associated blank while assuming
a position which permits smooth insertion of the nozzle into the thru-hole
formed in the upper die as the bulging motion proceeds. This requirement
may not be satisfied in some particular sectional shape of product. Besides,
since connection and disconnection between the nozzle and the pipe are
troublesome, the productivity is low and automation is difficult.</p>
    <p num="0018">In the forming method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application
Laid Open No. 63-295029, which is illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2B, there is
made no reference to a pressurized fluid injecting method.</p>
    <p num="0019">In the forming method illustrated in FIGS. 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, and 3E
there arises a problem of how to seal the pressurized fluid between the
bonded blank inlet and the conical portion of the nozzle.</p>
    <p num="0020">FIG. 4 is a front view showing the inlet 123a as seen in the direction
of arrow A in FIG. 3B. Since bent portions 130 are rounded at a radius at
least equal to the blank thickness, there are formed tapered grooves 131 and
hence it is necessary to prevent the leakage of pressurized fluid from the
grooves 131. But in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 09-029329
there is found no explanation about a method to be taken for the prevention
of such fluid leakage.</p>
    <p num="0021">As noted above, as to the sheet hydroforming in which a pressurized
fluid in injected between the mating surfaces of the bonded blank, working
methods are disclosed in the prior art references, but a concrete pressurized
fluid injecting method superior in utility is not disclosed therein.</p>
    <p num="0022">A description will now be given about dent resistance. As to 
shallow-bottom panel parts (also referred to simply as "panel parts"
hereinafter) formed by metallic sheets, typical of which are automobile door
panel, bonnet, and trunk lid, it is required for them to possess a property
such that a dent is difficult to remain after the application of a local
external force to the panel surface, i.e., dent resistance. For example, in
the case of the automobile door panel, if a dent defect ("dent" hereinafter)
occurs due to pressing with a thumb near a door handle at the time of
opening or closing of the door concerned, the appearance of the door is
impaired.</p>
    <p num="0023">Also in the case of the automobile bonnet and trunk lid, their
appearance is impaired by the dent caused by pressing with palms when
they are closed. Not only the pressing with fingers and palms, but also the
collision of a flying stone with a panel part during vehicular running may
form a dent. Dent resistance is a subject to be attained not only in such
vehicular panel parts as mentioned above but also in panel parts of home
electric appliances such as the refrigerator door.</p>
    <p num="0024">FIGS. 5A, 5B, and 5C show an example of a method for evaluating
quantitatively how dent is difficult to occur, i.e., dent resistance. FIG. 5A is
a sectional view showing a state in which a load P is imposed on a panel
surface 200 of a panel part 201 through an indentor 150 having a semi-spherical
tip. FIG. 5B shows a load-removed state, in which such a dent
151 of depth d as shown in FIG. 5C is formed in a loaded portion B.</p>
    <p num="0025">The larger a critical load P of inducing a dent of depth d (e.g., 0.02
mm) which poses a problem as product, the higher the dent resistance. The
critical load P is designated a dent resistance load. It goes without saying
that the dent resistance load should be measured at unified test conditions
because the dent resistance load is influenced by the radius of curvature of 
the indentor tip or by the hardness of the indentor in case of the indentor
being an elastic indentor.</p>
    <p num="0026">Further, dent resistance is influenced by the thickness of a panel
part and the yield strength of the material used. Dent resistance becomes
lower with a decrease of the panel thickness and yield strength. Therefore,
for reducing the panel part thickness to reduce the weight of the panel part,
it is necessary to increase the strength of the panel surface so as to prevent
deterioration of the dent resistance.</p>
    <p num="0027">FIG. 6 illustrates a method of sampling a tensile specimen from a
panel surface. The aforesaid yield strength indicates a yield strength
determined using a tensile specimen 202 cut out from a portion of the panel
part 201 which portion involves the problem of dent resistance, as shown in
FIG. 6.</p>
    <p num="0028">FIG. 7 schematically illustrates a relation between a stretch strain
(e) and a tensile stress (σ) (tensile load/original sectional area of specimen)
in a tension test for a sheet blank and also in a tension test ("panel tension
test" hereinafter) using the specimen sampled from the panel part, i.e., a
stress-strain diagram.</p>
    <p num="0029">In the same figure, a curve OAB represents the result of the blank
tension test, in which the point A is a yield point, while a curve O'A'B is a
stress-strain diagram in the panel tension test, with point A' being a yield
point. A clear difference between the two curves is a difference between the
stress at point A and the stress at point A'. A yield point stress (σA')
("panel surface yield point stress" hereinafter) in the panel tension test is
larger than a yield point stress (σA) ("blank yield point stress" hereinafter)
in the blank tension test. This is due to the influence of work hardening
caused by the imposition of a permanent strain on point O' in the panel 
manufacture.</p>
    <p num="0030">Since a dent which causes a problem in the appearance beauty is
formed by very small plastic deformation of a panel part under the action of
a local external force, it is presumed that the larger the panel surface yield
point stress (σA'), the more improved the dent resistance.</p>
    <p num="0031">The panel parts referred to previously have heretofore been
manufactured by press stamping of sheet metal.</p>
    <p num="0032">FIGS. 8A, 8B, and 8C illustrate tools used in press stamping, a state
of stamping, and an example of a formed part. FIG. 8A illustrates a state
in which a blank 203 is set on a die 204 fixed to a press bed 211 and a
peripheral portion 203b of the blank is binded against a die surface 204a at
a predetermined load with use of a blank holder 205, the blank holder 205
being attached to outer slide 212 which has been moved down from above by
means of a drive unit (not shown).</p>
    <p num="0033">At this time, the peripheral portion of the blank is clamped with
concave and convex portions 208 ("beads" hereinafter) formed opposedly on
both die surface 204a and blank holder surface 205b around a die cavity
204e. Next, a punch 206 attached to inner slide 213 which has been
brought down from above by another drive unit (not shown) is moved down
through a space formed inside the blank holder. When the punch 206
comes into contact with a sheet blank 203a positioned within a die cavity, a
tensile force acts on the blank because the peripheral portion of the blank is
pressed by both die and blank holder.</p>
    <p num="0034">With descent of the punch, the said tensile force increases and the
peripheral portion of the blank is pulled in toward the die cavity.</p>
    <p num="0035">FIG. 8B shows a state in which the punch has descended to a bottom
of the die cavity and a stretch formed portion (also referred to as "panel 
surface") 207a is formed between a punch surface 206a and a die bottom
204b. Thereafter, the punch and subsequently the blank holder are raised
and a formed part 207 is taken out.</p>
    <p num="0036">FIG. 8C illustrates the formed part. Bead patterns 207d formed by
the beads 208 remain on a peripheral portion ("flange" hereinafter) 207b of
the formed part. In steps which follow the flange is cut off to obtain the
panel part 201.</p>
    <p num="0037">In the above press stamping it is important that the stretch formed
portion, or the panel surface, be allowed to undergo a stretch deformation
with a tensile force.</p>
    <p num="0038">The first reason is that in case of the panel surface being a curved
surface and if stretch deformation is extremely small, the product is
prevented from having a predetermined radius of curvature due to an
elastic recovery. In this case there also arises an inconvenience such that a
elastic stiffness (difficulty of elastic deflection) of the panel surface is low
and there occurs "canning" when a local load is applied to the panel surface.</p>
    <p num="0039">The second reason is that if an increase in yield stress (σA') of the
panel surface induced by stretch deformation is small, the foregoing dent
resistance becomes insufficient.</p>
    <p num="0040">The material of the panel surface is in a biaxially stretched state
under the action of a surrounding tensile force, and for increasing the
amount of stretch deformation of the panel surface it is necessary to
increase the tensile force acting on the panel surface during press forming.
The larger the strength and thickness of the metallic sheet and the area of
the panel surface are, the larger the tensile force required for stretching the
panel surface is. This tensile force is created by resistance ("drawing
resistance" hereinafter) which is induced when the flange is pulled into the 
die cavity by the punch. The larger the holding force (also referred to as
"blank holder force" hereinafter) of the blank holder and the larger the
flange area, the higher the drawing resistance.</p>
    <p num="0041">However, the blank holder force is restricted by the capacity of the
press machine used and the flange area is set to a minimum area from the
standpoint of blank yield, so with these means it is difficult to ensure a
required drawing resistance. The bead compensates for the deficiency in
the drawing resistance. A drawing resistance is created by a bending
deformation induced when the flange passes the bead. Usually, the bead is
arranged at a position where the drawing resistance of the flange is small,
such as a straight side portion of the die cavity contour, as shown in FIG. 8C.</p>
    <p num="0042">In press stamping, a problem is encountered such that the drawing
resistance is difficult to be transmitted directly as a force of deforming the
panel surface. The following two are considered as factors of this problem.</p>
    <p num="0043">According to the first factor, a friction occurs between the punch
surface and a punch shoulder 206b and this frictional force suppresses the
stretch deformation of the panel surface. The larger the area of the punch
surface is, the more influential the friction is.</p>
    <p num="0044">The second factor is a bending at the punch shoulder. For the
material to stretch at the panel surface it is necessary that the material
moves to the side wall through the punch shoulder. This is obstructed by
both bend and friction at the punch shoulder. The smaller the profile
radius of the punch shoulder is, the greater the influence thereof is.</p>
    <p num="0045">Since the stretch deformation of the panel surface is suppressed by
the above factors, it is difficult to increase the stretch deformation of the
panel surface even if a forming depth (H) shown in FIG. 8C is increased. A
value ("equivalent strain of the stretched formed portion" or "ε eq" 
hereinafter) obtained by converting a biaxial tensile elongation on the panel
surface by press stamping into a uniaxial tensile elongation is 2% or so at
most and thus the deficiency in dent resistance becomes a problem even if
the elastic stiffness is satisfied.</p>
    <p num="0046">Further increasing the equivalent strain of the stretch formed
portion and improving the yield stress (σA') of the panel surface by work
hardening is difficult with the above press stamping method and there has
been adopted the thinking that a strength characteristic of a metallic sheet
blank is to be selected so as to satisfy a panel surface yield stress (σA')
required for dent resistance even if ε eq is small. That is, in case of
decreasing the thickness of a panel part for the reduction of weight, which
brings a decrease in dent resistance, it is necessary to change to a metallic
sheet of a higher strength so as not to cause a lowering of dent resistance.
For example, what is called a high strength steel sheet has so far been used.</p>
    <p num="0047">As the yield point stress of blank increases, an elastic recovery after
press forming becomes larger, thus giving rise to the problem that a
predetermined product shape cannot be obtained. Thus, an upper limit is
encountered in the yield point stress (σA) of blank. Generally there is
used a blank having a yield point stress of 280 Mpa or less.</p>
    <p num="0048">As noted above, since ε eq obtained in press stamping is 2% or so at
most, the panel surface yield point stress (σA') is 320 MPa or so at most.
Therefore, it is inevitably required to select a suitable sheet blank thickness
so as to satisfy a required dent resistance at such a panel surface yield point
stress, and thus a limit is encountered in reducing the thickness and weight
of a panel part.</p>
    <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0049">The present invention has been accomplished in view of the above-mentioned
problems and it is an object of the invention to provide a sheet
hydroforming method wherein a pressurized fluid can be injected between
mating surfaces of two blanks easily and without leakage of the fluid,
further provide a forming die used therein and a formed part on workpiece
obtained by the method, as well as the above method able to improve dent
resistance, a forming die used therein and a formed product obtained by the
method.</p>
    <p num="0050">For achieving the above-mentioned object, the inventors in the
present case have studied the foregoing conventional problems and obtained
the following knowledge.
<sl><li>a) A thru-hole to introduce a pressurized fluid, which leads to a
holding surface of a die, is formed in the die, and a pierced hole to introduce
the fluid formed in a portion of stacked metallic sheets, which portion is in
contact with the holding surface of the die, is positioned with the thru-hole
formed in the die, then the pressurized fluid is injected between mating
surfaces of the metallic sheets from the thru-hole in the die through the
pierced hole on blank, allowing a channel to be formed to introduce the
pressurized fluid into a portion to be bulged. According to this method, the
fluid can be injected between the mating surfaces of the metallic sheets
easily without leakage thereof, whereby the forming work can be done
efficiently.</li><li>b) A dent load of a formed part increases with an increase in
equivalent strain of the stretch formed portion of workpiece, but when the
equivalent strain of the stretch formed portion (also called "equivalent
strain of the panel surface" hereinafter) saturates at 10% or so and
increases to a further extent, the dent resistance load becomes lower. This 
is because a lowering in dent resistance caused by a decrease in thickness of
stretch formed portion becomes more influential than the improvement in
dent resistance of the stretch formed portion of workpiece based on work
hardening.</li></sl></p>

above knowledge and the gist thereof is summarized in the following points

the one die, and a channel-forming groove is formed in a holding surface of
the other die, said channel-forming groove being extended to said die
cavities from a position opposed to said thru-hole formed in the one die.</li></sl></li><li>(8) A sheet hydroforming die as described in the above (7), wherein
one or both of said dies has (have) means for opening a fluid discharge
hole(s) on a stretch formed portion on workpiece after forming.</li><li>(9) A sheet hydroformed part obtained by introducing a fluid
between mating surfaces of two stacked metallic sheets and pressuring the
fluid to stretch form the metallic sheets, characterized in that a convex fluid
channel extending to a stretch formed portion is formed and a pierced hole
for introducing the fluid is formed in a position opposed to said convex fluid
channel.</li><li>(10) A sheet hydroformed part obtained by introducing a fluid

strain of a stretch formed portion of the formed part is 2% to 10%.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0052">The two stacked metallic sheets are obtained by superimposing one
metallic sheet on the other metallic sheet. As one or both of such blanks
there are included a laminate of plural metallic sheets and a composite of
both a metallic sheet and a sheet of a non-metallic material such as plastic.</p>

    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
    <p num="0054">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail
hereinunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <heading>1) Working Process</heading>
    <p num="0055">FIGS. 9A and 9B are perspective views showing an example of
blanks used in the hydroforming method of the present invention, of which
FIG. 9A shows a blank 1 and FIG. 9B shows a blank 2 having a pierced hole
for the injection of fluid in a predetermined position, the pierced hole being
formed, for example, by punching or by a laser cutting method. As to the
diameter, d, of the pierced hole 3, it will be described later. The pierced
hole 3 may be provided in a plural number. Although blanks will
hereinafter be described as two blanks 1 and 2, the present invention is also
applicable to the case where one or both of the blanks 1 and 2 is (are) a
laminate(s) of plural metallic sheets or a stacked composite(s) of a metallic
sheet and a non-metallic sheet such as plastic.</p>
    <p num="0056">The present invention is further applicable even to the case where
one or both of the blanks 1 and 2 is (are) a tailored blank(s) obtained by
bonding edge portions or the vicinity thereof of plural metallic sheets of the
same material and different thicknesses or plural metallic sheets of the
same thickness and formed of different materials by a suitable boding
method such as welding.</p>
    <p num="0057">FIGS. 10A, 10B, and 10C are perspective views showing different
modes of double sheet blanks each comprising blanks 1 and 2 superimposed
together and employable in the present invention. FIG. 10A shows a
double sheet blank 4 of merely stacked blanks. For preventing the
constituent blanks from being disjoined during handling, the blanks may be 
bonded at several positions near their edge portions by spot welding for
example. FIG. 10B shows a double sheet blank 5 obtained by
superimposing the blanks 1 and 2 together and welding the two into an
integral mass throughout the whole circumference by laser welding for
example. As to the position of a welded line 5b, it will be described later.
The pierced hole 3 is formed in a position inside a welded line and
positioned with a thru-hole formed in a die for introducing a pressurized
medium when the blank is set on the die, which thru-hole will be described
later. FIG. 10C shows an example of a double sheet blank 7 of a further
different mode. Interfaces of the blanks 1 and 2 are integrally bonded in a
hatched planar area ("bonded area" hereinafter) located outside a closed
curve 7b ("inside contour line of bonded area" hereinafter) which is
represented by a dash-double dot line, by bonding with adhesive or brazing.
The hatched area represents a bonded area on mating surfaces of the blanks
1 and 2. As to the blank bonded area, it will be described later. Also in
this case, a pierced hole on blank may be formed in a position inside the
bonded area which position may be set in the same manner as is the case
with the welded line 5b of the double sheet blank 5 in FIG. 10B.</p>
    <p num="0058">FIG. 11 is a sectional view of a die portion for explaining an example
of the hydroforming method of the present invention using the double sheet
blank 4. The same figure shows a state in which the double sheet blank 4
is set on a holding surface 11a of a lower die 11 fixed to a bed 20 of a press
machine (not shown), a slide 21 of the press machine with an upper die 10
attached thereto is brought down with a drive unit (not shown), allowing a
holding surface 10a of the upper die to come into contact with the double
sheet blank, and the slide is pressed with a pressing device (not shown) to
clamp a peripheral plane portion 4a ("flange" hereinafter) of the double 
sheet blank. In the upper and lower dies 10, 11 are respectively formed die
cavities 10b and 11b having the same inner contour shape as an outer
contour shape of product.</p>
    <p num="0059">In an outer side face of the lower die a thru-hole 11d is formed for
introducing a pressurized medium which thru-hole lead to the holding
surface of the lower die. The lower die is sideways provided with a
connector 14a so as to permit connection with and disconnection from piping
14. In the holding surface of the upper die is formed a channel-forming
groove 10d in a position opposed to the thru-hole formed in the die so as to
extend to the upper die cavity.</p>
    <p num="0060">In a bottom of the lower die cavity a drain hole 11e is formed leading
to piping 15 which is connected removably to the connector 15a. Air
exhaust thru-holes 10c and 11c leading to the exterior of the die portion
from the die cavities 10b and 11b are formed in the upper and lower dies
respectively. The air exhaust thru-holes are formed, for example, in round
corner portions 10i and 11i so that indentation thereof may not remain in
the resulting formed part.</p>
    <p num="0061">FIGS. 12A, 12B, and 12C are enlarged diagrams of a portion C
enclosed with a dotted line in FIG. 11, of which FIG. 12A is a diagram for
explaining a fluid sealing method in an opening of the thru-hole 11d in the
lower die which opening faces the holding surface of the die. As shown in
the same figure, a circular groove 11f is formed in the holding surface 11a of
the lower die so as to surround the thru-hole 11d. An O-ring 16 made of an
elastic material such as rubber is fitted in the circular groove. An inside
diameter (D) of the circular groove, as well as the width and depth of the
same groove, may be determined in accordance with the inside diameter and
thickness of the O-ring and on the basis of, for example, JIS B2406. </p>
    <p num="0062">The pierced hole 3 on blank is located at the same position as the
thru-hole 11d and its diameter (d) is determined smaller than the inside
diameter (D) of the circular groove. The holding surfaces of the upper and
lower dies are formed with a bead 10g and a bead groove 11g respectively at
a position outside the channel-forming groove 10d and thus a local concaveconvex
pattern ("bead pattern" hereinafter) 25e is formed on a flange 4a.
Vertical positions of the bead and the bead groove may be reversed. The
bead pattern is formed by clamping the double sheet blank with the upper
and lower dies. As to the role of the bead pattern 25e, it will be described
later.</p>
    <p num="0063">FIG. 12B is a sectional view as seen in an arrowed direction E-E in
FIG. 12A. The width (w) of the fluid channel is set equal to or somewhat
smaller than the inside diameter (D) of the circular groove. As a result,
with a certain pressing force of the holding surface of the upper die to the
blanks 1 and 2, the O-ring is crushed elastically within the circular groove
and the resulting surface pressure brings the space between the thru-hole
11d and the blank 2 into a sealed state. Fluid is fed from an external tank
(not shown) through piping and the thru-hole 11d by means of a pump (not
shown). The fluid thus fed first fills the pierced hole 3, and with the
pressure of the fluid the upper sheet blank 1 is pushed up locally toward the
channel-forming groove.</p>
    <p num="0064">FIG. 12C shows this state, in which the blanks 1 and 2 are bulged
within the upper and lower die cavities 10b, 11b with pressurized fluid 17
which has entered through the gap formed between both blanks. Of course,
for effecting the stretch forming work efficiently, there may be used a double
sheet blank having plural pierced holes 3, and the same number of such
structures as indicated by arrow C in FIG. 11 may be provided at 
corresponding positions of the upper and lower dies.</p>
    <p num="0065">As the fluid, water emulsion with oil or fat for rust prevention is
most suitable in point of cost.</p>
    <p num="0066">In the course of the stretch forming process, the air present within
the upper and lower die cavities is discharged to the exterior gradually
through the air exhaust thru-holes 10c and 11c.</p>
    <p num="0067">The steps which follow the pressurized medium injection step will
now be described in more detail. FIG. 13 illustrates a state in which a
bulging deformation with fluid has been started in the forming step. At
this stage, the blanks 1 and 2 present within the die cavities bulge centrally
in a dome shape. A stretch deformation of the blanks becomes the largest
centrally of the dome-like bulged portion. The central bulging proceeds
until the bulge top comes into contact with die cavity bottoms 10h and 11h.
Thereafter, the area of contact with the die cavity bottoms becomes wider.
The air present within the die cavities is discharged to the exterior
gradually through the air exhaust thru-hole in the course of stretch
formation.</p>
    <p num="0068">FIG. 14 shows a completed state of blank bulging in the die cavities.
There is obtained a stretch formed part 30 composed of upper and lower
formed parts 25, 26. Subsequently, the pressure of the pressurized medium
is reduced, then the upper die is raised, the stretch formed part is lifted and
taken out from the lower die, and medium is discharged from the pierced
hole 3 on blank. At this time, the medium spilling into the lower die cavity
is discharged from the drain hole 11e, then passes through a removable joint
15a and is returned for re-use into a tank (not shown) through piping. It
goes without saying that if plural thru-holes for introducing pressurized
medium are formed, the discharge of the medium can be done efficiently. </p>
    <p num="0069">In case of forming a through hole in the stretch formed portion, a
punching work may be done subsequent to the stretch forming work as
shown, for example, in FIGS. 15A and 15B. In this case, as shown in FIG.
15A, a hydraulic cylinder 13 equipped with a piercing punch 12 is installed
at a predetermined position within the die cavities, the blanks are allowed
to contact the whole inner contour portions of the upper and lower die
cavities, thereafter, while the pressurized medium is maintained at a
predetermined pressure level, the hydraulic cylinder 13 is actuated to move
the punch 12 forward to pierce a hole as shown in FIG. 15B for example. If
a partial roundness 12a is formed at a peripheral edge portion of the tip of
the punch 12, it is possible to pierce a hole without separation of slug 51,
thus eliminating the necessity of slug recovery. Of course, a separative
punching which premises the recovery of slug may also be done. After the
end of the punching work, the pressure of the pressurized medium is
reduced and the piercing punch is retracted. The resulting punched thru-hole
on the lower side, indicated at 52, is also employable as a discharge
hole for the medium. If such a punched thru-hole is formed also on the
upper die side, it can be used as an air intake port at the time of discharging
the medium, whereby the discharge of pressurized medium can be
performed efficiently.</p>
    <p num="0070">FIGS 16A, 16B, and 16C are perspective views of formed parts, of
which FIG. 16A shows a stretch formed part 30 just after the hydroforming.
A protuberance 25b, which corresponds to the channel forming groove 10d,
is formed adjacent to a stretch formed portion 25a of workpiece. On the
flange 4a is formed a bead pattern 25e in a closed curve shape. The reason
for this will be stated later. Thereafter, the flange is cut off along the
position of a closed curve 25c (also referred to as "trimming line" 
hereinafter) located inside the bead pattern by a known means such as the
use of a trimming die or by laser trimming. FIGS. 16B and 16C illustrate
panel parts 31 and 32 obtained by separation up and down after cutting off
the flange. In the case where the double sheet blank is a mere stack of two
blanks, the flange may be cut off after separation into the upper and lower
formed parts 25, 26.</p>
    <p num="0071">The following description is now provided about cutting off the
flange of a stretch formed part obtained by the hydroforming method
illustrated in FIG. 11 and using the double sheet blanks 5 and 7 shown in
FIGS. 10B and 10C.</p>
    <p num="0072">FIGS. 17A and 17B are perspective views of stretch formed parts
30a and 30b corresponding to the double sheet blanks 5 and 7, respectively.
In each of both stretch formed parts, a protuberance 25b corresponding to
the channel-forming groove 10d is formed in adjacency to a stretch formed
portion 25a, and outside the protuberance 25b is formed a partial bead
pattern 25e. The reason for this will be stated later. A welded line 5b1 on
flange in FIG. 17A indicates in which position of the stretch formed part the
welded line 5b of the double sheet blank 5 is located, while an inside contour
line 7b1 of bonded area on the flange in FIG. 17B indicates in which position
of the stretch formed part the inside contour line 7b of bonded area on the
double sheet blank 7 is located. By cutting off the flange along a trimming
line 25c located outside the welded line 5b1 or outside the inside contour
line 7b1 there is obtained a product with the welded line or the bonded area
left thereon.</p>
    <p num="0073">FIG. 18 is a sectional view showing an example of a flange cutting
method for a stretch formed part 30a with use of a trimming die 300. The
stretch formed part 30a is set on a lower die 300a, then while a flange 5a is 
clamped with a work holder 300c which is pressed with a spring 300d, an
upper die 300b is brought down with a drive unit (not shown) to cut off the
flange 5a. For allowing a welded line 5b1 of the formed part 30a to remain
inside a trimming line 25c, the position of the welded line 5b on blank in
FIG. 10B lies between a contour 25d of the stretch formed portion of
workpiece and the trimming line 25c.</p>
    <p num="0074">In the case of the double sheet blank 7 shown in FIG. 10C, a planar
shape of the inside contour line 7b of bonded area on the blank 7 is set so
that the inside contour line 7b1 of bonded area remains between the
periphery 25d of the stretch formed portion and the trimming line 25c.</p>
    <p num="0075">Of course, it is possible to cut the double sheet blank in such a
manner that the welded line 5b of the double sheet blank and the bonded
area thereof do not remain on product.</p>
    <heading>2) Function of Bead Pattern</heading>
    <p num="0076">In the hydroforming work shown in FIG. 11, the bead pattern
formed on the flange fulfills the following three functions.</p>
    <p num="0077">The first function is preventing pressurized medium from leaking to
the exterior of the flange from the blank interface upon clamping the double
sheet blank 4 shown in FIG. 10A between a bead and a bead groove with a
high surface pressure. If the leakage occurs, the pressure of the
pressurized medium lowers and it becomes impossible to obtain a
predetermined shape of product. For fulfilling this function it is preferable
that the bead pattern be formed throughout the whole circumference so as
to surround the upper and lower die cavities as shown in FIG. 16A.</p>
    <p num="0078">In the case where the flange thickness increases with draw-in of the
flange into the die cavities and if such an increase in flange thickness differs
depending on circumferential positions of the flange, the pressurized fluid 
will leak out to the exterior from the mating surfaces of the double sheet
blank, so it is necessary to minimize the draw-in of the flange into the die
cavities.</p>
    <p num="0079">In the case of the double sheet blank 5 shown in FIG. 10B, the whole
circumference is welded along the closed curve 5b, so even if the flange
thickness becomes non-uniform due to draw-in of the flange into the die
cavities, there is no fear of fluid leaking to the exterior of the flange from the
boundary of both upper and lower blanks, and thus the above first function
of the bead pattern is not needed. This is also the case where the bonded
area of the double sheet blank 7 shown in FIG. 10C has a bonding strength
high enough to prevent the leakage of fluid.</p>
    <p num="0080">The second function is inhibiting the movement of the flange in the
vicinity of the thru-hole which is formed in the lower die to introduce
pressurized medium. In the stretch forming process shown in FIGS. 13
and 14, if a force acting to pull in the flange toward the upper and lower die
cavities causes the flange to move and close the thru-hole formed in the
lower die, it becomes impossible to continue the stretch forming work.
Therefore, in the vicinity of the pierced hole on blank it is necessary that the
movement of the flange be inhibited by the bead pattern.</p>
    <p num="0081">It is for this reason that the bead pattern 25e is formed in the
vicinity of the protuberance 25b in the stretch formed parts 30a and 30b
using the double sheet blanks 5 and 7, as shown in FIGS. 17A and 17B.</p>
    <p num="0082">The third function is increasing the flange movement resistance for
increasing an equivalent strain of panel surface. As means for increasing
the movement resistance of the flange without forming the bead pattern it is
considered to increase the pressing force of the slide 21 and increase the
drawing resistance of the flange based on an increase of the flange area. 
However, in the former case there arises the problem of an increase in
equipment cost caused by an increase in size of the pressurizing equipment
and also in the latter case there arises the problem of a decrease in blank
yield.</p>
    <p num="0083">Forming the bead pattern is an effective means for inhibiting the
flange movement without giving rise to the above problems and for
increasing an equivalent strain of panel surface. The bead pattern for this
purpose may be formed throughout the whole circumference as in FIG. 16A
or at a position where the flange is apt to move toward the die cavities.
FIG. 19 shows an example thereof, in which bead patterns are formed along
straight side portions of the periphery of the stretch formed portion 25a.</p>
    <p num="0084">Thus, a sectional shape of each bead pattern and a position thereof
on the holding surface of the associated die may be selected according to the
type of the double sheet blank used and an equivalent strain of a stretch
formed portion which will be described later in such a manner as to fulfill
the foregoing three functions.</p>
    <heading>3) Equivalent Strain of Stretch Formed Portion</heading>
    <p num="0085">A description will be given below about a stretch deformation of
panel surfaces 25a and 26a of formed parts obtained by the hydroforming
process.</p>
    <p num="0086">In the hydroforming process, as noted earlier, a stretch deformation
caused by fluid begins with a central portion of the panel surface, as shown
in FIG. 13. Until the stretch formed portion comes into contact with the
bottoms of both upper and lower die cavities, the top of the stretch formed
portion undergoes the largest stretch deformation. Upon contact of the
stretch formed portion with the bottoms of both upper and lower die cavities,
increase of the stretch deformation of the contact area becomes small due to 
friction with the bottoms of the die cavities, but instead the stretch
deformation of the surrounding non-contact area increases, with the result
that the stretch deformation proceeds throughout the whole area of the
panel surface.</p>
    <p num="0087">Factors which dominate the amount of stretch deformation of the
panel surface are upper and lower die depths h1, h2, frictional coefficients
between the upper, lower die cavity bottoms 10h, 11h and metallic sheets,
and the amount of flange movement toward the die cavities. With an
increase of the upper and lower die depths, with a decrease of the frictional
coefficients and with a decrease in the amount of flange movement, the
amount of stretch deformation of the panel surface increases. Therefore, by
adjusting these factors it is possible to control the amount of stretch
deformation of the panel surface.</p>
    <p num="0088">For example, given that the direction in which there occurs the
maximum elongation is the arrow X in FIG. 16A, the foregoing equivalent
strain of panel surface is calculated by measuring a strain in the X direction
and a strain in an arrow Y direction orthogonal thereto and in accordance
with the following equation (1):
<st32:df xmlns:st32="http://www.ir-facility.org/ns/st32/" align="center">εeq=(2/√3) × √(εx<st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup> + εx × εy + εy<st32:sup pos="post">2</st32:sup>)</st32:df>
where, εeq: equivalent strain of panel surface

   εx: strain in X direction (logarithmic strain)

   εy: strain in Y direction (logarithmic strain)</p>
    <p num="0089">The equivalent strain (εeq) is calculated as a logarithmic strain,
but for ease of understanding, it will be described below in a converted form
into a conventional strain represented by %.</p>
    <p num="0090">The present inventors have searched a relation between the
equivalent strain of stretch formed portion, or panel surface, and dent 
resistance in connection with the hydroforming.</p>
    <p num="0091">Two blanks of a square shape having a one-side length of 600 mm
each constituted by a steel sheet having a thickness of 0.7 mm, a yield point
of 210 MPa and a tensile strength of 370 MPa were put one on the other and
welded throughout the whole circumference thereof to provide a double
sheet blank 5. Then, stretch formed parts were formed and measured for
an equivalent strain of panel surface, using five sets of upper and lower dies
10, 11 each having upper and lower die cavities 10b, 11b in FIG. 11 of a
square shape 400 mm in one side in plane and each having a bead pattern
25c throughout the whole circumference thereof, the upper and lower die
cavities 10b, 11b having bottoms 10h and 11h of a curvature radius of 2000
mm, the bottoms 10h and 11h in the five sets of upper and lower dies being
20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mm, respectively, in depth (h1 and h2).</p>
    <p num="0092">Further, in each of the formed parts, a flange portion was cut off and
the formed part was separated into upper and lower formed parts, then a
concentrated load was applied to a central portion of panel surface through
a semi-spherical indentor made of urethane rubber (Hardness Hs = 70) with
a radius of 25 mm. After release of the load there was determined a load
(dent resistance load) of creating a dent of 0.02 mm in depth.</p>
    <p num="0093">FIG. 20 is a diagram of a test result showing a relation between an
equivalent strain of panel surface (stretch formed portion) and a dent
resistance load, both being plotted depth by depth. From the illustrated
result it is seen that the dent resistance load increases with an increase in
the equivalent strain of panel surface, but the dent resistance load reaches
saturation at an equivalent strain of panel surface of 10% or so, and that at
larger equivalent strains the dent resistance load decreases. This is
because a lowering of dent resistance caused by a decrease of thickness of 
stretch formed portion becomes more influential than the improvement of
dent resistance based on work hardening of the stretch formed portion of the
each formed part.</p>
    <p num="0094">For the panel part, not only the dent resistance, but also a elastic
stiffness of panel surface against a concentrated load at a dent-free
condition is required. Since the elastic stiffness decreases with a decrease
in thickness of stretch formed portion, even if an equivalent strain of panel
surface not improving the dent resistance is given, there accrues no
advantage.</p>
    <p num="0095">In view of the above result an upper limit value of the equivalent
strain of panel surface was set at 10%. On the other hand, as to a panel of
less than 2% in terms of the equivalent strain of panel surface, a lower limit
value of the equivalent strain of panel surface was set at 2% because it can
be obtained also by the conventional press stampig method.</p>
    <heading>4) Forming Method in Another Mode</heading>
    <p num="0096">FIGS. 21A and 21B illustrate another mode of a forming method
according to the present invention. FIG. 21A is a perspective view of
blanks 1 and 2, with a protuberance 1a of a size capable of being received
within the channel-forming groove 10d being preformed in the blank 1 by,
for example, press stamping at the position of the channel-forming groove
10d shown in FIG. 11. FIG. 21B is a sectional view of a holding surface
portion of the upper and lower dies 10, 11 illustrated in FIG. 11, showing a
state in which a double sheet blank 5 obtained by a full-circled welding of
both blanks 1 and 2 is clamped by the upper and lower dies 10, 11.</p>
    <p num="0097">By using such blanks it is possible to feed a fluid between the
mating surfaces of the blanks smoothly at a relatively low pressure at the
beginning of the stretch forming work. This is because at the beginning of 
the stretch forming work it is not required to perform the same work for the
protuberance 1a within the channel-forming groove 10d under a hydraulic
pressure. The fluid fed from the thru-hole 11d immediately fills the
internal space of the protuberance la formed on the blank 1 and both blanks
1 and 2 can be bulged by an increase of the fluid pressure. In this case, in
order for the fluid to be fed smoothly, it is recommended that the length of
protuberance 1a be set at a length which reaches the die cavity 10b.</p>
    <p num="0098">FIGS. 22A, 22B, and 22C illustrate another mode of a method which
permits the stretch forming work to be done easily in the initial stage. FIG.
22A is a perspective view of a blank 1 and a blank 2, the blank 2 having a
pierced hole 3 formed in a protuberance 2a which projects in a direction
opposite to blank mating surfaces. FIG. 22B is a sectional view of a holding
portion of an upper die 10 and a lower die 11, showing a state in which a
blank 5 obtained by full-circled welding of the blanks 1 and 2 is clamped
with both upper and lower dies 10, 11, the lower die 11 having a recess 11h
of about the same inner contour shape as the outer contour shape of the
protuberance 2a.</p>
    <p num="0099">Since the protuberance 2a is in a three-dimensional shape, it has
rigidity, and a sealing effect is created when an O-ring 16 is crushed with
the pressing force at the time of clamping the double sheet blank by the
upper and lower dies. For ensuring the sealing effect, the depth of the
aforesaid recess is set equal to or slightly smaller than the depth of the
protuberance on blank. Further, since the force of crushing the O-ring in
the vertical direction is transmitted to the O-ring through the side wall of
the protuberance, it is recommended to set the size of the protuberance in
such a manner that the O-ring is positioned near the side wall of the
protuberance. In this case, since the O-ring is received within a recess 
formed in the lower die, there accrues an advantage that the fear of the O-ring
coming off or being damaged for example at the time of setting the
double sheet blank onto the lower die is small. There also is an advantage
that the positioning of the double sheet blank and the dies relative to each
other becomes easier by positioning the recess 11h formed in the lower die
and the protuberance 2a on the blank 2 with each other.</p>
    <p num="0100">Fluid fed from a thru-hole 11d formed in the bottom of the recess 11h
immediately fills the internal space of the protuberance 2a, the blank 1 is
pushed up locally toward a channel-forming groove 10d with the fluid
pressure, and the fluid which has entered between the blanks 1 and 2
causes both blanks to bulge within die cavities 10b and 11b.</p>
    <p num="0101">In the modes illustrated in FIGS. 21A, 21B and 22A, 22B there is an
effect such that the pressure of the fluid injected into the protuberance 1a or
2a causes the O-ring 16 to be pushed against the lower die 11 to provide a
seal before bulging the blanks 1 and 2.</p>
    <p num="0102">Although the above modes are of the double sheet blank 5 obtained
by full-circled welding of the upper and lower blanks 1, 2, this is also the
case with the double sheet blanks 4 and 7.</p>
    <p num="0103">Although in the above modes two planar blanks are used as portions
to be bulged by the hydroforming work, the portion to be bulged of one or
both blanks may be formed in a three-dimensional shape beforehand.</p>
    <p num="0104">FIGS. 23A, 23B, 23C, and 23D show examples of forming blanks in
three-dimensional shapes beforehand by press stamping or any other
suitable method and welding them throughout the whole circumference.
FIG. 23A shows a blank ("preformed blank" hereinafter) 41 having a
preformed portion 41a received within the upper die cavity and also having
a protuberance 41b adjacent to the preformed portion 41a and received 
within the channel-forming groove 10d. FIG. 23B shows a preformed blank
42 having a preformed portion 42a received within the lower die cavity 11b
and also having a pierced hole 3.</p>
    <p num="0105">Depths H1 and H2 of the preformed portions 41a and 42a,
respectively, may be set appropriately in conformity with the shape of a
hydroformed product to be obtained. Another part may be bonded to a
predetermined inside position of each of the preformed portions 41a and 42a
by a suitable method such as, for example, welding, adhesion, or brazing.</p>
    <p num="0106">FIG. 23C shows a double sheet blank ("preformed double sheet
blank" hereinafter) 43 obtained by superimposing the preformed blanks 41
and 42 one on the other and laser-welding flanges 41c and 42c along a line
5b. As shown in FIG. 10C, the bonding may be done by adhesion or brazing.
After the superimposition of both blanks, the vicinity of an edge portion may
be partially bonded by, say, spot welding for ease of handling.</p>
    <p num="0107">FIG. 23D is a sectional view taken along a dot-dash line G in FIG.
23C. The feed of fluid from the pierced hole 3 to an internal space 43a may
be done at a low fluid pressure. Since it can be done in a short time, it is
possible to shorten the time required for the hydroforming work. Further,
since the bulging action in the hydroforming work is applied to the
preformed portions 41a and 42a having respective depths, it is possible to
obtain a deeper formed part than in hydroforming flat sheets.</p>
    <heading>EXAMPLES</heading>
    <heading>Example 1 :</heading>
    <p num="0108">A cold-rolled steel sheet SPCC (JIS G3141) having a thickness of 0.7
mm and a tensile strength of 320 MPa was cut into such blanks 1 and 2 of a
square shape having a one-side length of 600 mm as shown in FIG. 9A. </p>
    <p num="0109">A pierced hole 3 having a diameter of 16 mm was formed in the
blank 2. Both blanks 1 and 2 were put one on the other and laser-welded
to afford a double sheet blank 5 having a welded line 5b such as that shown
in FIG. 10B.</p>
    <p num="0110">Using upper and lower dies 10, 11 having respective die cavities 10b
and 11b shown in FIG. 11 which die cavities have a planar size of 400 mm
square and a depth h1 = h2 = 30 mm, the double sheet blank 5 was clamped
with a holding force of 4900 kN. An O-ring (JIS B2406) having a nominal
No. P24 was fitted in a circular groove 11f, the circular groove 11f having an
outside diameter of 30 mm, an inside diameter D of 20.6 mm, and a depth of
2.7 mm, to provide a seal between the pierced hole 3 and a thru-hole 11d
formed in the lower die and having an inside diameter of 8 mm.</p>
    <p num="0111">Then, the pressure of fluid (water emulsion) introduced into the
pierced hole 3 from the thru-hole 11d was raised to 9.8 MPa to push up the
blank 1 locally into a channel-forming groove 10d having a width w of 10
mm and a depth h of 2 mm, as shown in FIG. 12B, allowing the fluid to be
introduced between the blanks 1 and 2 and thereby causing the blanks 1
and 2 to bulge into the die cavities 10b and 11b respectively. The fluid
pressure was finally increased to 29.4 MPa and the bulging work was
finished. Keeping the pressure of the medium, a punch 12 built into the
lower die 11, as shown in FIG. 15B, was moved to pierce a thru-hole 52
having a planar size of 30 mm square without separation of slug 51 and the
pressure of the medium was decreased. Thereafter, the fluid was
discharged from the punched thru-hole 52 to get the stretch formed part 30a
shown in Fig. 17A. Then, by the method shown in FIG. 18, the flange 5a
was cut off along the trimming line 25c located outside the welded line 5b1
of the formed part to obtain a product. </p>

aluminum sheet was also cut out a blank 2 of the same size as the blank 1,
the blank 2 having a pierced hole 3 with a diameter of 16 mm. The blank 2,
which was coated with an epoxy resin-based adhesive in a hatched area
shown in FIG. 10C, was superimposed on the blank 1, followed by
thermocompression bonding at 150°C, to fabricate a double sheet blank 7 in
which the adhesive was hardened.</p>

seal between the pierced hole 3 and a thru-hole 11d formed in the lower die
and having an inside diameter of 8 mm. The pressure of fluid (water
emulsion) which has filled into the pieced hole 3 through the thru-hole 11d
was raised to 4.9 MPa to push up the blank 1 locally into such a channel-forming

shown in FIG. 12B, allowing the fluid to be introduced between the mating
surfaces of both blanks 1 and 2 and thereby causing both blanks to bulge
into the die cavities 10b and 11b respectively. The fluid pressure was
finally increased to 14.7 MPa and the bulging work was finished. Keeping
the pressure of the medium a punch 12 built into the lower die 11 was 
moved to pierce, a thru-hole 52 having a planar size of 30 mm square
without separation of slug 51, as shown in FIG. 15B, and the pressure of the

decreased. Thereafter, the fluid was discharged from the thru-hole 52 to
get a stretch formed part 30a shown in FIG. 17A. Thereafter, a flange 5a of
this stretch formed part was cut to cut off the spot-welded portion, to obtain
two upper and lower stretch formed parts.</p>
    <heading>Example 5 :</heading>
    <p num="0122">A cold-rolled steel sheet SPCC (JIS G3141) having a thickness of 0.7
mm and a tensile strength of 320 MPa was cut into a square blank having a
one-side length of 600 mm. This square blank was then subjected to press
stamping into such a preformed blank 41 as shown in FIG. 23A, the
preformed blank 41 having a preformed portion 41a with a depth H1 of 20
mm and also having a protuberance 41b. Likewise, from the same cold-rolled
steel sheet was cut out a square blank having a one-side length of 600 
mm. This square blank was then subjected to press stamping to form a
preformed portion 42a having a depth H2 of 20 mm, as shown in FIG. 23B.
Further, a pierced hole 3 having a diameter of 16 mm was formed in the
same blank to obtain a preformed blank 42.</p>
    <p num="0123">Both preformed blanks 41 and 42 were then put one on the other
and laser-welded to fabricate a preformed double sheet blank 43 having a
bonded line 5b shown in FIG. 23C.</p>
    <p num="0124">Then, using upper and lower dies 10, 11 respectively having such die
cavities 10b and 11b as shown in FIG. 11, the die cavities 10b and 11b
having a planar size of 400 mm square and a depth of h1 = h2 = 40 mm, the
double sheet blank 5 was clamped with a clamping force of 4900 kN.</p>
    <p num="0125">An O-ring (JIS B2406) having a nominal No. P24 was fitted in a
circular groove 11f having an outside diameter of 30 mm, an inside diameter
D of 20.6 mm and a depth of 2.7 mm to provide a seal between the pierced
hole 3 and a thru-hole 11d formed in the lower die and having an inside
diameter of 8 mm. An internal space 43a of the preformed double sheet
blank was filled with fluid (water emulsion) introduced from the thru-hole
11d. Then, the fluid pressure was increased to 29. 4 MPa and the bulging
work within the die cavities 10b and lib was finished.</p>
    <p num="0126">Keeping the pressure of the medium, a punch 12 built into the lower
die 11 was moved to pierce a thru-hole 52 having a planar size of 30 mm
square without separation of slug 51, as shown in FIG. 15B, and the
pressure of the medium was decreased. Thereafter, the fluid was
discharged from the punched thru-hole 52 to get a stretch formed part 30a
shown in FIG. 17A. Then, by the method shown in FIG. 18, a flange was
cut off along a trimming line 25c located outside a welded line 5b1 of the
stretch formed part to obtain a product. </p>
    <heading>Example 6 :</heading>
    <p num="0127">A square blank 1 shown in FIG. 9A, the blank 1 having a one-side
length of 600 mm and obtained by cutting a cold-rolled steel sheet SPCC
(JIS G3141) having a thickness of 0.7 mm and a tensile strength of 320 MPa,
and a blank 2 of the same material and size as the blank 1, the blank 2
having a pierced hole 3 with a diameter of 10 mm, were put one on the other
and spot-welded at four corners to facilitate handling, affording a double
sheet blank 4 shown in FIG. 10A.</p>
    <p num="0128">Then, the flange 5a of the double sheet blank 4 was clamped using
upper and lower dies 10, 11 respectively having such die cavities 10b and
11b as shown in FIG. 11 and having a bead 10b and a bead groove 11g
throughout the whole circumference around the die cavities, the die cavities
10b and 11b having a planar size of 400 mm square, a curvature radius of
respective bottoms 10h and 11h of 3000 mm and a depth of h1 = h2 = 40 mm.</p>
    <p num="0129">Then, an O-ring (JIS B2406) having a nominal No. P16 was fitted in
a circular groove 11f having an outside diameter of 20 mm, an inside
diameter D of 13.6 mm and a depth of 2 mm to provide a seal between the
pierced hole 3 and a thru-hole 11d formed in the lower die and having an
inside diameter of 8 mm. The pressure of the pressurized medium (water
emulsion) which has filled the pierced hole 3 from the thru-hole 11d was
raised to 9.8 MPa to push up the blank 1 locally into a channel-forming
groove 10d shown in FIG. 12B, the channel-forming groove 10d having a
width w of 13 mm and a depth h of 4 mm, allowing a pressurized medium to
be introduced between both blanks 1 and 2 and thereby causing both blanks
to bulge into the die cavities 10b and 11b respectively.</p>
    <p num="0130">The pressure of the pressurized medium was finally increased to
29.4 MPa, causing both blanks to contact the whole areas of the die cavity 
bottoms 10h and 11h. At this time, the amount of movement of the flange
5a toward the die cavities was 3 mm at most. Thereafter, the pressure of
the pressurized medium was decreased and the stretch formed part 30
shown in FIG. 16A was taken out from the dies, the medium was discharged
from the pierced hole 3, and the flange 5a of the formed part 30 was cut off
along a trimming line 25c located inside the bead pattern 25e to obtain two
panel parts 31 and 32 shown in FIGS. 16B and 16C respectively.</p>
    <p num="0131">An equivalent strain of panel surfaces 25a and 26a of the panel
parts 31 and 32 was 4%. Central portions of the panel surfaces 25a and
26a were checked for dent resistance by the foregoing method to find that
the dent resistance load was 196N.</p>
    <p num="0132">On the other hand, the blank 1 was press-stamped into the same
shape as the panel surfaces 25a and 26a by the method illustrated in FIGS.
8A, 8B, and 8C. An equivalent strain of a panel surface 207a of a formed
part 207 was 1.5%. A flange 207b was cut off in the same manner as for
the panel parts 31 and 32 and a central portion of the panel surface 107a
was checked for dent resistance by the foregoing method to find that the
dent resistance load was 108N. For obtaining a dent resistance load of
196N by press-stamping a steel sheet of the same strength it was necessary
to set the sheet thickness at 1 mm.</p>
    <p num="0133">Thus, according to the present invention, in comparison with the
conventional press forming method, the dent resistance can be improved to
about 1.8 times using the same sheet blank, and the blank thickness
required for attaining the same dent resistance as in the press forming
method can be decreased, thereby permitting the reduction in weight of the
resulting panel parts.</p>
    <heading>Example 7 :</heading>
    <p num="0134">As shown in FIG. 22A, a square blank 1 having a one-side length of
600 mm and obtained by cutting a cold-rolled steel sheet SPCC (JIS G3141)
having a thickness of 0.8 mm and a tensile strength of 330 MPa, and a
blank 2 of the same material and size as the blank 1, the blank 2 having two
protuberances 2a each formed with a pierced hole 3 of 10 mm in diameter,
the protuberances 2a being each 20 mm in diameter and 3.2 mm in depth,
were put one on the other and laser-welded along a closed curve as shown in
FIG. 10B to fabricate a double sheet blank 5 of bonded blanks.</p>
    <p num="0135">A flange of the double sheet blank 5 was clamped with upper and
lower dies having respectively such upper and lower die cavities 10b, 11b as
shown in FIG. 11 and having a bead 10g and a bead groove 11g throughout
the whole circumference around the upper and lower die cavities, the die
cavities 10b and 11b having a planar size of 400 mm square, a curvature
radius of 3000 mm at respective bottoms 10h and 11h, and a depth of h1 =
h2 = 60 mm, with two recesses 11j formed in the lower die 11, the recesses
11j being shown in FIG. 22B and having a diameter of 20.2 mm and a depth
of 3 mm.</p>
    <p num="0136">An O-ring (JIS B2406) having a nominal No. P16 was used to
provide a seal between the two protuberances 2a and a thru-hole lid having
an inside diameter of 8 mm and the pressure of pressurized medium (water
emulsion) which has been introduced from the thru-hole 11d formed in the
lower die was raised to 9.8 MPa to push up the blank 1 locally into a
channel-forming groove 10d shown in FIG. 22C and having a width w of 13
mm and a depth h of 4 mm, allowing the pressurized medium to enter
between both blanks 1 and 2 and thereby causing both blanks to bulge into
the die cavities 10b and lib.</p>
    <p num="0137">The pressure of the pressurized medium was finally increased to 
39.2 MPa, causing both blanks 1 and 2 to contact the whole areas of the die
cavity bottoms 10h and 11h. At this time, the amount of movement of the
flange 6a toward the die cavities was 3 mm in the vicinity of the pierced
holes 3 and a maximum of 10 mm at the other portion. Thereafter, the
pressure of the pressurized medium was decreased and the formed part 30
shown in FIG. 16A was taken out from the dies, further, the pressurized
medium was discharged from the two pierced holes 3 and the flange of the
formed part 30 was cut off along the trimming line 25c located inside the
bead pattern 25e to afford two panel parts 31 and 32 shown in FIGS. 16B
and 16C.</p>
    <p num="0138">An equivalent strain of panel surfaces 25a and 26a of the panel
parts 31 and 32 was 10% and central portions of the panel surfaces 25a and
26a were checked for dent resistance by the foregoing method to find that
the dent resistance load was 304N.</p>
    <p num="0139">On the other hand, the blank 1 was press-stamped into the same
shape as the panel surfaces 25a and 26a by the method illustrated in FIGS.
8A, 8B, and 8C. An equivalent strain of a panel surface 207a of a formed
part 207 was 1.8%. A flange 207b was cut off in the same manner as for
the panel parts 31 and 32 and a central portion of the panel part 207a was
checked for dent resistance by the foregoing method to find that the dent
resistance load was 147N. Thus, it is seen that according to the present
invention, as compared with the conventional press forming method, the
dent resistance in using the same sheet blanks can be improved to about 2.1
times.</p>
    <p num="0140">In all of the methods described in the above Examples 1 to 7 the
leakage of pressurized medium did not occur during the hydroforming
process and the hydroforming work can be done efficiently to afford desired 
formed products.</p>
    <p num="0141">For bonding two blanks together there may be adopted a method
wherein both blanks are bonded together by laser welding continuously
along a loop-like bonded line, or a method wherein both blanks are surface-bonded
together in respective peripheral areas by adhesion or brazing, or a
method wherein both blanks are bonded together in a discontinuous manner
by spot welding. It is also possible to effect the hydroforming work without
causing leakage of fluid in a merely superimposed state of two blanks
without bonding.</p>
    <p num="0142">Further, by adjusting an equivalent strain of panel surface to a
value falling under an appropriate range it is possible to improve the dent
resistance and reduce the blank thickness required for attaining the same
dent resistance as in the press stamping method, thus proving that the
weight of panel part can be reduced.</p>
    <p num="0143">According to the sheet hydroforming method using the forming die of
the present invention, as set forth above, at the time of stretch-forming two
metallic sheet blanks, pressurized medium can be introduced between the
mating surfaces of the blanks easily without causing leakage of the
pressurized medium. By adjusting an equivalent strain of stretch formed
portion to a value falling under an appropriate range it is possible to
improve the dent resistance and make a contribution to the reduction in
weight of panel part. Thus, the present invention brings about an
outstanding effect industrially.</p>
