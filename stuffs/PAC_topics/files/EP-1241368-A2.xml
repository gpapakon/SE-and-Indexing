  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a sealing
device for rolling bearings.</p>
    <p num="0002">It should be pointed out that the present
invention will make specific reference - without,
however, losing any generality in any way - to a
sealing device for a rolling bearing which is
provided with a encoder wheel which is installed on
an inner race of the rolling bearing itself, and is
mounted on a cylindrical element which presents a
blocking heading, which is arranged under the inner
race and which is suitable for being arranged in
direct contact with a shoulder of a motor shaft or of
a joint.</p>
    <p num="0003">In general, sealing devices of a well-known
type comprise: a substantially rigid support which is
coupled to the inner race of the rolling bearing, a
static sealing lip which extends axially from the
support beyond the blocking heading and which extends
radially towards the inside in order to be compressed
between the blocking heading and the shoulder, and an
additional sealing element which is suitable for
being mounted adjacent to the encoder wheel in order
to protect the encoder wheel itself and in order to 
increase the insulating properties of the inside of
the rolling bearing.</p>
    <p num="0004">Sealing devices of the type described above
present certain disadvantages, among which the
following may be cited: the uncontrolled deformation
of the lip when it is squeezed between the blocking
heading and the shoulder, which causes a reduction in
the sealing capacity of the lip itself; the slight
protection which is afforded to the encoder wheel is
compromised even further by the overall dimensions of
the device; the relatively high number of components,
which makes production costs quite high and which
also complicates the assembly of the devices
themselves.</p>
    <p num="0005">The aim of the present invention is to produce
a sealing device for rolling bearings which will
resolve the above-described disadvantages in a simple
and cost-effective fashion.</p>
    <p num="0006">According to the present invention, a sealing
device for a rolling bearing will be produced
comprising an inner race which is axially blocked by
a blocking element which is suitable for being
arranged in direct contact with a feedback element,
the sealing device comprises a encoder wheel which is
installed on the inner race, a support element, which 
is mounted on the inner race and a static sealing
element which is associated with the support element;
the sealing device is characterised by the fact that
the encoder wheel and the static sealing element are
integral parts of the support element, and the static
sealing element is frontally arranged in relation to
the blocking element and comprises two lips which are
substantially parallel in relation to each other and
which extend opposite the support element, a first
lip of the two lips extends towards the feedback
element and comes into contact with it, and a second
lip of the two lips extends towards a frontal surface
of the inner race and comes into contact with it.</p>
    <p num="0007">The present invention will now be described
with reference to the attached drawings, which show
an axial section, with some parts removed for reasons
of clarity, of a preferred form of embodiment which
is provided as an example of a non-limiting
embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="0008">With reference to the attached drawings, the
number 1 refers to a sealing device for a rolling
bearing 2 in its entirety.</p>
    <p num="0009">It should be pointed out that the rolling
bearing 2 is mounted on a cylindrical shell 3 which
presents a blocking heading 4, which is arranged 
under an inner race 5 of the rolling bearing 2, and
which is suitable for being arranged so that it comes
into contact with a shoulder 6 of a shaft 7 which is
inserted inside the shell 3.</p>
    <p num="0010">The device 1 comprises a encoder wheel 8 which
is installed on the inner race 5, a support element 9
which is mounted on the inner race, and two sealing
elements 10 and 11 which are associated with the
support element 9.</p>
    <p num="0011">The support element 9 comprises two cylindrical
walls 12 and 13, of which the wall 12 is directly
mounted on the inner race 5 and presents an annular
end 14 which extends outside the inner race 5 itself,
while the wall 13 is arranged under the wall 12, and
is connected to the wall 12 itself from the part
opposite that of the annular end 14. The annular end
14 extends in staggered fashion from the inner race 5
and is radially orientated towards the inside and
towards the blocking heading 4 in the gap which
occurs between the inner race 5 itself and the
shoulder 6.</p>
    <p num="0012">Finally, the support element 9 comprises an
annular wall 15, which is connected to the wall 13
and which is arranged in direct contact with the
encoder wheel 8. It should be pointed out that the 
wall 15 and the wall 12, exactly before the annular
end 14, define, in relation to each other, a fixing
housing 16 for the encoder wheel 8, which presents an
internal cylindrical surface 17 which is connected to
the wall 12, and which also presents a lateral
surface 18 which is transverse to the surface 17
itself and which is connected to the wall 18.
Furthermore, the encoder wheel 8 presents another
external cylindrical surface 19 which is
substantially flush arranged with the end part of the
wall 15, and another lateral surface 20, which is
arranged parallel to the surface 18, and which
determines the starting point of the annular end 14
of the wall 12.</p>
    <p num="0013">The sealing element 10 is a static sealing
element, and it is supported by the annular end 14
frontal to the blocking heading 4, in the gap which
occurs between the shoulder 6 and the inner race 5,
in order to be compressed between the shoulder 6
itself and the inner race 5 itself.</p>
    <p num="0014">The element 10 is made of rubber, and it
comprises two lips 21 and 22 which are substantially
parallel in relation to each other, and a connecting
portion 23 between the two lips 21 and 22.</p>
    <p num="0015">It should be pointed out that the lip 21, which 
presents a greater length than the lip 22, extends
from the portion 23 towards the shoulder 6 and comes
into contact with it, and it is radially orientated
opposite the blocking heading 4. On the other hand,
the lip 22 extends from the portion 23 towards a
frontal surface 5s 5a of the inner race 5 and comes
into contact with it, and it is radially orientated
towards the blocking heading4. Finally, the
connecting portion 23 is arranged in direct contact
with the annular end 14, and it is inclined in
relation to each of the lips 21 and 22.</p>
    <p num="0016">The sealing element 10 guarantees a static seal
between the shoulder 6 and the inner race 5, and it
prevents the entry of polluting agents into the gap
which occurs between the sealing element 10 itself
and the inner race 5 itself and also between the wall
12 and the inner race 5. The elastic deformation
which is caused by the compression of the shoulder 6
in relation to the lip 21 determines an expansion in
terms of the circumference of the lip 21 itself, and
an elastic force reaction which, in turn, determines
the adherence of the lip 21 to the shoulder 6 itself.</p>
    <p num="0017">On the other hand, with regard to the staggered
position of the annular end 14, the compression of
the shoulder 6 in relation to the lip 21 determines a 
bending of the annular end 14 itself, with a
consequent compression of the lip 21 when it comes
into contact with the surface 5a.</p>
    <p num="0018">The sealing element 11 is a dynamic sealing
element, and it is arranged between the surface 19 of
the wheel 8 and a cylindrical surface 24, which faces
the surface 19 itself, and which radially limits
towards the inside or, as illustrated, a shield 25 of
a well-known kind of lining 26, or - according to a
variation which is not illustrated - an outer race 27
of the rolling bearing 2. The sealing device 11 is
also made of rubber, and it comprises a cylindrical
wall 28 which is arranged in direct contact with the
surface 19 of the encoder wheel 8 in order to protect
the encoder wheel 8 itself, and it also comprises a
lip 29, which is substantially parallel to the two
lips 21 and 22 and which extends from the free end of
the wall 15 towards the surface 24 and in sliding
contact with it.</p>
    <p num="0019">It is obvious from the above description that
part of the surface 19 and the whole of the surface
20 are directly exposed to atmospheric agents, but it
should be pointed out that, with a view to supplying
adequate protection against such agents, the device 1
comprises a protective shield 30, which is made of 
the same material as the elements 10 and 11, and
which provides a continuous connection between the
elements 10 and 11 themselves.</p>
    <p num="0020">It is clearly obvious, according to the above
description, that the conformation of the sealing
element 10 and the presence of the annular end 14
inside the sealing element 10 itself means that it is
possible to effect a superior kind of control in
relation to the deformation of the two lips 21 and 22
which results in an advantage in terms of the quality
of the static seal of the two lips 21 and 22
themselves. Furthermore, the alternative of having,
in a single component, the two sealing elements 10
and 11 - which are respectively static and dynamicas
well as an encoder wheel 8 and a protective shield
30 which protects the encoder wheel 8 itself results
in the simplification of the assembly of the sealing
device 1 onto the rolling bearing 2, and also results
in the fact that the production of the sealing device
1 itself may be carried out in an extremely cost-effective
fashion.</p>
    <p num="0021">It is not intended that the present invention
be limited to the form of embodiment which has been
herein described and illustrated. The said form of
embodiment is to be taken as a non-limiting example 
of a sealing device 1, which might be subject to
further modifications in relation to the shape and
arrangement of the parts, as well as the details
pertaining to construction and assembly.</p>
