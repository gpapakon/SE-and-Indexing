      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates generally to internal combustion engines
operable for discharging exhaust gas to electrically heated catalysts and, more
particularly, to a method and system for distributing electrical energy from an
integrated starter-alternator during a deceleration or overrun vehicle condition to an
electrically heated catalyst in order to maintain the temperature of the electrically
heated catalyst within an operating temperature range.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0002">For a typical vehicle powered by a sparked ignited internal combustion
engine, two of the most difficult operating conditions for controlling exhaust
emissions are deceleration and overrun. During vehicle deceleration, the engine is
producing very little power and is being partly motored by the vehicle. "Overrun" is
an expression that also describes a deceleration condition, but additionally may
describe a condition where a vehicle is coasting down a sustained downgrade with
the engine being partly motored by the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="0003">Herein, "overrun" will be used to include the deceleration condition. In either
case, the engine load is very light and the percentage of internal exhaust gas recirculation
(EGR) is high. Both of these factors contribute to marginal combustion
stability. This results in high engine out hydrocarbon (HC) emissions and cool
exhaust gas temperatures. The low exhaust gas temperatures are particularly a
problem for the catalyst which are often not hot enough to keep the catalyst active.
The engine calibrator is faced with either of two options each of which has its own
drawbacks.</p>
    <p num="0004">The first option is to leave the fuel injection enabled during the overrun. In
this case the cool exhaust temperature will cool the catalyst causing it to become
inefficient or even inactive. This allows hydrocarbons to accumulate in the catalyst
or exit the tailpipe untreated. This problem is exacerbated by combustion stability
being marginal under this condition. Hence, the engine out HC emissions tend to be
exceptionally high. Once the engine comes back under load after a sustained
overrun condition, the catalyst must be heated by the hot exhaust gas for the catalyst 
to become active and efficient again. Until that happens, untreated hydrocarbons
will leave the tailpipe. In addition, the unburned hydrocarbons which accumulated in
the catalyst during the overrun can create a run away thermal reaction once the
engine comes under load again. This can either shorten the life of the catalyst or
destroy the catalyst.</p>
    <p num="0005">Another compromise with this option is that spark advance is typically
retarded during an overrun condition. This is an attempt to keep the catalyst hot by
initiating combustion late thereby increasing exhaust gas temperature. However,
this compromises combustion efficiency and increases fuel consumption.</p>
    <p num="0006">The second option is to disable the fuel injection during the overrun condition.
This prevents unburned hydrocarbons from accumulating in the catalyst. However,
the engine is now being motored completely by the vehicle and pumps cool ambient
air through the catalyst which cools the catalyst. When the vehicle comes off of the
overrun condition and the fuel injection is enabled again, the catalyst temperature
may be close to ambient and will have to be reheated a great amount before
becoming active again. During this time interval when the catalyst is warming up
large amounts of untreated hydrocarbons may escape out of the tailpipe.</p>
    <p num="0007">Accordingly, what is needed is a method and system operable with an
electrically heated catalyst for addressing problems which occur in achieving low
exhaust emissions and low fuel consumption when a vehicle goes into a sustained
deceleration or overrun operating condition.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a method and system for
distributing electrical energy from an integrated starter-alternator during a
deceleration or overrun vehicle condition to an electrically heated catalyst in order to
maintain the temperature of the electrically heated catalyst within an operating
temperature range.</p>
    <p num="0009">In accordance with the object and other objects, the present invention
provides an exhaust system for a motor vehicle having an internal combustion
engine. The exhaust system includes an electrically heated catalyst operable for
cleaning exhaust gas discharged by the internal combustion engine when the
temperature of the electrically heated catalyst is in an operating temperature range.
The exhaust system further includes a catalyst heater which converts electrical 
energy into heat. An integral starter-alternator converts mechanical energy
generated by the internal combustion engine into electrical energy. The electrical
energy from the integral starter-alternator is supplied to the catalyst heater during
vehicle overrun. The catalyst heater uses the electrical energy to heat the
electrically heated catalyst in order to maintain the temperature of the electrically
heated catalyst in the operating temperature range during vehicle overrun.</p>
    <p num="0010">Further, in accordance with the object and other objects, the present invention
also provides a method for cleaning exhaust gas generated by an internal
combustion engine of a motor vehicle during vehicle overrun. The method includes
cleaning exhaust gas discharged by the internal combustion engine with an
electrically heated catalyst when the temperature of the electrically heated catalyst is
in an operating temperature range. An integral starter-alternator is then used to
convert mechanical energy generated by the internal combustion engine and kinetic
energy of motion of the vehicle into electrical energy. The electrical energy from the
integral starter-alternator is then converted into heat by the electrically heated
catalyst in order to maintain the temperature of the electrically heated catalyst in the
operating temperature range during vehicle overrun.</p>
    <p num="0011">There are numerous advantages associated with the present invention. As
well as contributing a minor amount of braking action, the present invention helps the
catalyst maintain its temperature and remain active and efficient. This eliminates the
need to consider the second option described above where fuel is disabled during
the overrun with its associated emission penalties. The present invention also
eliminates the drawbacks associated with the first option because electrical heating
of the catalyst during an overrun condition allows the catalyst to remain active and
efficient.</p>

      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0012">The Figure illustrates a block diagram of a system for distributing electrical
energy from an integrated starter-alternator during a deceleration or overrun vehicle
condition to an electrically heated catalyst in accordance with the method of the
present invention.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0013">Referring now to the Figure, a block diagram of a system 10 for distributing
electrical energy from an integrated starter-alternator during a motor vehicle 
deceleration or overrun condition to an electrically heated catalyst in accordance with
the method of the present invention is shown. In general, the integrated starter-alternator
distributes electrical energy to the electrically heated catalyst during
vehicle deceleration or overrun in order to maintain the temperature of the electrically
heated catalyst within an operating temperature range during the vehicle
deceleration or overrun.</p>
    <p num="0014">System 10 is incorporated into a vehicle having an internal combustion engine
12. Generally, engine 12 intakes an air/fuel mixture into a combustion cylinder,
ignites the air/fuel mixture with a spark plug to produce combustion, and then passes
exhaust gas resulting from the combustion into an exhaust manifold 14. Exhaust
manifold 14 then passes the exhaust gas to a catalytic converter 16.</p>
    <p num="0015">Catalytic converter 16 cleans the exhaust gas and passes the cleaned
exhaust gas to a tailpipe 20 for discharge. Catalytic converter 16 includes an
electrically heated catalyst 18. Electrically heated catalyst 18 carries an oxidizing
catalyst for cleaning the exhaust gas. Electrically heated catalyst 18 could also be a
three way catalyst. In order to operate properly, catalytic converter 16 and
electrically heated catalyst 22 need to be maintained at a sufficient operating
temperature such as at least 600°C. During normal vehicle operation, the
temperature of the exhaust gas is hot enough to maintain the operating temperatures
of catalytic converter 16 and electrically heated catalyst 18.</p>
    <p num="0016">However, during certain operating conditions such as start up of engine 12
and vehicle deceleration and overrun, the temperature of the exhaust gas is not hot
enough to heat catalytic converter 16 and electrically heated catalyst 18 for these
devices to function properly. To this end, electrically heated catalyst 18 is
associated with an electrical catalyst heater 22. Catalyst heater 22 generates heat
in response to receiving electrical energy. Catalyst heater 22 provides the heat to
electrically heated catalyst 18 in order to activate the oxidizing catalyst and promote
the removal of hydrocarbons. Electrically heated catalyst 18 is activated when its
temperature is maintained within the operating temperature range.</p>
    <p num="0017">A temperature sensor 24 measures the temperature of electrically heated
catalyst 18. Temperature sensor 24 may be a device that directly measures the
temperature of electrically heated catalyst 18 or may infer this temperature from
other parameters. In any event, temperature sensor 24 generates a temperature
signal indicative of the temperature of electrically heated catalyst 18. </p>
    <p num="0018">System 10 further includes an energy storage device 26 such as a battery
and/or capacitors for supplying electrical energy to operate system 10. Battery 26
provides electrical energy to an integral starter-alternator (ISA) inverter controller 28.
ISA inverter controller 28 supplies electrical power from battery 26 to an engine
control module (ECM) 30 for powering the ECM. ECM 30 is operable with engine 12
to control the engine in response to various sensor inputs. Such control may include
controlling the air/fuel mixture injected into the engine cylinders, the timing of the
air/fuel injection, and the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves of the
engine cylinders, and other engine functions.</p>
    <p num="0019">ISA inverter controller 28 also supplies electrical power from battery 26 to an
integrated starter-alternator (ISA) 32. ISA 32 is an electromagnetic device that uses
the electrical power from battery 26 to turn over or start engine 12. ISA 32 also
converts the mechanical energy supplied by engine 12 while running into electrical
energy. ISA 32 transfers the converted electrical energy back to ISA controller 28.
ISA inverter controller 28 may then transfer the converted electrical energy to battery
26 to recharge the battery. As will be explained in detail below, ISA inverter
controller 28 transfers converted electrical energy to catalyst heater 22. During the
process of ISA inverter controller 28 transferring the converted electrical energy to
catalyst heater 22, ISA 32 accomplishes some braking affect on the vehicle.</p>
    <p num="0020">During normal operation of the vehicle, the heat of exhaust gas from engine
12 maintains the temperature of electrically heated catalyst 18 within its normal
operating range. A problem with maintaining the temperature of electrically heated
catalyst 18 occurs when the vehicle goes into a sustained deceleration or overrun
operating condition. In either of these conditions the temperature of the exhaust gas
cools down to a temperature which is often not sufficient to heat electrically heated
catalyst 18 for the electrically heated catalyst to function properly. In accordance
with the method and system of the present invention, ISA controller 28 provides
controlled electrical power from ISA 32 to catalyst heater 22 in order to heat
electrically heated catalyst 18 during a deceleration or overrun condition of the
vehicle, i.e., "overrun". Upon initiation of vehicle overrun, ISA inverter controller 28
first attempts to use electrical energy from ISA 32 to charge battery 26 and the
system capacitors to adequate levels before supplying electrical energy to
electrically heated catalyst 18. At the beginning of an overrun, electrically heated
catalyst 18 has not had time to cool yet so heating is not initially necessary. </p>
    <p num="0021">ISA inverter controller 28 then makes a determination as to when electrically
heated catalyst 18 has cooled in temperature to where its conversion efficiency is
unsatisfactory. ISA inverter controller 28 makes this determination by comparing the
temperature signal generated from temperature sensor 24 with a predetermined
operating temperature range for electrically heated catalyst 18. ISA inverter
controller 28 may also make this determination by inferring the temperature of
electrically heated catalyst 18 indirectly based on other available parameters such as
suitable parameters obtained from ECM 30.</p>
    <p num="0022">Once ISA inverter controller 28 determines that heating of electrically heated
catalyst 18 is required, the ISA inverter controller provides catalyst heater 22 with
controlled electrical power from ISA 32. In turn, catalyst heater 22 uses the
controlled electrical power from ISA 32 to heat up electrically heated catalyst 18 in
order for the electrically heated catalyst to function properly. At the end of the
vehicle overrun condition and engine 12 has come under load again, ISA inverter
controller 28 determines when the exhaust gas has enough heat to heat electrically
heated catalyst 18. Upon determining that the exhaust gas has enough heat, ISA
inverter controller 28 deactivates catalyst heater 22 from receiving electrical power
from ISA 32. Another option is to use ECM 30 to sense the temperature of
electrically heated catalyst 18 and control electrical power to catalyst heater 22.</p>
    <p num="0023">The following are typical wattage ratings based on the inventors experience
with system 10: catalyst heater 22 has a 1.6 kW rating, ISA 32 has a 6 to 20 kW
(peak) rating, and the vehicle braking power dissipation can be on the order of 200
kW for two seconds during a 60 mph to 0 mph deceleration stop. From these
values, a couple of inferences can be made. First, ISA 32 can be made with
adequate power generating capacity to power catalyst heater 22. Second, energy
dissipated by catalyst heater 22 makes only a minor contribution to the vehicle's
braking. Thus, the effect of system 10 on braking dynamics is small.</p>
    <p num="0024">In summary, the advantages associated with the present invention are that
untreated hydrocarbons will not exit tailpipe 10 during an overrun condition due to
electrical heated catalyst 18 becoming inefficient or inactive due to cool catalyst
temperature. Untreated hydrocarbons will not accumulate in electrical heated
catalyst 18 during an overrun condition with its associated risk of shortening catalyst
life or destruction of the catalyst. Once the vehicle comes off of the overrun
condition and comes under load again, electrically heated catalyst is immediately 
active and efficient. Thus, there will be no hydrocarbon emission spike as untreated
hydrocarbons exit the tailpipe while the catalyst is being warmed back up by the
exhaust gas.</p>
    <p num="0025">The present invention does not require spark advance to be retarded as much
during an overrun condition with its associated loss in combustion efficiency and
increased fuel consumption. The present invention provides a convenient way to
dissipate power generated by integral starter-alternator (ISA) 32 when it is being
used to assist in vehicle braking and energy storage 26 (battery and capacitors) is
fully charged and cannot accept all of the additional energy.</p>
    <p num="0026">Thus it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the
present invention, a method and system for distributing electrical energy from an
integrated starter-alternator during a deceleration or overrun condition to an
electrically heated catalyst in order to maintain the temperature of the electrically
heated catalyst within an operating temperature range. While embodiments of the
present invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these
embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the
words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it
is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit
and scope of the invention.</p>
