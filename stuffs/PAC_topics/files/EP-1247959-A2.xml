      <u style="single">1. Field of Invention</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates in general to reciprocating
internal combustion engines of a variable compression ratio type
that is capable of varying a compression ratio under operation
thereof and more particularly to the reciprocating internal
combustion engines of a multi-link type wherein each piston is
connected to a crankshaft through a plurality of links. More
specifically, the present invention is concerned with a piston
control mechanism of such internal combustion engines.</p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">2. Description of Related Art</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0002">In the field of reciprocating internal combustion engines,
there has been proposed a variable compression ratio type that is
capable of varying a compression ratio of the engine in
accordance with operation condition of the same. One of such
engines is shown in Laid-Open Japanese Patent Application
(Tokkai) 2000-73804. The engine of the publication employs a
piston control mechanism wherein each piston is connected to a
crankshaft through a plurality of links.</p>
    <p num="0003">For ease of understanding of the present invention, the
piston control mechanism of the publication will be briefly
described with reference to Fig. 12 of the accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="0004">In the drawing, denoted by numeral 101 is a crankshaft
having crank pins 102. To each crank pin 102, there is pivotally
connected a lower link (floating lever) 103 at a middle portion
thereof. To one end of lower link 103, there is pivotally
connected a lower end of an upper link 106 through a first
connecting pin 110. An upper end of the upper link 106 is
pivotally connected to a piston 104 through a piston pin 105. To
the other end of lower link 103, there is pivotally connected a
lower end of a control link 107 through a second connecting pin 
111. An upper end of control link 107 is pivotally connected to
an eccentric pin 109 of a control crankshaft 108. More
specifically, the lower and upper ends of control link 107 are
formed with respective cylindrical bearing bores which pivotally
receive second connecting pin 111 and eccentric pin 109
respectively. Under operation of the engine, control crankshaft
108 is turned in accordance with operation condition of the
engine, causing control link 107 to vary and set pivoting
movement of lower link 103 thereby varying or setting a stroke of
the piston 104. With this operation, the compression ratio of the
engine is varied in accordance with the engine operation
condition.</p>
    <heading>
      <u style="single">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p num="0005">In the piston control mechanism as mentioned hereinabove,
based on both an upward inertial load applied to piston 104 when
piston 104 moves upward and a downward load applied to the
same when combustion takes place, a certain load is inevitably
applied to control link 107 through upper link 106 and lower link
103. In control links like the control link 107 of which both ends
are formed with cylindrical bearing bores, it is known that an
elastic deformation appearing on control link 107 when a tensile
load is applied thereto is greater than that appearing when a
compression load is applied thereto. That is, variation of effective
length of control link 107 in case of receiving the tensile load is
larger than that in case of receiving the compression load. That
is, in case of the compression load, only a shaft portion proper of
control link 107 defined between the two cylindrical bearing bores
is subjected to an elastic deformation, while, in case of tensile
load, the entire length of control link 107 including the two
thinner cylindrical bearing bores is subjected to the elastic
deformation inducing the increase in elastic deformation degree.</p>
    <p num="0006">When piston 104 comes up to a top dead center (TDC) on
exhaust stroke, upward inertial load of piston 104 brings the
crown of the same into a position closest to intake and exhaust
valves. Furthermore, when, due to valve overlapping or the like, 
intake and exhaust valves are still open partially at such top dead
center (TDC), the piston crown becomes much closer to the
intake and exhaust valves. Thus, when, with piston 104 taking
the top dead center (TDC) on exhaust stroke, a certain tensile
load is applied to control link 107 based on the upward inertial
load of piston 104, the elastic deformation of control link 107
becomes remarkable causing piston 104 to be displaced from a
proper position, which tends to deteriorate engine performance.
Furthermore, if the displacement of piston 104 becomes
remarkably large, undesirable interference between piston 104
and intake and exhaust valves may occur.</p>
    <p num="0007">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide
a piston control mechanism of reciprocating internal combustion
engine, which is free of the above-mentioned undesired piston
displacement.</p>
    <p num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to provide a
piston control mechanism of reciprocating internal combustion
engine of variable compression ratio type, which can assuredly
avoid interference between a piston and intake and exhaust
valves without sacrificing engine performance, that is, without
narrowing a range in which the engine compression ratio is
variable.</p>
    <p num="0009">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a
piston control mechanism of reciprocating internal combustion
engine of variable compression ratio type, which is compact in
size and exhibits a high cost performance.</p>
    <p num="0010">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a piston control mechanism of an internal combustion
engine, the engine including a piston slidably disposed in a piston
cylinder and a crankshaft converting a reciprocation movement of
the piston to a rotation movement, the piston control mechanism
comprising a lower link rotatably disposed on a crank pin of the
crankshaft; an upper link having one end pivotally connected to
the lower link and the other end pivotally connected to the 
piston; a control link having one end pivotally connected to the
lower link; and a position changing mechanism which changes a
supporting axis about which the other end of the control link
turns, wherein when the piston comes up to a top dead center, a
compression load is applied to the control link in an axial direction
of the control link in accordance with an upward inertial load of
the piston.</p>
    <p num="0011">According to a second aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a piston control mechanism of an internal
combustion engine, the engine including a piston slidably
disposed in a piston cylinder and a crankshaft converting a
reciprocation movement of the piston to a rotation movement,
the piston control mechanism comprising a lower link rotatably
disposed on a crank pin of the crankshaft; an upper link having
one end pivotally connected to the lower link and the other end
pivotally connected to the piston; a control link having one end
pivotally connected to the lower link; and a position changing
mechanism including a control crankshaft which extends in
parallel with the crankshaft and rotates about a given axis, the
control crankshaft including a main shaft portion which is
rotatable about the given axis and an eccentric pin which is
radially raised from the main shaft portion, the eccentric pin
being received in a cylindrical bearing bore formed in the other
end of the control link, wherein when the piston comes up to a
top dead center, a rotation direction of an upper link center line
relative to a first direction line is equal to a rotation direction of a
control link center line relative to a second direction line, the
upper link center line being an imaginary line which
perpendicularly crosses both a first pivot axis between the piston
and the upper link and a second pivot axis between the upper link
and the lower link, the control link center line being an imaginary
line which perpendicularly crosses both a third pivot axis between
the lower link and the control link and the supporting axis, the 
first direction line being an imaginary line which perpendicularly
crosses both the second pivot axis and a center axis of the crank
pin, and the second direction line being an imaginary line which
perpendicularly crosses both the third pivot axis and the center
axis of the crank pin.</p>

    </heading>
    <p num="0013">In the following, various embodiments of the present
invention will be described in detail with reference to the
accompanying drawings.</p>
    <p num="0014">For ease of understanding, various directional terms, such
as, right, left, upper, lower, rightward, etc., are contained in the
description. However, such terms are to be understood with
respect to only drawing or drawings on which corresponding part
or portion is illustrated.</p>
    <p num="0015">Furthermore, for simplification of description, throughout
the description, substantially same parts and constructions are
denoted by the same numerals and repeated explanation of them
will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="0016">Referring to Figs. 1 to 9A and 9B, particularly Figs. 1 and 2,
there is shown a piston control mechanism of a first embodiment
of the present invention, which is applied to a reciprocating
internal combustion engine of variable compression ratio type.</p>
    <p num="0017">As is seen from Fig. 1, the piston control mechanism 100A
of the first embodiment comprises a lower link 11 which is
rotatably disposed on a crank pin 2 of a crankshaft 1 of an
associated internal combustion engine at a center opening
thereof. A center axis of crank pin 2 is denoted by reference P6.
The lower link 11 is shaped generally triangle. An upper link 13
is pivotally connected at a lower end to lower link 11 through a
first connecting pin 12 and pivotally connected at an upper end to
a piston 3 through a piston pin 4. A center axis of first
connecting pin 12 is denoted by reference P2 and a center axis of 
piston pin 4 is denoted by reference P1. A control link 15 is
pivotally connected at an upper end to lower link 11 through a
second connecting pin 14 and pivotally connected at a lower end
to a body of the engine trough a position changing mechanism 16.
A center axis of second connecting pin 14 is denoted by reference
P3. As will be described in detail hereinafter, position changing
mechanism 16 is constructed to change a supporting axis P4
about which the lower end of control link 15 turns. Thus, the
degree of freedom of lower link 11 is controlled.</p>

defined in a cylinder block 5. A piston head 3a of piston 3 is
formed with a recess that constitutes part of a combustion
chamber.</p>
    <p num="0019">The position changing mechanism 16 comprises a control
crankshaft 17 which substantially extends in parallel with
crankshaft 1 and an electric actuator which rotates control
crankshaft 17 about its center axis P5 in accordance with an
operation condition of the engine.</p>
    <p num="0020">As is seen from Figs. 6A and 6B, control crankshaft 17
comprises a main shaft portion 18 which rotates about the center
axis P5, paired crank arms 20 which extend radially outward from
the main shaft portion 18 and an eccentric pin 19 which is held
between the paired crank arms 20 at a position eccentric to main
shaft portion 18. Eccentric pin 19 is of a cylindrical solid member
of which center axis P4 is the supporting axis P4 of control link 15.
The cylindrical eccentric pin 19 is received in a cylindrical bearing
bore 23 formed in a lower end of control link 15. (It is to be
noted that Figs. 6A and 6B (and Figs. 7A to 8B) are
exaggeratedly illustrated.) Control link 15 is formed at an upper
end with a cylindrical bearing bore 21 which rotatably receives
second connecting pin 14.</p>
    <p num="0021">As is seen from Fig. 6B, the center axis P4 of the eccentric
pin 19 (viz., supporting axis P4 of control link 15) is eccentric to
the center axis P5 of main shaft portion 18 of control crankshaft
17. </p>
    <p num="0022">For achieving easy mounting onto crank pin 2 and eccentric
pin 19, lower link 11 and control link 15 are constructed to have a
split structure.</p>
    <p num="0023">When, in operation, control crankshaft 17 (see Fig. 1) is
turned by the electric actuator about its center axis P5 in
accordance with the engine operation condition, the lower end of
control link 15 is subjected to position change and thus behavior
of lower link 11 changes thereby to change the stroke of piston 3,
resulting in that the compression ratio of the engine is varied.</p>
    <p num="0024">Figs. 3A, 3B and 3C schematically show variation of elastic
deformation of control link 15 that appears when a load is applied
thereto in different directions. These drawings respectively show
a compressed condition wherein control link 15 is applied with a
compression load, a neutral condition wherein control link 15 has
no load applied thereto and an extended condition wherein
control link 15 is applied with a tensile load. For ease of
understanding, control link 15 and deformation of the same are
illustrated exaggeratingly.</p>
    <p num="0025">As is seen from these drawings, control link 15 is formed at
an upper boss portion (viz., first boss portion) 22 with the
cylindrical bearing bore 21 through which second connecting pin
14 passes, and at a lower boss portion (viz., second boss portion)
24 with the cylindrical bearing bore 23 through which eccentric
pin 19 passes.</p>
    <p num="0026">If the distance between respective axes of pins 14 and 19
that pass through bores 21 and 23 of control link 15 is assumed
as an effective length of control link 15, the effective length has
the following tendency that depends on a direction in which a
load is applied to control link 15.</p>
    <p num="0027">That is, as is seen from the drawings, a difference between
effective length D3 of link 15 in the extended condition and
effective length D1 of link 15 in neutral condition is greater than
that between effective length D2 of link 15 in the compressed
condition and effective length D1 of link in neutral condition.</p>
    <p num="0028">The reasons of this phenomenon may be as follows. </p>
    <p num="0029">That is, in case of applying a compression load to control
link 15 (viz., Fig. 3A), only a main shaft portion 25 of link 15 is
compressed leaving upper and lower boss portions 22 and 24 not
compressed. While, in case of applying a tensile load to control
link 15 (viz., Fig. 3C), not only main shaft portion 25 but also
upper and lower boss portions 22 and 24 of link 15 are extended
axially outward, and thus, the above-mentioned phenomenon
takes place.</p>
    <p num="0030">As is known, when, under operation of the engine, piston 3
comes up to a top dead center (TDC) particularly on exhaust
stroke, a remarked upward inertia load F1 (see Fig. 1) is applied
to piston 3. This inertia load tends to bring piston 3 to a position
closest to the intake and exhaust valves. Accordingly, when, due
to valve overlapping or the like, the intake and exhaust valve are
still open partially at such top dead center (TDC), piston 3
becomes much closer to the intake and exhaust valves increasing
a possibility of undesirable contact of piston crown with the intake
and exhaust valves.</p>
    <p num="0031">In order to assuredly avoid such undesired contact, the
following measures are practically employed in the first
embodiment 100A of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="0032">That is, as is seen from Fig. 1, at the time when piston 3
comes up to the top dead center (TDC), a downward load F2
applied to control link 15 caused by an upward inertial load F1 of
piston 3 through upper link 13 and lower link 11 is adjusted to
operate in a direction coincident with an imaginary line that
extends through both center axis P3 of second connecting pin 14
and supporting axis P4 of control link 15 (viz., center axis P4 of
eccentric pin 19. That is, piston control mechanism 100A of the
first embodiment is so arranged that upon piston 3 reaching the
top dead center (TDC), control link 15 is just applied with the
compression load.</p>
    <p num="0033">The measures of the first embodiment 100A will be much
clearly understood from the following description. </p>
    <p num="0034">Let us call an imaginary line perpendicularly crossing both
center axis P1 of piston pin 4 and center axis P2 of first
connecting pin 12 as an upper link center line 13A, an imaginary
line perpendicularly crossing both center axis P3 of second
connecting pin 14 and supporting axis P4 of control link 15 (viz.,
center axis P4 of eccentric pin 19) as a control link center line
15A, an imaginary line perpendicularly crossing both center axis
P2 of first connecting pin 12 and center axis P6 of crank pin 2 as
a first direction line H1 and an imaginary line perpendicularly
crossing both center axis P3 of second connecting pin 14 and
center axis P6 of crank pin 2 as a second direction line H2. As
shown, in the first embodiment 100A, when piston 3 is at the top
dead center (TDC), a rotation direction α1 of upper link center
line 13A relative to first direction line H1 is equal to a rotation
direction α2 of control link center line 15A relative to second
direction line H2.</p>
    <p num="0035">When an upward load F3 is applied to lower link 11 along
upper link center line 13A from upper link 13 based on upward
inertial load F1, lower link 11 is applied with a torque about
center axis P6 of crank pin 2 in the same direction as direction α1.
Since direction α2 is set equal to direction α1, a load applied to
control link 15 according to the torque functions to compress
control link 15, that is, to apply control link 15 with a
compression load. It is to be noted that if the rotation direction
of control link center line 15A relative to second direction line H2
is opposite to the above-mentioned direction α1, the load would
function to extend control link 15, that is, to apply control link 15
with a tensile load, which is not preferable.</p>
    <p num="0036">As is understood from the above description, in the first
embodiment 100A, when piston 3 comes up to the top dead
center (TDC), control link 15 is applied with a compression load
and thus, the elastic deformation of control link 15 is considerably
reduced. This is very advantageous when piston comes up to the
top dead center (TDC) on exhaust stroke. Accordingly, the
above-mentioned undesirable upward displacement of piston 3 at 
the top dead center on exhaust stroke is suppressed, and thus,
the possibility of undesirable contact of piston crown 3a with the
intake and exhaust valves is suppressed. With this advantageous
operation, there is no need of narrowing a range in which the
engine compression ratio is varied, and thus, engine performance
can be improved.</p>
    <p num="0037">When now piston 3 is at the top dead center (TDC) on
compression stroke wherein a downward load is applied to piston
3 due to the fuel combustion in combustion chamber, the load
applied to the control link 15 functions to extend the same, that
is, to apply the same with a tensile load. Thus, the elastic
deformation of control link 15 becomes relatively large. However,
since, in the compression stroke, both the intake and exhaust
valves are kept closed and the load applied to piston 3 is directed
downward, there is no possibility of contact of piston crown 3a
with the intake and exhaust valves. Furthermore, lowering of
thermal efficiency of the engine caused by such elastic
deformation of control link 15 at the top dead center (TDC) on
compression stroke is relatively small. That is, the deformation
of control link 15 is not just a deformation but an elastic
deformation that has an elastic energy as a potential energy. It
is thought that, under operation of engine, part of energy
produced as a result of fuel combustion in combustion chamber is
stored in the engine body as the elastic energy, and when piston
3 comes down while reducing the load, the stored energy is used
for assisting rotation of crankshaft 1.</p>
    <p num="0038">In the following, elastic deformation of control crankshaft
17 will be described with reference to Figs. 5 to 9B. It is to be
noted that parts shown in these drawings are illustrated
exaggeratingly for ease of understanding.</p>
    <p num="0039">As is seen from Fig. 6A, in control crankshaft 17, center
axis P4 of eccentric pin 19 to which lower end of control link 15 is
pivotally connected is eccentric to center axis P5 of main shaft
portion 18 of control crankshaft 17. Thus, under operation of
engine, a certain bending moment is applied to control crankshaft 
17 from control link 15. A bending deformation of control
crankshaft 17 caused by such bending moment varies in
accordance with a direction in which the load is applied to
eccentric pin 19.</p>
    <p num="0040">That is, as is seen from Figs. 6A and 6B, in case wherein
the load is directed from center axis P5 of main shaft portion 18
of control crankshaft 17 to center axis P4 of eccentric pin 19 of
control crankshaft 17, the bending deformation of control
crankshaft 17 exhibits the smallest value as is indicated by the
characteristic line L-1 of graph of Fig. 5. While, as is seen from
Figs. 7A and 7B, in case wherein the load is directed from center
axis P4 of eccentric pin 19 to center axis P5 of main shaft portion
18, the bending deformation of control crankshaft 17 exhibits the
greatest value as is indicated by the characteristic line L-2 of Fig.
5. While, as is seen from Figs. 8A and 8B, in case wherein the
load is directed perpendicular to a third direction line H3 which
perpendicularly extends across both center axis P5 of main shaft
portion 18 and center axis P4 of eccentric pin 19, the bending
deformation of control crankshaft 17 exhibits an intermediate
value as is indicated by the characteristic line L-3 of Fig. 5.</p>
    <p num="0041">The reason of this phenomenon will be described in the
following with reference t Figs. 9A and 9B.</p>
    <p num="0042">In case wherein as shown in Fig. 9A the load is directed
from center axis P4 of eccentric pin 19 to center axis P5 of main
shaft portion 18, eccentric pin 19 is applied at axial edges 26 of a
radially inside part thereof with a tensile load and thus the
bending deformation of control crankshaft 17 is large. Actually,
control crankshaft 17 exhibits a lower rigidity at eccentric pin 19.
While, in case wherein as shown in Fig. 9B the load is directed
from center axis P5 of main shaft portion 18 to center axis P4 of
eccentric pin 19, eccentric pin 19 is applied at axial edges 26 of
the radially inside part thereof with a compression load and thus
the bending deformation of control crankshaft 17 is small.</p>
    <p num="0043">The bending deformation of control crankshaft 17 directly
causes the undesired displacement of piston 3 from a proper 
position. Thus, when the bending deformation of control
crankshaft 17 is large, piston 3 shows a marked displacement at
the top dead center (TDC) on exhaust stroke, which tends to
increase the possibility of inducting the undesired contact of
piston crown 3a with the intake and exhaust valves. Since, in a
higher compression ratio condition as shown in Fig. 1, the top
dead center (TDC) of piston 3 is positioned higher than that in a
lower compression ratio condition as shown in Fig. 2, such
undesired possibility is increased.</p>
    <p num="0044">In view of this, in the piston control mechanism of the first
embodiment 100A, there is employed such a measure that in the
higher compression ratio condition the bending deformation of
control crankshaft 17 at the top dead center (TDC) of piston 3 is
made smaller than that in the lower compression ratio condition.
More specifically, the bending deformation of control crankshaft
17 at the top dead center of piston 3 is gradually reduced as the
compression ratio set is increased.</p>
    <p num="0045">That is, as will be understood when comparing the drawings
of Figs. 1 and 2, a so-called eccentric angle H defined between
third direction line H3 (see Fig. 8B) and control link center line
15A at the top dead center of piston 3 in the higher compression
ratio condition (Fig. 1) is set smaller than an eccentric angle L
defined in the lower compression ratio condition (Fig. 2).</p>
    <p num="0046">Accordingly, when, under the higher compression ratio
condition, piston 3 comes up to the top dead center (TDC), the
bending deformation of control crankshaft 17 is sufficiently
restrained thereby suppressing or at least minimizing undesired
upward displacement of piston 3 from its proper position (viz.,
regulated top dead center). Thus, undesired contact of piston
crown 3a with the intake and exhaust valves is assuredly
prevented. This means permission of enlargement of the range
in which the engine compression ratio can be varied.</p>
    <p num="0047">Furthermore, as is seen from Figs. 1 and 2, in the first
embodiment 100A, when piston 3 is at the top dead center,
center axis P2 of first connecting pin 12 and center axis P3 of 
second connecting pin 14 are positioned at opposite sides with
respect to an imaginary plane B that includes center axis P6 of
crank pin 2 of crankshaft 1 and is parallel with an axis of a piston
cylinder 6 of the engine, and supporting axis P4 of control link 15
is positioned below center axis P3 of second connecting pin 14.</p>
    <p num="0048">Accordingly, control crankshaft 17 whose eccentric pin 19
passes through the lower end of control crankshaft 15 can be
located in an obliquely lower zone of crankshaft 1 in cylinder
block 5, which usually offers a larger space. Thus, control
crankshaft 17 and its associated parts can be compactly and
readily installed in cylinder block 5 without changing the shape of
the same.</p>
    <p num="0049">Referring to Fig. 10, there is shown a piston control
mechanism 100B of a second embodiment of the present
invention.</p>
    <p num="0050">In this embodiment 100B, when piston 3 is at the top dead
center (TDC), center axis P2 of first connecting pin 12 and center
axis P3 of second connecting pin 14 are positioned at the same
side with respect to the imaginary plane B that includes center
axis P6 of crank pin 2 of crankshaft 1 and is parallel with the axis
of cylinder 6 of the engine, and supporting axis P4 of control link
15 is positioned above center axis P3 of second connecting pin 14.
That is, control link 15 extends diagonally upward from lower link
11, which causes positioning of control crankshaft 17 above
crankshaft 1. Thus, as compared with the above-mentioned first
embodiment 100A, the second embodiment 100B is somewhat
poor in layout.</p>
    <p num="0051">However, also in the second embodiment 100B, when
piston 3 is at the top dead center (TDC), a rotation direction β1 of
upper link center line 13A relative to first direction line H1 is
equal to a rotation direction β2 of control link center line 15A
relative to second direction line H2. Accordingly, when piston 3
comes up to dead top center on exhaust stroke, a load F2 applied
to control link 15 functions to compress the same and thus
bending deformation of control crankshaft 17 is minimized 
thereby suppressing or at least minimizing undesired upward
displacement of piston 3 at the top dead center. Thus, possibility
of undesirable contact of piston crown 3a with the intake and
exhaust valves is suppressed.</p>
    <p num="0052">Referring to Fig. 11, there is shown a piston control
mechanism 100C of a third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
    <p num="0053">In this third embodiment 100C, when, under a higher
compression ratio condition, piston 3 comes up to the top dead
center on exhaust stroke, the eccentric angle H defined between
third direction line H3 (see Fig. 8B) and control link center line
15A is set 0 (zero) degree. Accordingly, in this third embodiment
100C, under the condition wherein piston crown 3a comes to a
position closes to the intake and exhaust valves, the bending
deformation of control crankshaft 17 is most effectively
suppressed and thus the possibility of contact of piston crown 3a
with the intake and exhaust valves is assuredly suppressed.</p>
