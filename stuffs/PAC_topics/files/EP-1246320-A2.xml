    <heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a wideband optical
fiber amplifier having an amplification bandwidth at 1480-1520
nm which is a low loss region of an optical fiber.</p>
    <heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
    <p num="0002">In conjunction with the spread of the Internet, etc.,
the communication capacity has been increasing rapidly so
that the use of a communication system in the WDM
(Wavelength Division Multiplexing) scheme as a large
capacity optical communication system is becoming popular.
In this WDM system, it is indispensable to use an EDFA
(Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier) as a repeater, and the WDM
system with the EDFA having an amplification bandwidth of
1.53-1.60 µm has been available.</p>
    <p num="0003">However, in order to realize a larger capacity for the
communication facility, there is a need to enlarge the
amplification bandwidth of the optical fiber amplifier, and
there are great demands for a development of an optical
fiber amplifier capable of covering a low loss region
(1.45-1.65 µm) of a silica fiber.</p>
    <p num="0004">To this end, an optical fiber amplifier adapted to an
S-band (1480-1520 nm) in which the silica fiber has low
loss and low dispersion equivalent to the already available
C-band (1530-1560 nm) has been developed. There are
currently three types of such an optical fiber amplifier in
the S-band.</p>
    <p num="0005">The first one is a Raman optical fiber amplifier that
utilizes the induced Raman scattering that occurs when a 
signal light is entered into a silica fiber in a state of
having an intense pump light incident thereon (see J. Kani,
et al., Electronics Letters, Vol. 34, No. 18, pp. 1745-1747,
September 1998, for example).</p>
    <p num="0006">The second one is a dual wavelength pumped TDFA
(Thulium-Doped Fiber Amplifier) in which the population
inversion is low and the amplification bandwidth is shifted
to the long wavelength side by adding wavelengths with a
high efficiency for pumping from the ground level to the
amplification final energy level in the TDFA with 1000 nm
band upconversion pumping which has the amplification
bandwidth at S<sup>+</sup>-band (1450-1480 nm) (see, T. Kasamatsu, et
al., Optical Amplifiers and their Applications '99, Optical
Society of America Trends in Optics and Photonics Series
Vol. 30, pp. 46-50, June 1999, for example).</p>
    <p num="0007">Fig. 1A shows the energy levels of Tm and the
amplification state of the dual wavelength pumped TDFA. For
the amplification of the S-band, the stimulated emission
from <sup>3</sup> H<sub>4</sub> to <sup>3</sup> F<sub>4</sub>. In the case of the dual wavelength
pumping, the signal light is pumped from the ground level
<sup>3</sup> H<sub>6</sub> to the amplification final energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub> by the 1560
nm pump light, and then pumped from the amplification final
energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub> to the amplification initial energy level
<sup>3</sup> F<sub>2</sub> by the 1000 nm pump light. By controlling the powers of
the pump lights in two wavelengths so as to control the
number of Tm ions (Tm<sup>3+</sup>) at each level, a low population
inversion state is formed and the amplification bandwidth
of the TDFA in the S<sup>+</sup>-band is shifted to the S-band.</p>
    <p num="0008">Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1B, when the pumping
wavelength from the amplification final energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub> to
the amplification initial energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>2</sub> is changed from
the 1000 nm band to the 1400 nm band which has the higher
pumping efficiency, it is possible to realize the high
efficiency S-band optical fiber amplifier (see, T.
Kasamatsu, et al., Electronics Letters, Vol. 36, No. 19, 
pp. 1607-1609, September 2000, for example).</p>
    <p num="0009">The third one is a high Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration TDFA in
which the low population inversion is formed by the cross
relaxation among Tm<sup>3+</sup> generated in the pumping state and
the amplification bandwidth is shifted to the S-band on the
long wavelength region, by adding Tm which is the additive
ions to the optical fiber core which is the amplification
medium at a high Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration, in the 1000 nm band
upconversion pumping TDFA (see, S. Aozasa, et al.,
Electronics Letters, Vol. 36, No. 5, pp. 418-419, March
2000, for example).</p>
    <p num="0010">Fig. 2 shows the energy levels of Tm and the
amplification state of the high Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration TDFA.
The signal light is pumped once from the ground level <sup>3</sup> H<sub>6</sub>
to the amplification final energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub> by the 1000 nm
pump light, and then pumped further from the amplification
final energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub> to the amplification initial energy
level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>2</sub> by the pump light of the same wavelength.</p>
    <p num="0011">Now, in the low Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration TDFA, the high
population inversion is formed because the absorption of
Tm<sup>3+</sup> with respect to the pump light at a time of pumping
from the amplification final energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub> to the
amplification initial energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>2</sub> is higher than the
absorption of Tm<sup>3+</sup> with respect to the pump light at a time
of pumping from the ground level <sup>3</sup>H<sub>6</sub> to the amplification
final energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>.</p>
    <p num="0012">Such a low Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration TDFA has the
amplification bandwidth mostly in the S<sup>+</sup>-band described
above as a result of the high population inversion state,
and the amplification operation can be realized even in the
S-band although it is deviated from the peak wavelength of
the gain spectrum. The amplification efficiency in the S-band
by this low Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration TDFA is less than or
equal to that of the high Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration TDFA.</p>
    <p num="0013">In contrast, in the high Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration TDFA, the 
interaction among Tm<sup>3+</sup> occurs so that, as shown in Fig. 2,
Tm<sup>3+</sup> pumped to the amplification initial energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>2</sub>
is relaxed to the amplification final energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub> by
causing the energy transfer to the neighboring Tm<sup>3+</sup> at the
ground level <sup>3</sup>H<sub>6</sub>, while Tm<sup>3+</sup> that received the energy is
pumped to the amplification final energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub>. As a
result, the number of Tm<sup>3+</sup> pumped to the amplification
final energy level <sup>3</sup>F<sub>4</sub> is increased so that the low
population inversion is formed and the gain shift occurs.</p>
    <p num="0014">However, in the high Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration TDFA described
above, the laser diode (LD) for emitting the 1000 nm
wavelength band to be used for the pump light has not been
developed yet, so that its practical realization has been
difficult because it is difficult to realize a low cost and
a compact size, and the conversion efficiency is not very
good (approximately 5%).</p>
    <p num="0015">Also, even in the low Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration TDFA, the
laser diode (LD) for emitting the 1000 nm wavelength band
to be used for the pump light has not been developed yet,
so that its practical realization has been difficult
because it is difficult to realize a low cost and a compact
size, and the conversion efficiency in the S-band is less
than or equal to the high Tm<sup>3+</sup> concentration TDFA.</p>
    <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

    <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <heading>[First Embodiment]</heading>
    <p num="0021">Referring now to Fig. 3A to Fig. 5, the first
embodiment of an optical fiber amplifier according to the
present invention will be described in detail.</p>
    <p num="0022">Figs. 3A to 3C show schematic configurations of the
optical fiber amplifier of the first embodiment.</p>
    <p num="0023">Fig. 3A shows a schematic configuration of a forward
pumping type optical fiber amplifier 110 in which a pump
light 2 is entered along the same direction as a
propagating direction of a signal light 1. As shown in Fig.
3A, this optical fiber amplifier 110 has a configuration in
which optical isolators 112 are connected at both ends of
an amplification optical fiber 111 that contains thulium
(Tm) (preferably not less than 2000 ppmwt, more preferably
not less than 3000 ppmwt) in its core, a wavelength
division multiplexing type coupler 113 for multiplexing the
signal light 1 and the pump light 2 is connected between
the optical isolator 112 on the input side of the signal
light 1 (1480-1520 nm) and the amplification optical fiber
111, and a pump light source 114 for generating the pump 
light (1320-1480 nm) is connected to that coupler 113.</p>
    <p num="0024">Fig. 3B shows a schematic configuration of a backward
pumping type optical fiber amplifier 120 in which a pump
light 2 is entered along the opposite direction of a
propagating direction of the signal light 1. As shown in
Fig. 3B, this optical fiber amplifier 120 has a
configuration in which the coupler 113 and the pump light
source 114 are connected between the optical isolator 112
on the output side of the signal light 1 and the
amplification optical fiber 111, rather than between the
optical isolator 112 on the input side of the signal light
1 and the amplification optical fiber 111.</p>
    <p num="0025">Fig. 3C shows a schematic configuration of a
bidirectional pumping type optical fiber amplifier 130 in
which pump lights 2 are entered along both the same
direction and the opposite direction of a propagating
direction of the signal light 1. As shown in Fig. 3C, this
optical fiber amplifier 130 has a configuration in which
two couplers 113 are connected respectively between the
optical isolator 112 on the input side of the signal light
1 and the amplification optical fiber 111 and between the
optical isolator 112 on the output side of the signal light
1 and the amplification optical fiber 111, and two pump
light sources 114 are connected respectively to these
couplers 113.</p>
    <p num="0026">In the amplification optical fiber 111, a host glass
to which Tm is added can be a fluoride type glass (ZBLAN
glass having ZrF<sub>4</sub>, BaF<sub>2</sub>, LaF<sub>3</sub> or the like as a main
component, or In-Pb glass having InF<sub>2</sub>, BaF<sub>2</sub>, PbF<sub>2</sub> or the
like as a main component, for example) in which the non-radiative
transition is hard to occur, or a tellurite glass
having TeO<sub>2</sub> or the like as a main component.</p>
    <p num="0027">In this amplification optical fiber 111, Tm is
contained at least in its core so that it is possible to
cause the transition due to the stimulated.emission of Tm 
ions and therefore it is possible to realize the
amplification in the S-band.</p>
    <p num="0028">Here, it is preferable for the amplification optical
fiber 111 to contain Tm at least in its core at the
concentration not less than 2000 ppmwt because then it
becomes possible to realize a compact size by suppressing
the length of the amplification optical fiber 111. In
particular, it is more preferable for the amplification
optical fiber 111 to contain Tm at least in its core at the
concentration not less than 3000 ppmwt because then it
becomes possible to reduce the fluorescent lifetime of
amplification initial energy level to be not greater than
90% as the influence of the cross relaxation appears
prominently. Note that the above described concentration
should preferably be not greater than 10 wt% (or more
preferably be not greater than 6 wt%) from a viewpoint of
the currently available glass and fiber manufacturing
techniques.</p>
    <p num="0029">The coupler 113 can be a fused tapered type coupler, a
dielectric multi-layer film type coupler, a circulator
combined with a fiber grating, etc.</p>
    <p num="0030">The pump light source 114 can be a fiber Raman laser,
a laser diode (LD), etc.</p>
    <p num="0031">In this embodiment, the coupler 113 and the pump light
source 114 constitute a pump light input unit.</p>
    <p num="0032">The conversion efficiencies obtained in the cases of
pumping the signal light 1 (1480-1520 nm) by the pump light
2 (1320-1480 nm) using any one of ZBLAN glass (Zr type),
In-Pb glass and the tellurite glass as the host glass, and
using the amplification optical fiber 111 to which Tm is
added at the concentration of either one of 2000 ppmwt and
3000 ppmwt (altogether six cases) in the optical fiber
amplifier 110, 120 or 130 of the above described
configuration are shown in Fig. 4. Here, the conversion
efficiencies in the cases of using the conventional pump 
light (1047 nm) are also shown for the purpose of
comparison.</p>
    <p num="0033">As can be seen from Fig. 4, it is possible to improve
the conversion efficiency for all types of the host glass
for the amplification optical fiber 111. In particular, the
conversion efficiency can be further improved in the case
of the Tm concentration of 3000 ppmwt compared with the
case of the Tm concentration of 2000 ppmwt.</p>
    <p num="0034">Now, the relationship between the wavelength of the
pump light 2 and the conversion efficiency is shown in Fig.
5. The conversion efficiency of the amplification optical
fiber 111 that contains Tm at least in its core increases
when the wavelength of the pump light 2 becomes greater
than 1320 nm, becomes maximum in a vicinity of 1400 nm, and
mostly disappears when the wavelength of the pump light 2
exceeds 1520 nm. For this reason, the wavelength of the
pump light 2 should preferably be 1320-1520 nm, but in
order to set the amplification bandwidth to the S-band
(1480-1520 nm), it is preferably be in a range of 1320-1480
nm, or more preferably in a range of 1370-1460 nm because
the conversion efficiency can be made sufficiently high
(over 20% for 2000 ppmwt, over 25% for 3000 ppmwt) in this
case.</p>
    <p num="0035">Thus, according to the first embodiment, the pump
light 2 with the wavelength in the 1400 nm band which is
the same as that of the signal light 1 is used so that the
conversion efficiency of the signal light 1 can be
improved.</p>
    <heading>[Second Embodiment]</heading>
    <p num="0036">Referring now to Fig. 6A to Fig. 8, the second
embodiment of an optical fiber amplifier according to the
present invention will be described in detail. Here, those
elements which are substantially similar to the
corresponding elements in the first embodiment described 
above will be given the same reference numerals in the
figures and their description will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="0037">Figs. 6A to 6C show schematic configurations of the
optical fiber amplifier of the second embodiment.</p>
    <p num="0038">Fig. 6A shows a schematic configuration of a forward
pumping type optical fiber amplifier 210 in which the pump
light 2 and a auxiliary pumping light are entered along the
same direction as the propagating direction of the signal
light 1. As shown in Fig. 6A, this optical fiber amplifier
210 has a configuration in which the amplification optical
fiber 110 of the first embodiment described above is
modified by connecting an auxiliary coupler 213 between the
optical isolator 112 on the input side of the signal light
1 and the coupler 113, and connecting an auxiliary pump
light source 214 for generating an auxiliary pump light 3
with the wavelength in a range of at least one of ranges
630-720 nm, 740-830 nm, 1100-1300 nm, and 1500-2000 nm to
the auxiliary coupler 213. Here, the ranges 630-720 nm,
740-830 nm, 1100-1300 nm, and 1500-2000 nm are the high
absorption ranges of Tm as shown in Fig. 7.</p>
    <p num="0039">Note that, in the forward pumping type optical fiber
amplifier 210, the auxiliary coupler 213 and the auxiliary
pump light source 214 are provided at a position A1 between
the optical isolator 112 on the input side of the signal
light 1 and the coupler 113 so that the auxiliary pump
light 3 is entered along the same direction as the
propagating direction of the signal light 1 as shown in
Fig. 6A, but it is also possible to provide the auxiliary
coupler 213 and the auxiliary pump light source 214 at a
position A2 between the coupler 113 and the amplification
'optical fiber 111 so that the auxiliary pump light 3 is

light 1 so that the auxiliary pump light 3 is entered along
the opposite direction of the propagating direction of the
signal light 1, or enter the auxiliary pump light 3 by
combining any of these configurations.</p>
    <p num="0040">Fig. 6B shows a schematic configuration of a backward
pumping type optical fiber amplifier 220 in which the pump
light 2 and the auxiliary pump light 3 are entered along
the opposite direction of the propagating direction of the
signal light 1. As shown in Fig. 6B, this optical fiber
amplifier 220 has a configuration in which the optical
fiber amplifier 120 of the first embodiment described above
is modified by connecting the auxiliary coupler 213 at a
position B2 between the optical isolator 112 on the output
side of the signal light 1 and the coupler 113, and
connecting the auxiliary pump light source 214 to the
auxiliary coupler 213.</p>
    <p num="0041">Note that, in the backward pumping type optical fiber
amplifier 220, the auxiliary coupler 213 and the auxiliary
pump light source 214 are provided at a position B2 between
the optical isolator 112 on the output side of the signal
light 1 and the coupler 113 so that the auxiliary pump
light 3 is entered along the opposite direction of the
propagating direction of the signal light 1 as shown in
Fig. 6B, but it is also possible to provide the auxiliary
coupler 213 and the auxiliary pump light source 214 at a
position B1 between the amplification optical fiber 111 and
the coupler 113 so that the auxiliary pump light 3 is
entered along the opposite direction of the propagating
direction of the signal light 1, or provide the auxiliary
coupler 213 and the auxiliary pump light source 214 at a
position A between the optical isolator 112 on the input
side of the signal light 1 and the amplification optical
fiber 111 so that the auxiliary pump light 3 is entered
along the same direction as the propagating direction of 
the signal light 1, or enter the auxiliary pump light 3 by
combining any of these configurations.</p>
    <p num="0042">Fig. 6C shows a schematic configuration of a
bidirectional pumping type optical fiber amplifier 230 in
which the pump lights 2 and the auxiliary pump lights 3 are
entered along both the same direction and the opposite
direction of the propagating direction of the signal light
1. As shown in Fig. 6C, this optical fiber amplifier 230
has a configuration in which the amplification optical
fiber 130 of the first embodiment described above is
modified by connecting the auxiliary couplers 213
respectively at a position A2 between the optical isolator
112 on the input side of the signal light 1 and the
amplification optical fiber 111 and at a position B1
between the amplification optical fiber 111 and the optical
isolator 112 on the output side of the signal light 1, and
connecting the auxiliary pump light sources 214
respectively to the auxiliary couplers 213.</p>
    <p num="0043">Note that, in the bidirectional pumping type optical
fiber amplifier 230, the auxiliary couplers 213 and the
auxiliary pump light sources 214 are provided at a position
A2 between the optical isolator 112 on the input side of
the signal light 1 and the amplification optical fiber 111
and at a position B1 between the amplification optical
fiber 111 and the optical isolator 112 on the output side
of the signal light 1 so that the auxiliary pump lights 3
are entered along both the same direction and the opposite
direction of the propagating direction of the signal light
1 as shown in Fig. 6C, but it is also possible to enter the
auxiliary pump light 3 by providing the auxiliary coupler
213 and the auxiliary pump light source 214 at at least one
of the above described positions A1, A2, B1 and B2.</p>
    <p num="0044">In this embodiment, the coupler 213 and the pump light
source 214 constitute an auxiliary pump light input unit.</p>
    <p num="0045">The conversion efficiencies obtained in the cases of 
pumping the signal light 1 by two wavelengths of the pump
light 2 and the auxiliary pump light 3 using any one of
ZBLAN glass (Zr type), In-Pb glass and the tellurite glass
as the host glass, and using the amplification optical
fiber 111 to which Tm is added at the concentration of
either one of 2000 ppmwt and 3000 ppmwt (altogether six
cases) in the optical fiber amplifier 210, 220 or 230 of
the above described configuration are shown in Fig. 8.
Here, the wavelength of the auxiliary pump light is set to
be any one of 650 nm, 800 nm, 1200 nm, and 1560 nm. Also,
the conversion efficiencies in the cases of the first
embodiment described above (cases of using one wavelength
of the pump light 2 alone) are also shown for the purpose
of comparison.</p>
    <p num="0046">As can be seen from Fig. 8, it is possible to improve
the conversion efficiency in the S-band for all types of
the host glass for the amplification optical fiber 111, in
the case of using two wavelengths of the pump light 2 and
the auxiliary pump light 3 compared with the case of using
one wavelength of the pump light 2 alone. In particular,
the conversion efficiency in the S-band can be further
improved in the case of the Tm concentration of 3000 ppmwt
compared with the case of the Tm concentration of 2000
ppmwt.</p>
    <p num="0047">Thus, according to the second embodiment, the
auxiliary pump light 3 with the wavelength for which the
ground level absorption is greater is entered in addition
to the pump light 2 with the wavelength in the 1400 nm band
so that the conversion efficiency of the signal light 1 can
be improved even more than the case of the first embodiment
described above.</p>
    <heading>[Third Embodiment]</heading>
    <p num="0048">Referring now to Fig. 9A to Fig. 13F, the third
embodiment of an optical fiber amplifier according to the 
present invention will be described in detail. Here, those
elements which are substantially similar to the
corresponding elements in the first and second embodiments
described above will be given the same reference numerals
in the figures and their description will be omitted.</p>
    <p num="0049">Figs. 9A to 9C show schematic configurations of the
optical fiber amplifier of the third embodiment.</p>
    <p num="0050">Fig. 9A shows a schematic configuration of a forward
pumping type optical fiber amplifier 310 in which the pump
light 2 is entered along the same direction as the
propagating direction of the signal light 1. As shown in
Fig. 9A, this optical fiber amplifier 310 has a
configuration in which the amplification optical fiber 110
of the first embodiment described above is modified by
replacing the optical isolator 112 on the output side of
the signal light 1 with a reflection mirror 315 for
reflecting at least the signal light 1 among the signal
light 1 and the pump light 2, and replacing the optical
isolator 112 on the input side of the signal light 1 with
an optical circulator 316 for separating an input signal
light 1 and an output signal light 1.</p>
    <p num="0051">Fig. 9B shows a schematic configuration of a backward
pumping type optical fiber amplifier 320 in which the pump
light 2 is entered along the opposite direction of the
propagating direction of the signal light 1. As shown in
Fig. 9B, this optical fiber amplifier 320 has a
configuration in which the optical fiber amplifier 120 of
the first embodiment described above is modified by
replacing the optical isolator 112 on the output side of
the signal light 1 with the reflection mirror 315, and
replacing the optical isolator 112 on the input side of the
signal light 1 with the optical circulator 316.</p>
    <p num="0052">Fig. 9C shows a schematic configuration of a
bidirectional pumping type optical fiber amplifier 330 in
which the pump lights 2 are entered along both the same 
direction and the opposite direction of the propagating
direction of the signal light 1. As shown in Fig. 9C, this
optical fiber amplifier 330 has a configuration in which
the amplification optical fiber 130 of the first embodiment
described above is modified by replacing the optical
isolator 112 on the output side of the signal light 1 with
the reflection mirror 315, and replacing the optical
isolator 112 on the input side of the signal light 1 with
the optical circulator 316.</p>
    <p num="0053">In this embodiment, the reflection mirror 315
constitutes a signal light turnaround propagation unit.</p>
    <p num="0054">The gain spectra obtained in the cases of pumping the
signal light 1 by the pump light 2 using the double pass
type optical fiber amplifier 330 of the above described
configuration in which the amplification optical fiber 111
has ZBLAN glass (Zr type) as the host glass and the Tm
concentration of either one of 2000 ppmwt and 6000 ppmwt
are shown in Fig. 10 (case of 2000 ppmwt) and Fig. 11 (case
of 6000 ppmwt). Here, the input power of the signal light 1
is -13 dbm/ch(×4ch), the wavelength of the pump light 2
from one pump light source 114 is 1400 nm, the wavelength
of the pump light 2 from another pump light source 114 is
1415 nm,, the total output power of the pump light sources
114 is 500 mW, and the length of the amplification optical
fiber 111 is optimized such that a high gain can be
obtained in the S-band. Also, the gain spectra in the cases
of Fig. 3C of the first embodiment described above (single
pass type using the length of the amplification optical
fiber 111 is 16 m) are also shown for the purpose of
comparison.</p>
    <p num="0055">As can be seen from Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, it is
possible to improve the gain in the S-band (1480-1520 nm)
by the third embodiment (double pass type) compared with
the first embodiment (single pass type) described above. In
particular, the gain in the S-band can be further improved 
and the flatness of the gain can be improved in the case of
the Tm concentration of over 3000 ppmwt (6000 ppmwt in this
example) compared with the case of the Tm concentration of
2000 ppmwt.</p>
    <p num="0056">Also, the relationships between the length of the
amplification optical fiber 111 (Tm concentration: 6000
ppmwt) and the conversion efficiency in the S-band in the
cases of the first embodiment (single pass type) described
above and the third embodiment (double pass type) are shown
in Fig. 12. Note that the conditions on the signal light 1
are the same in both cases.</p>
    <p num="0057">As shown in Fig. 12, the single pass type can obtain a
characteristic in which the gains at the 1480 nm and 1510
nm approximately coincide when the fiber length is 15.5 to
17 m, whereas the double pass type can obtain a
characteristic in which the gains at the 1480 nm and 1510
nm approximately coincide when the fiber length is 6 to 8
m. The conversion efficiency of this fiber length for which
the gains approximately coincide is about 24% for the
single pass type and about 35% for the double pass type.</p>
    <p num="0058">In the configurations of Figs. 9A to 9C of the third
embodiment, the reflection mirror 315 can be provided in
various forms such as those shown in Figs. 13A to 13F. More
specifically, Fig. 13A shows a reflection mirror realized
by applying a gold vapor deposition to an end face of a
vertically cut optical fiber. Fig. 13B shows a reflection
mirror realized by attaching a dielectric multi-layer film
at an end face of a vertically cut optical fiber. Fig. 13C
shows a reflection mirror realized by a metallic mirror for
reflecting lights emitted from a fiber end face back into
the fiber. Fig. 13D shows a reflection mirror realized by
inserting a Faraday rotator between the fiber end face and
the metallic mirror in the reflection mirror of Fig. 13C.
Fig. 13E shows a fiber grating type reflection mirror
realized by providing periodic refractive index variations 
along a length direction of the optical fiber such that the
entered lights will be reflected by the Bragg reflection.
Fig. 13F shows a loop mirror type reflection mirror in
which the lights are propagated through a looped
polarization-preserving optical fiber and re-coupled by a 3
dB coupler.</p>
    <p num="0059">Thus, according to the third embodiment, the
conversion efficiency of the signal light 1 can be improved
even more than the case of the first embodiment described
above.</p>
