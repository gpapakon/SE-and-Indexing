  <description load-source="ep" status="new" lang="EN">
    <p num="0001">The present invention relates to a biodegradable polycation composition as well as
to a biodegradable polycation complex of said composition together with a
polyanidn.</p>
    <p num="0002">More specifically, the present application is directed to cationic polysaccharide
derivatives made from the conjugation of oligoamines onto a polysacchide chain
wherein said oligoamine conjugated polysaccharide further comprises hydrophobic
or amphiphilic groups along the polymer chain. The oligoamines having at least
two amino groups are conjugated with at least one oligomer per five saccharide
units. The hydrophobic groups including saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons
derived from for example natural and synthetic fatty acids; cholesterol derivatives,
aromatic groups such as naphthyl and benzyl groups, and the like. The
hydrophobic and amphiphilic groups are positioned with at least one group per 50
saccharide units.</p>
    <p num="0003">Gene therapy is a process by which genes are introduced into cells which then
become mini-factories which manufacture and release essential compounds in
cells and tissue which improve the life of the patient. Gene therapy has the
potential to revolutionize the treatment of genetic disorders, diseases associated
with a genetic component like cancer, AIDS, and many other diseases. Gene
therapy may be the only remedy for some individuals who would otherwise die or
be severely disabled. Gene transfer may also be employed for systemic protein
and peptide-like hormone administration. Nucleic acid sequences coding for a
protein (insulin, growth hormone) would be administered to the patient allowing
endogenous production of their own medication.</p>
    <p num="0004">Successful gene therapy requires the identification of an appropriate therapeutic
gene for treatment of the disease, in addition to a delivery system by which that
gene can be delivered to desired cell type both efficiently and accurately. Early
attempts of gene transfer involved the removal of cells from the individual, and the
alteration of the cells in the culture by the introduction of a functioning copy of the
gene. The next step included grafting the genetically engineered cells back into the 
patient. This ex vivo approach to gene therapy is obviously limited to those target
tissues that are not undergoing frequent multiplication and cell generation that
could cause progressing elimination of the grafted cells. The ability of the altered
cells to efficiently recombine with the target tissue is another limiting factor of the
ex vivo approach since many cells do not exhibit the ability to recombine.</p>
    <p num="0005">The limitation and the complexity of the ex-vivo approach facilitated the
development of direct in vivo gene transfer methods. Direct gene therapy involves
the administration of the gene into the body, targeting of the gene to the desired
cells and into the nucleus of said genes, and expression of functioning gene
products therein. Currently there are two different approaches for direct gene
transfer. One is a viral approach and the other is a non-viral approach. Viral and
non-viral gene therapies differ in the methods used to deliver genes to the target
cells and direct the uptake of gene into the nucleus. Viral gene therapies employ
genetically engineered viral particles to deliver the gene to target cell, and non-viral
gene therapies employ gene delivery systems comprised of synthetic or
semi-synthetic gene formulations. The limitations of viral therapies relate to the
residual viral elements within the viral vectors which can be immunogenic ,
cytopathic, or recombinogenic.</p>
    <p num="0006">Antisense technology has introduced the possibility of down-regulating or
specifically turning off the expression of individual genes. This technology has
enormous therapeutic potential. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AON or ODN)
constitute sequences of 15 to 21 nucleotides with the order of the nucleotides
providing the molecule with the specificity to target genetic material. An
oligonucleotide whose bases are tailored to complement part of a particular
mRNA, can bind to and complex with that section of the mRNA. This can prevent
gene expression which may prevent protein synthesis by passive or reactive
inhibition of mRNA translation. Antisense ODN's to DNA seem to inhibit DNA
transcription by formation of a triple helix.</p>
    <p num="0007">Antisense oligonucleotides enter cells by pinocytosis and/or receptor-mediated
endocytosis after binding to cell surface antigens. Uncharged oligomers enter cells
by passive diffusion and charged oligomers enter by endocytosis. It seems that 
oligomers are not internalized by cells very efficiently. Methods for improving
cellular uptake and biological efficacy of ODN's have been devised, including their
conjugation to a synthetic polypeptide poly(L-lysine) tail with or without transferrin,
or encapsulation in cationic or antibody - targeted liposomes.</p>
    <p num="0008">As with other modes of contemporary gene therapy, delivery remains a central and
crucial issue. For example, Antisense oligonucleotides per se are thought not to
cross the intact Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). There are no studies analyzing the
passage of antisense oligomers across the Blood Brain Barrier. Attempts to deliver
them across the BBB by hyperosmotic BBB disruption after conjugation or by
incorporation into liposomes have, as a whole, been unsuccessful. Direct injection
of free antisense results in their rapid breakdown.</p>
    <p num="0009">Although, most research in vivo gene therapy has focused on the use of
recombinant virus vectors, progress has been made toward developing non-viral
formulations of gene for in vivo human gene therapy. The advantages of non-viral
vectors are that they can introduce DNA into non-dividing cells, do not integrate
into the chromosome, do not posses infective risk, and are potentially less
expansive than viral vectors. The principle underlying non-viral gene delivery is
that the problem of delivering DNA in vivo is not significantly different from the
problem of delivering conventional drugs or biological products to intracellular
compartment in the body. Non-viral gene therapies involve known drug delivery
methods for the administration and targeting of genes to selected cells in vivo,
where they express therapeutic products.</p>
    <p num="0010">Various methods have been described for non-viral gene therapy, ranging from the
direct administration of "naked" plasmid DNA to the systemic administration of
complex synthetic formulations. Some approaches are aimed at developing
"artificial viruses" that attempt to mimic the process of viral infection using
synthetic or semi-synthetic components. Others apply the theory and method of
advanced, particulate drug delivery to administer DNA to selected somatic targets.
These approaches employ plasmid DNA complexes containing lipids, proteins,
peptides, or polymeric carriers. The principle disadvantage associated with
non-viral systems has been insufficient levels of gene expression, irreproducibility 
and significant variations in gene expression on various cell types.</p>
    <p num="0011">The two classes of synthetic gene delivery systems that have been investigated
most actively involve the use of either cationic liposomes or polycationic polymers.
The assembly of these systems is achieved by an electrostatic condensation of
the "anionic" DNA with the "cationic" moiety of either a lipid or a synthetic polymer.
The cationic polymer-based systems have been most widely associated with the
formulation of receptor-mediated gene delivery systems. This technique employs
the ability of receptors on the surface of a variety of different cells to efficiently bind
and internalize a ligand. Several ligands have been exploited for the efficient
internalization of DNA-ligands complexes. These include: asialoorosmucoid and
other galactosylated proteins which target the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor;
transferrin which binds to the transferrin receptor and mannosyl which is
recognized by the mannose receptor of macrophages. Targeting ligands are
covalently linked to a polycation polymer, typically to poly(lysine) derivatives, and
then form a ligand-poly(lysine)-DNA complex by the ionic interaction between the
positively charged poly(lysine) and the negatively charged DNA. Often, an
endosomolytic agent is added to the transfection mixture to induce endosomal
lysis and enhance DNA release from the endosome in order to achieve high
transfection efficiency. The efficiency of poly(lysine)-DNA conjugates in
transfecting numerous cell types in vitro has been demonstrated, but their
potential usefulness for in vivo human gene therapy is limited due to their
cytotoxicity.</p>
    <p num="0012">More advanced polymeric gene delivery systems employ macromolecules with a
very high cationic charge density that act as an endosomal buffering system, thus
suppressing the endosomal enzymes activity and protecting the DNA from
degradation. The high cationic charge density mediates both DNA condensing and
buffering capacity, that diminish the requirement for an endosomolytic agent
addition.</p>

    <p num="0013">The polycations used for gene complexation are polyamines that become
cationic at physiologic conditions All polymers contain either primary, secondary, 
tertiary or quaternary amino groups capable of forming electrostatic complexes
with DNA under physiologic conditions. The highest transfection activity is
obtained at a 1.1 -1.5 ratio of polycation to DNA. The most studied polyamines for
gene transfer includes, poly(lysine) and its derivatives, polyamidoamine starburst
dendrimers, polyethyleneimine, natural and modified polysaccharides, and acrylic
cationic polymers. The details for each polymer class are described in Domb et al.
(A. Domb, M. Levy, Polymers in gene therapy, Frontiers in Biological Polymer
Applications, R.M. Ottenbrite (ed), Technomic, Vol. 2, 1999,1-16.).</p>
    <p num="0014">Polycations may be more versatile for use than the liposomes and other
conventionally used spherical gene carriers. Several polycations have been
reported to induce gene expression for example diethylaminoethyl dextran and
other cationized polysaccharides [F.D. Ledley, Huiman Gene Therapy, 6, 1129,
1995; Yamaoka et al. Chemistry Letters, 1171-72, 1998]. These polymers have
little structural similarity with each other except possessing cationic groups.</p>
    <p num="0015">Cationic polysaccharides have been used for gene delivery. Chitosan, a linear
cationic polysaccharide was suggested by several authors for gene delivery [K.W.
Leong et al, DNA-Chitosan nanospheres: Transfection efficiency and cellular
uptake, Proceed. Intl. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater. 24:75-76, 651-652,
671-674, 1997; R. Richardson, H.V.J. Kolbe, R. Buncan, Evaluation of highly
purified chitosan as a potential gene delivery vector, Proceed. Intl. Symp. Control.
Rel. Bioact. Mater. 24:649-650, 1997] DNA-chitosan nanospheres were found to
be significantly less toxic than poly(L-lysine) or Lipofectin using the MTT test.
Compared to standard Lipofectamine mediated gene transfer, these nanospheres
yield lower levels of gene expression in HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney cells),
IB3 (bronchial epithelial cells) and HTE (human tracheal epithelial cells). Surface
modification of DNA/chitosan complex nanoparticles by covalently binding
poly(ethylene glycol), transferrin and mannose-6-phosphate receptor to facilitate
entry into cells and improve storage stability was also studied. The Purified and
hydrophobized chitosan has also been suggested as carrier for genes [K.Y. Lee,
I.C. Kwon, Y.H. Kim, W.H. Jo, S.Y. Jeong, Selfaggregates of hydrophobically
modified chitosan for DNA delivery, Proceed. Intl. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact.
Mater. 24:651-652, 1997]. </p>
    <p num="0016">Midox (WO 95/30020) describes a polypeptide such as polylysine modified at the
g-amino group with a molecule bearing hydroxyl groups. Genzyme describes in
WO 97/462 lipid derivatives of short chain alkylamines such as spermine and
spermidine for use in gene transfection. For example one or two spermine or
spermidine groups attached to cholesterol via an amide or carbamate bonds. WO
98/27209 to Emory Univ. describe a range of modified cationic polypeptides based
on lysine for use in gene transfection.</p>
    <p num="0017">The polymers described in the prior art can be grouped into two catagories: One
including linear or dendrimeric polymers with random distribution of amino groups
which are part of the polymer backbone such as poly(ethylene imines),
poly(amido-amine) dendrimers, and poly(alkylamino-glucaramide). The second
including linear polymers with a single primary secondary or tertiary amino group
attached to the polymer units. Examples of such polymers are:
poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylates), dimethylamino dextran, and polylysines.</p>
    <p num="0018">All of the above polymers are polycations with a random distribution of the cationic
sites. This randomness is probably the reason for the fact that these polymers may
work for some nucleotides and cell types and not for others. Most of these
polymers are toxic to cells and non-biodegradable, while the polymers based on
amino acids such as polylysines are immunogenic.</p>
    <p num="0019">It can be said that in the prior art, little attention was given to:
<sl><li>1. the structure of the polycation, the charge density and space distribution
of cationic groups in the polymer to optimize complexation with anionic
nucleotides;</li><li>2. the type of cationic groups, primary, secondary or tertiary groups were
considered as cationic sites.</li><li>3. the toxicity and immunogenicity of the polymer;</li><li>4. the biodegradability and elimination properties of the polymer carrier;</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0020">In general, it has been believed that the cationic charge of the polymers is the
main factor important for complexation and transfection. Also, these cationic 
polymers did not result in high enough transfection yield for commercial interest in
ex-vivo experiments, in addition to animal experimentation.. The degradation and
elimination of the polymer carrier was not carefully treated and most polycations
described for use in gene therapy are not biodegradable and/or toxic.</p>
    <p num="0021">In designing a universal polycation system for gene delivery one should consider
the way in which a plasmid becomes active in the cell and tissue. The plasmid has
first to be protected from DNA degrading enzymes in the extracellular medium,
then penetrate the cell wall, protected from degrading systems, i.e. the lisosome
and enzymes, in the intracellular medium until it is internalized in the nucleus,
penetrate into the nucleus and being released in its active form from the polymer
carrier.</p>
    <p num="0022">This invention describes a versatile and universal polycation system based on
oligoamine grafted on natural or synthetic polysaccharides that is capable of
complexing various plasmids and antisense, administering them into various cells
in high yields and into the nucleus in active form to produce the desired protein.</p>
    <p num="0023">It is the objective of the present invention to provide polycations that:
<sl><li>1. better fit the complexation requirements for effective delivery of a
plasmid or an antisense;</li><li>2. biodegrade into non-toxic fragments at a controlled rate;</li><li>3. non-toxic and no-immunogenic in vivo;</li><li>4. form a stable enough complex with low and high molecular weight
polynucleotides including therapeutic plasmids and antisense.</li><li>5. provide effective polymeric delivery system that result in a high transfection
yield in a range of cells and in tissues.</li><li>6. can be reproducibly prepared at an affordable cost.</li></sl></p>
    <p num="0024">Another objective of this invention is to provide a controlled release of DNA in
tissue or cell by complexing DNA with designed polymers that gradually
de-complex and release the DNA or by incorporation of the complexed
polynucleotides in a biodegradable matrix which will release the DNA in the site of
insertion for periods of weeks and months. </p>

    <p num="0046">The present invention provides a range of biodegradable polycations based on
grafted oligoamine residues on synthetic or a natural polysaccharides which are
effective in delivering plasmids and antisense for a high biological effect. The
grafting concept where side chain oligomers are attached to either a linear or
branched hydrophilic polysaccharide backbone, allows two/three dimensional
interaction with an anionic surface area typical to the double or single strand DNA
chain. This type of flexible cationic area coverage is not available with non-grafted
polycations or low molecular weight cations. Low molecular weight amines and
their lipid derivatives such as the lipofectin and lipofectamine have a localized
effect on the DNA which the degree of complexation is dependent on how these
small molecules organized around the anionic DNA. Each molecule has to be
synchronized with the other molecules at all times of the transferction process
whereas when the oligoamines are grafted on a polymer they are already
synchronized and each side chain helps the other side chains to be arranged to fit
the anionic surface of the given DNA. By grafting the functional groups is an
average distribution along a polymer chain at a certain distance between each
other (for example, grafting an oligoamine chain every one, two, three or four
polymer unit may provide optimal complexation with various DNAs.</p>
    <p num="0047">The use of biodegradable cationic polyol carriers is especially suitable for
transfection and biological applications because they are water soluble and
miscible in aqueous vehicles. The resultant grafted polymers are water soluble or
dispersible in water, it can be readily transported to cells <i>in vivo</i> by known
biological processes, and acts as an effective vehicle for transporting agents 
complexed with it.</p>
    <p num="0048">The compositions of the present invention are composed of a natural or synthetic
polysaccharide backbone with a grafted complexation functionality, i.e. aliphatic
organic cationic residues containing at least two amino groups. The alkyl amino
cationic residues are distributed in an optimal charge distribution tailored for as
many plasmid or oligonucleotide for optimal transfection results. The polymer has

      <b>Detailed Description of the Invention:</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0049">The present invention provides a new class of non-viral polymeric vectors that can
be used for both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> transfer of biologically active molecules. In
particular, these vectors can be used for gene transfer applications. The
polycationic compositions of the present invention can achieve gene transfer
efficiencies <u style="single">in vitro</u> that are superior to commercially available cationic liposome
preparations. Further, the low toxicity and lack of serum inhibition of the
compositions is suitable for <i>in vivo</i> use. The present invention provides a vector
that can achieve <i>in vivo</i> gene transfer efficiencies that compare favorably to viral
vector systems. The present invention further provides a method to increase the
capacity of solutions to carry complexes of nucleic acids and the polymeric vector
without precipitation or toxic ionic effects on cells.</p>
    <p num="0050">Furthermore, the unique polycationic structure of this class of polymers associates
with many suitable bioactive molecules, including proteins and other compounds
that possess multiple anionic sites. The polymer can act as a carrier to deliver the
associated bioactive molecule, <i>in vivo</i> or <i>in vitro,</i> to the cells of interest for the
bioactive molecule.</p>
    <p num="0051">In addition, the unique polycationic structure of this class of polymers are
biodegradable and readily eliminated from the body after administration.</p>
    <p num="0052">In one aspect the invention provides a complex comprising a nucleic acid and a

    <p num="0053">As used herein the term "transfection agent" means any chemical agent capable
of facilitating the entry of a nucleic acid into a eukaryotic cell.</p>
    <p num="0054">As used herein the term "nucleic acid" means a polymer of nucleotides, and
specifically includes plasmids, coding DNA sequences, mRNAs, and antisense
RNA molecules. A nucleic acid can be single - or double - stranded. The nucleic
acids can also contain one or more substitute linkages. These substitute linkages
include conventional alternative linkages such as phosphorothioate and
phosphoramidate, and are synthesized as described in generally available
literature. Nucleic acids also include those nucleotides in which the sugar moiety
has been modified by, for example, substitution of one or more hydroxyl groups
with halogen, aliphatic groups, or functionalized as ethers, amines, or wherein the
ribose or deoxyribose is replaced with other functionally equivalent structures. In
particular, the sugar-phosphate backbone may be replaced with a
non-carbohydrate backbone such as a peptide or other type of polymer.</p>
    <p num="0055">As used herein the term "primary amine" means any amine that possesses one or
more primary amine functionality. </p>
    <p num="0056">As used herein the term "secondary amine" includes amine moieties having at
least two pendent hydrocarbon groupings, and also includes, in the appropriate
context, tertiary and quaternary amines.</p>
    <p num="0057">As used herein "a" can mean one or more, depending upon the context in which it
is used.</p>
    <p num="0058">As used herein "aliphatic" and "aromatic hydrocarbons" include both substituted
and unsubstituted compounds, wherein the substitution can occur in the backbone
or pendent groupings of the hydrocarbon. Aliphatic compounds may be branched
or straight chained.</p>
    <p num="0059">As used herein "polysaccharide" means, linear, branched or crosslinked natural or
chemically modified polysaccharides. It also includes synthetic copolymers having
at least 40% saccharide units in the polymer backbone. A particular example is
polyamides of glucaric acid with alkanediamines.</p>
    <p num="0060">As used here "oligoamine" means a linear, cyclic and branched alkaneamine that
contain at least two amino groups. The molecular weight of the oligoamine is
limited to about 2,000 Daltons.</p>
    <p num="0061">The present invention relates to a novel class of polycationic polysaccharides
having effective nucleic acid transfection properties and bioactive agent delivery
attributes. The polymers are obtained from the conjugation of an oligoamine to a
polysaccharide chain. The polysaccharide carrier, the oligoamine and the grafting
ratio bond type are selected to enhance the degree and efficiency of transfection.
For example, polymers can be selected based upon the density and distribution of
the cationic sites on the polymer to obtain transfection agents that are tailored to
the anionic charge distribution of the nucleic acid being transfected, and the
anionic charge distribution of the type cell being targeted. Various substituents can
also be incorporated into the polymer to affect the properties of the polymer by
improving the transfection efficiency thereof.</p>
    <p num="0062">The present invention provides (1) a class of polycationic polymers, (2) a class of
complexes comprising these polymers with nucleic acids, and (3) a class of 
complexes comprising these polymers with suitable anionically charged bioactive
agents. The class of polycationic polymers comprises products obtained by the
grafting of an oligoalkaneamine onto a suitable polysaccharide, wherein the
grafted oligoamine contains at least Two amines. in a particularly preferred
embodiment, the grafted primary amine has one primary amine and three
secondary amines.</p>
    <p num="0063">Examples of suitable polysaccharides include, for example, dextrans,
arabinogalactan, pullulan, cellulose, chitosan, inuline, hyaluronic acid, and
alginates having from 2 to 2,000 saccharide units. Other classes of
polysaccharides are polyureas or polyamides of aldaric acids such as mucic acid,
glucaric acid, galactaric acid, xylaric acid, and their various isomers
polycondenced with aliphatic diamines. The copolymerization of the comonomers
may be performed generally by methods known in the art, including by
condensation reactions. Examples of suitable polycondensation techniques are
described in detail in Kieley et al., <u style="single">J. American Chemical Society</u>, 116, 571-578
(1994), Kieley et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,225,012; 5,434,233; 5,312,967; 5,473,035;
5,833,230; and 5,329,044; and Dewar et al.</p>
    <p num="0064">The ionic association of the polymer/nucleic acid charges neutralizes the anionic
charges on the nucleic acid and allows the complex to interact and bind more
favorably with the negatively charged cell surface. If an excess of cationic sites are
present on the polymer, i.e. more than are necessary to neutralize the anionic
charges on the nucleic acids, these excess cationic charges may facilitate the
attraction of the complex to the ionically charged surface of the cell, thereby
facilitating entry of the complex into the cell. The polymers may also compact the
nucleic acids upon complexation, which further enhances the likelihood of entry.</p>
    <p num="0065">Although the present invention is limited to grafted oligoalkylamines, various
substitutents can be incorporated into the polymer carrier. For example, the
hydroxyl groups on the aliphatic chain of the monosaccharides can be substituted
with aliphatic hydrocarbons, amides, azo, carbamate, carboxylic esters, ethers,
thioethers, thiols, fluorescent derivatives, and sulfonic acids. One is often able to
increase the hydrophobicity of the polymer (where hydrophobicity is desired) by 
alkylating the secondary amines with long chain hydrocarbons. Alternatively, one
may increase the amphiphilicity by attaching a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain.</p>
    <p num="0066">The structure of the polymer can also be altered, by known techniques, to optimize
the transfection and delivery efficiency of the polymer for each cellular target on
the basis of the physiological and biological characteristics of that target. For
example, the efficiency of gene delivery to cells can be enhanced by the addition
of peptides with the nuclear targeting signal of simian virus 40 to the polymer.
Several protein ligands are also known that can be covalently coupled to the
polymer and then incorporated into a ligand-nucleic acid complex. The resulting
complexes retain their ability to interact specifically with cognate receptors on the
target cell.</p>
    <p num="0067">Another method for improving the efficiency of gene delivery is to enhance the
release of DNA from the endosome after it has entered the cell. Adenoviral
particles can be coupled to the polymer to increase this efficiency. Synthetic
peptides can also be designed and incorporated into the polymer in order to
enhance endosomal release.</p>
    <p num="0068">The biodegradable polycation compositions of the present invention are of general
use for gene transfer and bioactive agent delivery with respect both to cell type
and size of nucleic acid or bioactive agent because the transfection is driven by
ionic interactions. Any selected cell into which transfection of a nucleic acid or
delivery of a bioactive agent (via transfection or other means) would be useful can
be targeted by this method, by administering the composition in a suitable manner
to bring the complosition into contact with the selected cell, as is known in the art.
Cells can be within a tissue or organ, for example, supplied by a blood vessel into
which the composition is administered. The composition of the present invention
can be formulated into a slab, pellet, microsphere and nanosphere made of a
biodegradable component such as a biodegradable polymer or fat to allow
targeting and/or controlling long term release of the gene complex to the blood
system or to a specific site as known in the literature for common bioactive
molecules. Alternatively, for example, the composition can be directly injected into
the target tissue or organ. As a further example, the lungs can be targeted by 
inhalation or intratracheal injection of the complex or particles containing the
complex. The invention has application to all eukaryotic cells; it can be used
particularly for mammalian cells and subjects, such as humans, cows, horses,
sheep, pigs, rats and mice. Some examples of cells that can be targeted by the
composition of the present invention include fibroblasts, epithelial cells, endothelial
cells, blood cells and tumor cells.</p>
    <p num="0069">Due to the fact that the polyol backbone according to one of the embodiments of
the invention is both biodegradable and regularly imported into living cells as part
of normal biosynthetic processes, it is nontoxic and nonimmunogenic, which offers
a distinct advantage over viral vectors when used as transfection agents. Similarly
because polyols do not generally contain natural binding sites for serum, the polyol
backbone is not negatively impacted by circulating serum proteins such as
herparin and albumin. Complexes formed with the polymers thus reach targeted
cells intact without significant serum inhibition, in contrast to polycationic lipids
which are substantially impacted by natural systemic serums.</p>
    <p num="0070">The amount of DNA that is carried in solution can also influence the degree of
transfection of the composition. The concentration of DNA in solution is often
limited by its tendency to precipitate at higher concentrations. In some
applications, the DNA concentration in solution is limited to about 1.0 g/l.
Increased amounts of DNA-polymer in solution which does not precipitate, may be
achieved if proper methods of preparation and optimal polymer to DNA ratio and
polymer structure are used. In such preparations it may be possible to obtain
solutions carrying 20 grams of DNA per litter of solution.</p>
    <p num="0071">Suitable delivery and transfection conditions are when the cell and composition
temperature is between about 18Â°C and about 42Â°C, with a preferred temperature
being between about 22Â°C and about 37Â°C. For administration to a cell in a
subject, the complex, once in the subject, will of course adjust to the subject's
body temperature. For <i>ex vivo</i> administration, the complex can be administered by
any standard method that would maintain viability of the cells, such as by adding
the complex to a culture medium (appropriate for the target cells) and adding this
medium directly to the cells. The medium used in this method should be aqueous 
and non-toxic so as not to render the cells non-viable. In addition, the medium can
contain nutrients for maintaining viability of cells, if desired.</p>
    <p num="0072">The composition can be administered <i>in vivo</i> by parenteral administration, e.g., by
intravenous injection including regional perfusion through a blood vessel supplying
the tissue(s) or organ(s) having the target cell(s). Injectables can be prepared in
conventional forms, such as liquid solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. A slow
release or sustained release system can also be used, allowing the maintenance
of a constant dosage level.</p>
    <p num="0073">Other means of administration can include inhalation of an aerosol, subcutaneous,
intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection, topical administration such as to skin
wounds and lesions, direct transfection into, e.g., bone marrow cells prepared for
transplantation and subsequent transplantation into the subject, and direct
transfection into an organ that is subsequently transplanted into the subject.
Further administration methods can include oral administration, particularly when
the complex is encapsulated, or rectal administration, particularly when the
complex is in suppository form.</p>
    <p num="0074">A pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can include the
composition and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for the selected
mode of administration. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any
material that will not cause any undesirable biological effects or interact in a
deleterious manner with the biological host or with the components within the
pharmaceutical composition. A pharmaceutical composition can further include
other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, adjuvant, diluents, stabilizers, etc.,
as long as they do not interfere with the action of the composition. Actual methods
of preparing such dosage forms are known or will be apparent to those skilled in
the art, (for example - Martin, E.W. <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,</i> latest
edition, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA.)</p>
    <p num="0075">Transfections using combinations of a plasmid:polycation complex of this invention
and various cationic, anionic and amphiphilic polymers and molecules. the plasmid
dna complex consisted of plasmid dna, oligoamine polysaccharide condensing
agent and a peptide (a peptide described in u.s. patent application ser. no. 
07/913,669, filed jul. 14, 1992). addition of amphipathic polymers: polyethylene
glycol (PEG); polypropylene glycol (PPG) and PEG-PPG copolymers,
phosphatidyl choline, cholesterol derivatives, and non-ionic surfactants, the
transfection efficiency of the plasmid dna complex was significantly enhanced over
the plasmid dna complex alone or the polymers alone. The addition of an anionic
polymer or lipid may result in destabilization of the net positively charged plasmid
dna complex by its negative charge and thus may better release the plasmid in the
nucleus or in the other hand may de-complex the plasmid and the activity may be
reduced. Several mechanisms of action of amphipathic polymers may account
including: stabilization of plasmid dna complexes due to coating; increased cell
membrane permeability, thereby allowing easier passage of the plasmid dna
complex through the cell; membrane and/or volume exclusion, increasing the
concentration of plasmid dna complexes at the cell surface.</p>
    <p num="0076">Another objective of this invention is to provide a controlled release of biologically
active dna in tissue or cell by complexing them with the polycations of this
invention that gradually de-complex and release the biomacromolecule, DNA,
antisence, and a protein or a polysaccharide (heparin) or by incorporation of the
complex in a biodegradable matrix, which will release the DNA or DNA complex in
the site of insertion for periods of weeks and months.</p>
    <p num="0077">The following polymers, oils and surfactants may be suitable for use as
compounds which enhance gene transfection and/or prolong the localized
bioavailability of a nucleic acid: salts of hyaluronates; salts of alginates;
heteropolysaccharides (pectins); poloxamers (pluronics); poloxamines (tetronics);
polyethylene glycols; dextrans; polyvinylpyrrolidones; chitosans; polyvinylalcohols;
propylene glycols; phosphatidylcholines (lecithins); xanthan gum, polyethylene
glycol-polylactic -glycolic acid (PEG-PLA), polyethylene glycol-polyhydroxybutyric
acid (PEG-PHB), fatty acid and alcohols and their esters, glycofurol, cremophors,
and oil mixtures. These substances may be prepared as solutions, suspensions,
gels, emulsions or microemulsions of a water/oil (w/o), water/oil/water (w/o/w),
oil/water (o/w) or oil/water/oil (o/w/o) type. Oil suspensions of lyophilized nucleic
acid, such as plasmid DNA may be utilized. Carriers for these oil suspensions
include, but are not limited to, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, lecithins, 
tweens, spans and miglyols. by "solutions" is meant water soluble polymers and/or
surfactants in solution with nucleic acids. By "suspensions" is meant water
insoluble oils containing suspended nucleic acids. By "gels" is meant high viscosity
polymers containing nucleic acids. By "emulsion" is meant a dispersed system
containing at least two immiscible liquid phases. Emulsions usually have dispersed
particles in the 0.02 to 100 micron range. Nucleic acids in the water phase can be
dispersed in oil to make a w/o emulsion. This w/o emulsion can be dispersed in a
separate aqueous phase to yield a w/o/w emulsion. Alternatively, a suitable oil
could be dispersed in an aqueous phase to form an o/w emulsion. A
"microemulsion" has properties intermediate to micelles and emulsions and is
characterized in that they are homogenous, transparent and thermodynamically
stable. They form spontaneously when oil, water, surfactant and cosurfactant are
mixed together. Typically, the diameter of the dispersed phase is 0.01 to 0.1
microns, usually of the w/o and o/w type.</p>
    <p num="0078">The compounds which prolong the bioavailability of a nucleic acid may also
interact or associate with the nucleic acid by intermolecular forces and/or valence
bonds such as: van der waals forces, ion-dipole interactions, ion-induced dipole
interactions, hydrogen bonds, or ionic bonds. These interactions may serve the
following functions: (1) stereoselectively protect nucleic acids from nucleases by
shielding; (2) facilitate the cellular uptake of nucleic acid by endocytosis. To
achieve the desired effects set forth it is desirable, but not necessary, that the
compounds which prolong the bioavailability of a nucleic acid have amphipathic
properties; that is, have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. The hydrophilic
region of the compounds may associate with the largely ionic and hydrophilic
regions of the nucleic acid, while the hydrophobic region of the compounds may
act to retard diffusion of nucleic acid and to protect nucleic acid from nucleases.
Additionally, the hydrophobic region may specifically interact with cell membranes,
possibly facilitating endocytosis of the compound and thereby nucleic acid
associated with the compound. This process may increase the pericellular
concentration of nucleic acid. Agents which may have amphipathic properties and
are generally regarded as being pharmaceutically acceptable are the following:
methylcelluloses, hydroxypropylcelluloses, hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses;
heteropolysaccharides (pectins); poloxamers (pluronics); poloxamines (tetronics); 
ethylene vinyl acetates; polyethylene glycols; polyvinylpyrrolidones; chitosans;
polyvinylalcohols; polyvinylacetates; phosphatidylcholines (lecithins); propylene
glycol; miglyols; polylactic acid; polyhydroxybutyric acid; xanthan gum. Also,
copolymer systems such as polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid (PEG-PLA),
polyethylene glycol-polyhydroxybutyric acid (PEG-PHB),
polyvinylpyrrolidone-polyvinylalcohol (PVP-PVA), and derivatized copolymers such
as copolymers of n-vinyl purine (or pyrimidine) derivatives and n-vinylpyrrolidone.
Nucleic acids may be loaded into biodegradable hydrogels such as crosslinked
polysaccharides, and PEG based gels by placing swellable hydrogel systems in
nucleic acid or complex solutions. Swellable hydrogels include but are not limited
to crosslinked oxidized arabinogalactan and dextran with a polyamine ;
calcium-crosslinked alginate, poloxamines (tetronics) and poloxamers (pluronics).</p>

ethanol:water mixtures, dimethylsulfoxide and other solvents and mixtures that
dissolve the unwanted molecules without dissolving or affecting the
polysaccharide. Another procedure for purification of the desired polysaccharide,
either after oxidation or after conjugation of the oligoamine, or after reduction with
sodium borohydride, is by precipitation in a water miscible anti-solvent that
dissolves the low molecular weight molecules (i.e unreacted reagent or reaction
by-producgts) but precipitate the polymer. Usually, for an efficient purification the
reaction solution is concentrated to minimize the amount of anti-solvent needed for
effective precipitation. Suitable solvents include ethanol, propanols, and butanols.
Oxidizing agents may include sodium periodate, osmium tetraoxide,
permanganate, chromates and the like. Reducing agents such as sodium
cyanoborohydride and borane-amine complexes can be used.</p>

Spermine and Spermidine, and more synthetic oligoamines, i.e. polyethyleneimine
and various diamines with different lengths. Although, most of these conjugates
formed stable complexes with various plasmids as determined by turbidity
experiments (data not shown), <u style="single">only</u> certain polycations based on
Dextran-Spermine conjugates were found to be active in transfecting cells.</p>
    <p num="0111">The optimal conditions for the preparation of active Dextran-Spermine conjugates
were as the follows: <ul list-style="bullet"><li>1:1 mole ratio between aldehydes and Spermine.</li><li>Initial high basic conditions (pH=11).</li><li>Slow addition of the polyaldehyde to Spermine.</li><li>Sufficient reduction with sodium borohydride.</li></ul></p>
    <p num="0112">Under these conditions, extensive aminolysis of glycoside linkages occurred
resulting in drastic chain session and low yields (25-30%).</p>
    <p num="0113">All polycations were mainly characterized by nitrogen elemental analysis, free
amino functionality (TNBS) and molecular weight. Table 2 summarizes a
representative group of conjugates (Dextran-Spermine) separately prepared using
identical conditions. Nitrogen content of these polycations showed near values in
the range of 9.7-12.77. Free amino contents of conjugates were also determined
(TNBS method) and found to be in the range of 0.9-1.515 Âµmol free amine per mg
conjugate. Average molecular weights of conjugates were determined by GPC
using 3% acetonitril (Acn) in 5% sodium phosphate (pH=4.0) as eluent. The
existence of phosphate ions in the mobile phase was found to be important to
prevent undesirable interaction between polycations and column resin. All
calculated molecular weights were in the region of 6-13 Kd and below the Mw of

in transfection. Hydrophobization of cationic polymers are believed to enhance
cell-membrane penetration (indocytosis) and therefore increase in transfection
efficacy. In literature, a unique fusogenic group was found to enhance cell
penetration of complexes. This group contains two oleate moities (T-shape)
connected to the polycation backbone. With the agreement of these findings, we
decided to attach our polycations with various fusogenic moities and to investigate 
their influence on transfection efficacies.</p>

active ester derivative of Chol was prepared starting from the commercial
Cholesteryl chloroformate and reaction with N-Hydroxy succinimide (NHS) in the

extreme reactive derivative and may reacts with primary and secondary amines or
even hydroxyl groups yielding a mixture of products. In the contrary, NHS-Chol
derivative (Scheme 1) are considered to be a moderate active ester and reacts
predominantly with primary amines.

    <p num="0141">The attachment of hydrophobic or amphiphilic residues can be carried-out by
various methods adopted from the literature (for example, Y.Takakura, et al.
Control of pharmaceutical properties of soybean tyrosine inhibitor by conjugation
with dextran I: synthesis and characterization, J. Pharm. Sci. 78, 117-121, 1989;
G.H. Hermanson, Bioconjugate techniques, Academic Press, 1996). The following
methods were used by the present inventor.</p>
    <p num="0142">The hydrophobic residue was generally conjugated by an ester, amide, imine,
amine, urethane or carbonate bonds depending on the availability of the functional
groups on the conjugated component. For example, fatty acids such as hexanoic
acid or oleic acid are bound to hydroxyl or amine groups on the polymer carrier
using activated acids such as anhydride or acid chloride derivatives or activating
agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and its derivatives that are more
suitable for aqueous mediums. Alternatively, hexyl or oleyl alcohols or amines
have been conjugated via carbonate or urethane bonds using phosgene
derivatives. Polyethylene glycol oligomers and derivatives were conjugated either
directly via the hydroxyl end or by converting the hydroxyl end group to a
carboxylic acid (by reacting the alcohol with succinic, glutaric or maleic anhydride)
or to a reactive epoxide group (by reacting with epichlorhydrine). The grafting
reactions are conducted in hydrophilic solutions where the polymer carrier is
soluble in or at least dispersed in fine particles with large surface area. Typical
mediums are dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methyl pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) and their mixtures with water.</p>
    <p num="0143">The amount of grafting suitable for cell penetration and transfection is in the range
of 1 to 10% of the repeated units building the polymer carrier, i.e. saccharide units.
This amount is dependent on the nature of the attached group, the nature of the
final product and the polymer carrier.</p>
    <p num="0144">In a typical experiment Triton-X100 (7g, 10 mmol) was dried by azeotropic
distillation with toluene. After solvent evaporation, SnCl4 (5 ?l) and epichlorhydrin
(1.4g, 15 mmol) and the mixture was kept at 100oC overnight. The solvent was 
evaporated and mixed with ether and extracted with cold 1N NaOH. The etheric
layer was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness to yield the epoxy
terminated Triton (70% yield). The product was identified by TLC (silica,
toluene:chloroform) and by H NMR (aromatic protons 5.9-6.7 ppm).</p>
    <p num="0145">Alternatively, dry Triton-X100 was reacted with succinic anhydride (1:1.1 mole
ratio) in toluene at reflux overnight to yield the corresponding succinate derivative
as determined by H-NMR, IR and titration.</p>
    <p num="0146">The chloroformate derivative of Triton was prepared from the reaction of the
hydroxyl terminal with diphosgene using known procedures. Grafting of these
functionalized Triton was conducted in DMF or DMF:water solutions under the
proper conditions. For example, epoxide terminated Triton (0.5g) was reacted with
dextran (2g) in 1N NaOH (10 ml) overnight at room temperature. The polymer was
purified by dialysis against water and lyophilization. The derivatization rate was
about 5% of the saccharide groups.</p>
    <p num="0147">Carboxylic acid Triton-X100 reacted with arabinogalactan in a mixture of DMF and
water using water soluble DCC. Chloroformate Triton was reacted with a
suspension of polysaccharides in dry DMF for 3 days at room temperature. Triton
was reacted in access relative to the saccharide groups in order to obtain a 5%
conjugation.</p>
    <p num="0148">Similar procedures were applied for the conjugation of methoxy-PEG-OH or
Lipo-PEG (a diblock polymer of a fatty acid such as stearyl, oleyl or hexanoyl
groups with (PEG)<sub>10-100</sub>).</p>
    <p num="0149">The conjugation of highly hydrophobic residues such as fatty acids and cholesterol
to hydrophilic polysaccharides was conducted in an organic solvent such as DMF
or DMSO, the conjugation yield was low (1-5% of saccharide units) but suitable for
gene formulation.</p>
    <p num="0150">Hydrophobic or amphiphilic residues were conjugated to oxidized polysaccharide
via an amine or imine bonds. In this cases, the hydroxyl terminal of Triton and
PEG derivatives were converted to amino terminals by esterification with glycine or 
alanine or by replacing the hydroxyl group with an amine using the
tosylate/ammonia procedure as described below for the amination of
polysaccharides.</p>
    <p num="0151">The amine terminated PEG derivatives, cholesteryl amine or fatty amines are
reacted with oxidized polysaccharides in basic buffer solutions (pH9-11) or
mixtures of DMF with water over night, similar to the procedures used for the
grafting of spermine. The grafting can be conducted during the conjugation of the
oligoamines by adding both the oligoamine and the amphiphilic derivative to the
reaction mixture. The imine derivatives were hydrogenated to the corresponding
amine bond using NaBH4 in water for 24 hours at room temperature.</p>

polymers</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0152">The purpose of this experiment was to show that hydrophobization improves
significantly the transfection yield.

Ten batches of spermine-dextran conjugates of molecular weights between 15,000
and 25,000, nitrogen content between 7-11% w/w and various branching degrees
(20 to 60% branching) were conjugated with oleic acid at a 20% of the free amino
side chains of the conjugated spermine. The conjugation procedure was as
described above. Five of these polymers showed a high transfection activity while
the other 5 showed a medium or low transfection efficiencies.

In this study, dextran-spermidine (3 amino groups) was derivatized with 20% oleic
acid using the above procedure,
Another experiment was conducted to determine the effect of crosslinking on the
trasnfection efficacy. The reaction between oxidized dextran and spermine was
conducted at concentrated solutions which increases crosslinking. Insoluble
crosslinked polymer particles of 1 to about 100 microns which were used for
transfection studies.

Transfection studies using the methods described below show a significant
increase in the transfection efficiency for all polymers which was higher or
comparable to the effficacy obtained with DOTAP/Cholesterol lipid system. The
crosslinking decreased the efficacy compared to the branched polymers usually
obtained. </p>

    <p num="0176">The polycations described in this application were used for a range of applications
as follows:
<sl><li>i. Complexation with heparin

Aqueous solutions of Heparin and arabinogalactan-spermine were mixed at a 1:1 
cation to anion ratio for a few hours at room temperature. The formed complex was
lyophilized to form a white powder which when dispersed in water very little free
heparin was found in the solution. This system can be used for control
concentration of heparins in aqueous solutions both in vitro and in vivo.</li><li>ii. Combination with hyaluronic acid

Aqueous solutions of hyaluronic acid (MW=2 million daltons, 1% solution) and
arabinogalactan-spermine (MW=20,000, 5%) were mixed at a 10:1 and 1:1 anion
to cation ratio for a few hours at room temperature. A significant increase in the
viscosity of hyaluronic acid was obtained which was used for the injection of
condors cells in mice for cell growth and cartilage formation. The 1:1 mixture
became more viscous than the 10% mixture. Alternatively, the formed complex was
lyophilized to form a white porous matrix which when dispersed in a medium
containing condors cells, the matrix particles swelled and allowed the cell ingrowth
into the swollen matrix.

Other anionic polymers such as alginic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose and a 1:1
copolymer of acrylic acid and methyl methacrylate (Eugragit) formed an
electrostatic complex with the spermine-dextran or arabinogalactan conjugates.</li><li>iii. Scaffolds for cell growth were prepared by conjugating a concentrated solutions
of spermine and oxidized arabinogalactan at a amine:aldehyde ratio of 1:20,
1:10 and 1:5 at room temperature. After 24 hours of mixing the resulting
compound was freeze dried to form a white porous matrix suitable for cell
growth for tissue engineering purposes.</li><li>iv. Non-medical applications for these polycations was found in the design of
electronic circuits based on repeated alternating coating of monolayers of
cationic polymers and anionic polymers. The polycations of this invention are
used in other applications in electro-optics and conducting polymers where
cationic polymers are used.

A different application is the use of the cationic polymer as semi-natural
conditioner which is composed of a polycation polymer. The high water
solubility, the safety and easy to make makes this class of polycations ideal for
cosmetic and toiletry applications.

These polycations can replace polycations that are used in the printing industry,

      <b>In-vitro degradation of spermine-dextran</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0180">Experimental: spermine-dextran polymers were weighted and incubated in
phosphate buffer 0.1 M, pH=7.4 at 37Â°C. At fixed time points the molecular weight
of the polymers was determined by GPC and by viscosity measurements. The
extent of degradation was determined as the percentage of the molecular weight
loss over time.

Results: There is a slow degradation of the polymers in aqueous solution in-vitro.
After 4 weeks in buffer solution the polymers decreased in molecular weight by
about 40% with the 20% oleate derivatives degraded the least. </p>

      <b>In-vivo implantation and histological observation of chitosan-AG gels in
BALB/c mice:</b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0181">Experimental: Scaffolds of crosslinked spermine-dextran and OxycellÂ® (as a
reference compound) were implanted sub-cutaneously in the back of BALB/c mice.

The scaffolds at size of 5x5mm were sterilized by U.V., and soaked in sterile saline
solution prior to implantation. After 3 days, 1 and 4 weeks the mice were sacrificed
and the scaffolds were explanted without loss from the mice together with the
surrounding tissue. Following fixation with 10% formalin the gels were sectioned
and stained with haematoxylin-eosin.

Results: The scaffolds cause local reaction at the surrounding tissue as can be
seen after 3 days and one week, however this reaction disappear after one month,
and can no longer be seen at the surrounding tissue. After one month a significant
amount of the polymer was degraded and eliminated from the implantation site.</p>
