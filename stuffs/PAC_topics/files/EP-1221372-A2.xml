    <p>An inkjet printhead assembly (12) includes at least one inkjet printhead
(40) having nozzles (13) and firing resisters (48). The inkjet printhead assembly
includes fire pulse generator circuitry (100/200) responsive to a start fire signal
to generate fire signals, each having a series of fire pulses. The fire pulse
generator circuitry generates the fire signals by controlling the initiation and
duration of the fire pulses. The fire pulses control timing and activation of
electrical current through the firing resisters to thereby control ejection of ink
drops from the nozzles. One embodiment of the inkjet printhead assembly
includes multiple printheads disposed on a carrier (30) to form a wide-array
inkjet printhead assembly.

PRINTHEAD ASSEMBLY" filed on January 5, 2001, with Attorney Docket
No. 10002118-1, which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>

        <u style="single">The Field of the Invention</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0002">The present invention relates generally to inkjet printheads, and more
particularly to generation of fire signals for controlling ejection of ink drops
from printheads.</p>
    <heading>
      <b>
        <u style="single">Background of the Invention</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0003">A conventional inkjet printing system includes a printhead, an ink supply
which supplies liquid ink to the printhead, and an electronic controller which
controls the printhead. The printhead ejects ink drops through a plurality of
orifices or nozzles and toward a print medium, such as a sheet of paper, so as to
print onto the print medium. Typically, the orifices are arranged in one or more
arrays such that properly sequenced ejection of ink from the orifices causes
characters or other images to be printed upon the print medium as the printhead
and the print medium are moved relative to each other.</p>
    <p num="0004">Typically, the printhead ejects the ink drops through the nozzles by
rapidly heating a small volume of ink located in vaporization chambers with
small electric heaters, such as thin film resisters. Heating the ink causes the ink
to vaporize and be ejected from the nozzles. Typically, for one dot of ink, a
remote printhead controller typically located as part of the processing electronics
of a printer, controls the timing and activation of an electrical current from a
power supply external to the printhead with a fire pulse. The electrical current is 
passed through a selected thin film resister to heat the ink in a corresponding
selected vaporization chamber.</p>
    <p num="0005">In one type of inkjet printing system, printheads receive fire signals
containing fire pulses from the electronic controller. In one arrangement, the fire
signal is fed directly to the nozzles in the printhead. In another arrangement, the
fire signal is latched in the printhead, and the latched version of the fire signal is
fed to the nozzles to control the ejection of ink drops from the nozzles.</p>
    <p num="0006">In either of the above two arrangements, the electronic controller of the
printer maintains control of all timing related to the fire signal. The timing
related to the fire signal primarily refers to the actual width of the fire pulse and
the point in time at which the fire pulse occurs. The electronic controller
controlling the timing related to the fire signal works well for printheads capable
of printing only a single column at a time, because such printheads only need
one fire signal to the printhead to control the ejection of ink drops from the
printhead.</p>
    <p num="0007">One proposed printhead has the capability of printing multiple columns
of the same color or multiple columns of different colors simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="0008">In one arrangement, commonly referred to as a wide-array inkjet printing
system, a plurality of individual printheads, also referred to as printhead dies, are
mounted on a single carrier. In one proposed arrangement, a wide-array inkjet
printing system includes printheads which have the capability of printing
multiple columns of the same color or multiple columns of different colors
simultaneously. In any of these arrangements, a number of nozzles and,
therefore, an overall number of ink drops which can be ejected per second is
increased. Since the overall number of drops which can be ejected per second is
increased, printing speed can be increased with a wide-array inkjet printing
system and/or printheads having the capability of printing multiple columns
simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="0009">The energy requirements of different printheads and/or different print
columns can possibly require a different fire pulse width for each printhead
and/or print column due to processing/manufacturing variability. In this case, 
the number of fire signals necessary for the inkjet printing system increases
significantly. For example, a 4-color integrated printhead requires four fire
signals in order to independently control each color. If six of the example 4-color
integrated printheads are disposed on a single carrier to form a print bar
array in a wide-array inkjet printing system, the number of required fire signals
increases to 24.</p>
    <p num="0010">For reasons stated above and for other reasons presented in greater detail
in the Description of the Preferred Embodiment section of the present
specification, a wide-array inkjet printing system and/or a printhead having the
capability of printing multiple columns is desired which minimizes the number
of fire signals provided from the electronic controller to the printhead(s).</p>

        <u style="single">Summary of the Invention</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0011">One aspect of the present invention provides an inkjet printhead
including nozzles, firing resisters, and fire pulse generator circuitry. The fire
pulse generator circuitry is responsive to a start fire signal to generate a plurality
of fire signals. Each fire signal has a series of fire pulses, and the fire pulse
generator circuitry generates the fire signals by controlling the initiation and
duration of the fire pulses. The fire pulses control timing and activation of
electrical current through the firing resisters to thereby control ejection of ink
drops from the nozzles.</p>
    <p num="0012">In one embodiment, the fire pulse generator circuitry includes counters.
Each counter is responsive to the initiation of a corresponding fire pulse to count
to a corresponding count value representing the duration of the corresponding
fire pulse. In one embodiment, the fire pulse generator circuitry further includes
pulse width registers for holding pulse width values. The counters are each
preloaded with a corresponding pulse width value and respond to the initiation of
the corresponding fire pulse to count down from the corresponding pulse width
value to determine the duration of the corresponding fire pulse. In one
embodiment, the fire pulse generator circuitry includes controllers controlling
corresponding counters. Each controller provides a corresponding fire pulse and 
activates a start signal to the corresponding counter to initiate the count. Each
counter activates a stop signal to the corresponding controller to terminate the
corresponding fire pulse when the count value is reached.</p>
    <p num="0013">In one embodiment, the fire pulse generator circuitry includes a start fire
detection circuit receiving the start fire signal and verifying that a valid active
start fire signal is received. In one embodiment, the start fire detection circuit
receives a clock signal having active transitions and verifies that the valid active
start fire signal is received by requiring that the active start fire signal is present
for at least two of the active transitions of the clock signal.</p>
    <p num="0014">In one embodiment, an active start fire signal is provided to the fire
pulse generator circuitry each time a fire pulse is generated. In another
embodiment, an active start fire signal is provided to the fire pulse generator
circuitry only at the beginning of a print swath.</p>
    <p num="0015">In one embodiment, the fire pulse generator circuitry also controls dead-time
between fire pulses in the series of fire pulses in each fire signal. In one
embodiment, the fire pulse generator circuitry includes dead-time counters.
Each dead-time counter is responsive to a termination of a corresponding fire
pulse to count to a corresponding dead-time count value representing the
duration of the dead-time between fire pulses. In one embodiment, the fire pulse
generator circuitry further includes dead-time registers for holding dead-time
values. The dead-time counters are each preloaded with a corresponding dead-time
value and respond to the termination of the corresponding fire pulse to
count down from the corresponding dead-time value to determine the dead-time
between fire pulses.</p>
    <p num="0016">One aspect of the present invention provides an inkjet printhead
assembly including at least one printhead. Each printhead includes nozzles and
firing resisters. The inkjet printhead assembly includes fire pulse generator
circuitry responsive to a first start fire signal to generate a plurality of fire
signals. Each fire signal has a series of fire pulses, and the fire pulse generator
circuitry generates the fire signals by controlling the initiation and duration of
the fire pulses. The fire pulses control timing and activation of electrical current 
through the firing resisters to thereby control ejection of ink drops from the
nozzles.</p>
    <p num="0017">In one embodiment, the first start fire signal is provided from a printer
controller located external from the inkjet printhead assembly. In one
embodiment, the inkjet printhead assembly includes a carrier, N printheads
disposed on the carrier, and a module manager disposed on the carrier. In one
embodiment, the module manager receives a second start fire signal from a
printer controller located external from the inkjet printhead assembly and
provides the first start fire signal representing the first start signal to each of the
N printheads.</p>
    <p num="0018">One aspect of the present invention provides an inkjet printhead
assembly including, a carrier, N printheads disposed on the carrier, and a module
manager disposed on the carrier. Each printhead includes nozzles and firing
resisters. The module manager includes fire pulse generator circuitry responsive
to a start fire signal to generate a plurality of fire signals. Each fire signal has a
series of fire pulses, and the fire pulse generator circuitry generates the fire
signals by controlling the initiation and duration of the fire pulses. The fire
pulses control timing and activation of electrical current through the firing
resisters to thereby control ejection of ink drops from the nozzles of the
printheads.</p>
    <p num="0019">One aspect of the present invention provides an inkjet printing system
including a printer controller providing a start fire signal. The inkjet printing
system includes an inkjet printhead assembly having at least one printhead and
fire pulse generator circuitry. Each printhead includes nozzles and firing
resisters. The fire pulse generator circuitry is responsive to the start fire signal to
generate a plurality of fire signals. Each fire signal has a series of fire pulses,
and the fire pulse generator circuitry generates the fire signals by controlling the
initiation and duration of the fire pulses. The fire pulses control timing and
activation of electrical current through the firing resisters to thereby control
ejection of ink drops from the nozzles. </p>
    <p num="0020">One aspect of the present invention provides a method of inkjet printing
including receiving a start fire signal at a printhead assembly, which includes at
least one printhead having nozzles and firing resisters. The method includes
generating, in response to the start fire signal, a plurality of fire signals, each
having a series of fire pulses, by controlling the initiation and duration of the fire
pulses internal to the printhead assembly. The method includes controlling
timing and activation of electrical current through the firing resisters to thereby
control ejection of ink drops from the nozzles based on the fire pulses.</p>
    <p num="0021">An inkjet printhead/printhead assembly according to the present
invention can provide different fire pulse widths for different printheads and/or
print columns to accommodate the energy requirements of different printheads
and/or different print columns resulting from processing/manufacturing
variability without increasing the number of fire signals from the printer
controller to the printhead/printhead assembly. One embodiment of the fire
pulse generator circuitry according to the present invention only requires one
start fire conductor between the printer controller and the printhead/printhead
assembly.</p>
    <p num="0022">Thus, the printhead/printhead assembly containing fire pulse generator
circuitry according to the present invention can significantly reduce the
following: the number of fire signal conductive paths to and from the
printhead/printhead assembly; the number of drivers in the electronic controller
necessary to transmit the fire signals from the electronic controller to the
printhead assembly; and the number of pads required on the printhead/printhead
assembly to receive the fire signals. Furthermore, in one embodiment having
multiple printheads disposed on a carrier to form a printhead assembly and
having the fire pulse generator circuitry internal to the printheads, the wiring
complexity of the carrier is reduced.</p>

      </b>
    </heading>
    <p num="0024">In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments,
reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and
in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the
invention may be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as
"top," "bottom," "front," "back," "leading," "trailing," etc., is used with
reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described. The inkjet
printhead assembly and related components of the present invention can be
positioned in a number of different orientations. As such, the directional
terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to
be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical
changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting
sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims. </p>
    <p num="0025">Figure 1 illustrates one embodiment of an inkjet printing system 10
according to the present invention. Inkjet printing system 10 includes an inkjet
printhead assembly 12, an ink supply assembly 14, a mounting assembly 16, a
media transport assembly 18, and an electronic controller 20. At least one power
supply 22 provides power to the various electrical components of inkjet printing
system 10. Inkjet printhead assembly 12 includes at least one printhead or
printhead die 40 which ejects drops of ink through a plurality of orifices or
nozzles 13 and toward a print medium 19 so as to print onto print medium 19.
Print medium 19 is any type of suitable sheet material, such as paper, card stock,
transparencies, Mylar, and the like. Typically, nozzles 13 are arranged in one or
more columns or arrays such that properly sequenced ejection of ink from
nozzles 13 causes characters, symbols, and/or other graphics or images to be
printed upon print medium 19 as inkjet printhead assembly 12 and print medium
19 are moved relative to each other.</p>
    <p num="0026">Ink supply assembly 14 supplies ink to printhead assembly 12 and
includes a reservoir 15 for storing ink. As such, ink flows from reservoir 15 to
inkjet printhead assembly 12. Ink supply assembly 14 and inkjet printhead
assembly 12 can form either a one-way ink delivery system or a recirculating ink
delivery system. In a one-way ink delivery system, substantially all of the ink
supplied to inkjet printhead assembly 12 is consumed during printing. In a
recirculating ink delivery system, however, only a portion of the ink supplied to
printhead assembly 12 is consumed during printing. As such, ink not consumed
during printing is returned to ink supply assembly 14.</p>
    <p num="0027">In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 12 and ink supply
assembly 14 are housed together in an inkjet cartridge or pen. In another
embodiment, ink supply assembly 14 is separate from inkjet printhead assembly
12 and supplies ink to inkjet printhead assembly 12 through an interface
connection, such as a supply tube. In either embodiment, reservoir 15 of ink
supply assembly 14 may be removed, replaced, and/or refilled. In one
embodiment, where inkjet printhead assembly 12 and ink supply assembly 14
are housed together in an inkjet cartridge, reservoir 15 includes a local reservoir 
located within the cartridge as well as a larger reservoir located separately from
the cartridge. As such, the separate, larger reservoir serves to refill the local
reservoir. Accordingly, the separate, larger reservoir and/or the local reservoir
may be removed, replaced, and/or refilled.</p>
    <p num="0028">Mounting assembly 16 positions inkjet printhead assembly 12 relative to
media transport assembly 18 and media transport assembly 18 positions print
medium 19 relative to inkjet printhead assembly 12. Thus, a print zone 17 is
defined adjacent to nozzles 13 in an area between inkjet printhead assembly 12
and print medium 19. In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 12 is a
scanning type printhead assembly. As such, mounting assembly 16 includes a
carriage for moving inkjet printhead assembly 12 relative to media transport
assembly 18 to scan print medium 19. In another embodiment, inkjet printhead
assembly 12 is a non-scanning type printhead assembly. As such, mounting
assembly 16 fixes inkjet printhead assembly 12 at a prescribed position relative
to media transport assembly 18. Thus, media transport assembly 18 positions
print medium 19 relative to inkjet printhead assembly 12.</p>
    <p num="0029">Electronic controller or printer controller 20 typically includes a
processor, firmware, and other printer electronics for communicating with and
controlling inkjet printhead assembly 12, mounting assembly 16, and media
transport assembly 18. Electronic controller 20 receives data 21 from a host
system, such as a computer, and includes memory for temporarily storing data
21. Typically, data 21 is sent to inkjet printing system 10 along an electronic,
infrared, optical, or other information transfer path. Data 21 represents, for
example, a document and/or file to be printed. As such, data 21 forms a print job
for inkjet printing system 10 and includes one or more print job commands
and/or command parameters.</p>
    <p num="0030">In one embodiment, logic and drive circuitry are incorporated in a
module manager integrated circuit (IC) 50 located on inkjet printhead assembly
12. Module manger IC 50 is similar to the module manager IC discussed in the
above incorporated parent patent application entitled "MODULE MANAGER
FOR WIDE-ARRAY INKJET PRINTHEAD ASSEMBLY." Electronic 
controller 20 and module manager IC 50 operate together to control inkjet
printhead assembly 12 for ejection of ink drops from nozzles 13. As such,
electronic controller 20 and module manager IC 50 define a pattern of ejected
ink drops which form characters, symbols, and/or other graphics or images on
print medium 19. The pattern of ejected ink drops, is determined by the print job
commands and/or command parameters.</p>
    <p num="0031">In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly 12 is a wide-array or
multi-head printhead assembly. In one embodiment, inkjet printhead assembly
12 includes a carrier 30, which carries printhead dies 40 and module manager IC
50. In one embodiment carrier 30 provides electrical communication between
printhead dies 40, module manager IC 50, and electronic controller 20, and
fluidic communication between printhead dies 40 and ink supply assembly 14.</p>
    <p num="0032">In one embodiment, printhead dies 40 are spaced apart and staggered
such that printhead dies 40 in one row overlap at least one printhead die 40 in
another row. Thus, inkjet printhead assembly 12 may span a nominal page width
or a width shorter or longer than nominal page width. In one embodiment, a
plurality of inkjet printhead sub-assemblies or modules 12' (illustrated in Figure
2) form one inkjet printhead assembly 12. The inkjet printhead modules 12' are
substantially similar to the above described printhead assembly 12 and each have
a carrier 30 which carries a plurality of printhead dies 40 and a module manager
IC 50. In one embodiment, the printhead assembly 12 is formed of multiple
inkjet printhead modules 12' which are mounted in an end-to-end manner and
each carrier 30 has a staggered or stair-step profile. As a result, at least one
printhead die 40 of one inkjet printhead module 12' overlaps at least one
printhead die 40 of an adjacent inkjet printhead module 12'.</p>
    <p num="0033">A portion of one embodiment of a printhead die 40 is illustrated
schematically in Figure 3. Printhead die 40 includes an array of printing or drop
ejecting elements 42. Printing elements 42 are formed on a substrate 44 which
has an ink feed slot 441 formed therein. As such, ink feed slot 441 provides a
supply of liquid ink to printing elements 42. Each printing element 42 includes a
thin-film structure 46, an orifice layer 47, and a firing resistor 48. Thin-film 
structure 46 has an ink feed channel 461 formed therein which communicates
with ink feed slot 441 of substrate 44. Orifice layer 47 has a front face 471 and a
nozzle opening 472 formed in front face 471. Orifice layer 47 also has a nozzle
chamber 473 formed therein which communicates with nozzle opening 472 and
ink feed channel 461 of thin-film structure 46. Firing resistor 48 is positioned
within nozzle chamber 473 and includes leads 481 which electrically couple
firing resistor 48 to a drive signal and ground.</p>
    <p num="0034">During printing, ink flows from ink feed slot 441 to nozzle chamber 473
via ink feed channel 461. Nozzle opening 472 is operatively associated with
firing resistor 48 such that droplets of ink within nozzle chamber 473 are ejected
through nozzle opening 472 (e.g., normal to the plane of firing resistor 48) and
toward a print medium upon energization of firing resistor 48.</p>
    <p num="0035">Example embodiments of printhead dies 40 include a thermal printhead,
a piezoelectric printhead, a flex-tensional printhead, or any other type of inkjet
ejection device known in the art. In one embodiment, printhead dies 40 are fully
integrated thermal inkjet printheads. As such, substrate 44 is formed, for
example, of silicon, glass, or a stable polymer and thin-film structure 46 is
formed by one or more passivation or insulation layers of silicon dioxide, silicon
carbide, silicon nitride, tantalum, poly-silicon glass, or other suitable material.
Thin-film structure 46 also includes a conductive layer which defines firing
resistor 48 and leads 481. The conductive layer is formed, for example, by
aluminum, gold, tantalum, tantalum-aluminum, or other metal or metal alloy.</p>
    <p num="0036">In one embodiment, at least one printhead 40 of printhead assembly 12 is
implemented as a printhead having the capability of printing multiple columns of
the same color or multiple columns of different colors simultaneously.</p>
    <p num="0037">Printhead assembly 12 can include any suitable number (N) of printheads
40, where N is at least one. Before a print operation can be performed, data must
be sent to printhead 40. Data includes, for example, print data and non-print data
for printhead 40. Print data includes, for example, nozzle data containing pixel
information, such as bitmap print data. Non-print data includes, for example,
command/status (CS) data, clock data, and/or synchronization data. Status data 
of CS data includes, for example, printhead temperature or position, printhead
resolution, and/or error notification.</p>
    <p num="0038">A portion of one embodiment of a printhead 40 is illustrated generally in
Figure 4 in block diagram form. As discussed in the Background of the
Invention section of the present specification, conventional inkjet printing
systems typically employ an electronic controller remote from the printhead to
control the timing and activation of an electrical current from a power supply
external to the printhead with a fire signal to thereby control the ejection of ink
drops from the printhead. In the conventional inkjet printing system, printheads
receive fire signals containing fire pulses from the electronic controller. By
contrast, printhead 40 generally illustrated in Figure 4, includes integrated
programmable fire pulse generators for generating fire signals containing fire
pulses for controlling ejection of ink drops from printhead 40.</p>
    <p num="0039">Fire pulse generator circuitry 100 includes a start_fire detection circuit
102 which receives a start_fire signal on a line 104 from electronic controller 20
or module manager IC 50. Start_fire detection circuit 102 also receives a clock
signal on line 106. Start_fire detection circuit 102 verifies when a valid active
start_fire signal is received on line 104. Start_fire detection circuit 102 prevents
a spurious transition on the start_fire signal on line 104 from causing a fire pulse
to be generated at an improper or undesired time.</p>
    <p num="0040">In one embodiment, start_fire detection circuit 102 verifies that a valid
active start_fire signal is received on line 104 by requiring that the active
start_fire signal on line 104 be present for two active transitions of the clock
signal on line 106 to be considered a valid active start_fire signal. There are,
however, many suitable validations methods which can be employed by
start_fire detection circuit 102 to verify that the start_fire signal on line 104
indicates a valid active start_fire signal.</p>
    <p num="0041">In response to the start_fire detection circuit 102 validating that the active
start_fire signal on line 104 is properly received, the start_fire detection circuit
102 activates a begin_pulse signal on a line 108. </p>
    <p num="0042">Fire pulse generator circuitry 100 includes N pulse width registers 110a,
110b,...,110n. Pulse width registers 110a-110n receive data on data_bus 112
and addresses from address_bus 114. The clock on line 106 is also provided to
pulse width registers 110a-110n. Pulse width registers 110a-110n store pulse
width values which are employed to determine the widths of the fire pulses
provided from fire pulse generator circuitry 100. Pulse width registers 110a-110n
respectively provide pulse counts 1,2,..., N on busses 116a, 116b,...,116n,
which represent the corresponding pulse width values stored in pulse width
registers 110a-110n. Each pulse width register 110a-110n stores an appropriate
number of bits in the pulse width value to properly encode the desired width of
the corresponding fire pulse from fire pulse generator circuitry 100.</p>
    <p num="0043">Fire pulse generator circuitry 100 includes N fire pulse generators 118a,
118b,...,118n corresponding to pulse width registers 110a-110n respectively.
Fire pulse generators 118a-118n all receive the begin_pulse signal on line 108
from start_fire detection circuit 102 and the clock signal on line 106. In
addition, fire pulse generators 118a-118n receive the pulse counts 1-N on busses
116a-116n respectively. Fire pulse generators 118a-118n respectively provide
the fire signals fire_pulse_1, fire_pulse_2,...,fire_pulse_N respectively on lines
120a, 120b,...,120n.</p>
    <p num="0044">In one embodiment, each fire pulse generator 118a-118n includes a
counter which is controlled by the corresponding pulse count signal on the
corresponding bus 116. In one example embodiment, fire pulse generators 118a-118n
respectively include binary countdown counters 122a, 122b,...,122n. In
this example embodiment, the respective binary countdown counter 122 is pre-loaded
with the pulse width value stored in the corresponding pulse width
register 110 and provided as the pulse count signal on the corresponding bus
116.</p>
    <p num="0045">In one embodiment, the pulse width value stored in each pulse width
register 110 is given by the following Equation I.

(Pulse Width Value) = (Desired Pulse Width) x (Clock Frequency)</st32:df></p>
    <p num="0046">Electronic controller 20 of inkjet printing system 10 can access pulse
width registers 110a-110n in the same manner that electronic controller 20
accesses the other registers in printhead 40 via data_bus 112 and address bus
114. Thus, no extra control circuitry is required to implement the pulse width
registers 110a-110n. In one embodiment, command data from electronic
controller 20 which is independent of nozzle data is provided to and status data
read from printhead 40 over a serial bi-directional non-print data serial bus 68.
In another embodiment, module manger IC 50 communicates with electronic
controller 20 over serial bi-directional non-print data serial bus 68, and module
manager IC 50 writes command data to and reads status data from priritheads 40
over serial bi-directional CS data line 78. In either embodiment, electronic
controller 20 can access pulse width registers 110a-110n via bi-directional non-print
data serial bus 68 which communicates serial data to and from data _bus
112 and address _bus 114.</p>
    <p num="0047">One embodiment of a fire pulse generator 118 is illustrated in block
diagram form in Figure 5. Fire pulse generator 118 includes binary countdown
counter 122 and a controller 124. Countdown counter 122 receives the pulse
count from bus 116 which provides the pulse width value from the
corresponding pulse width register 110 for preloading countdown counter 122.</p>
    <p num="0048">Controller 124 receives the begin_pulse signal on line 108 and the clock
signal on line 106. The clock signal on line 106 is also provided to countdown
counter 122. Controller 124 provides the fire_pulse signal on line 120.
Controller 124 also provides a start signal to countdown counter 122 on line 126.
Countdown counter 122 correspondingly provides a stop signal on a line 128 to
controller 124. The fire_pulse signal on line 120 is provided to control the
ejection of ink drops from nozzles of printhead 40.</p>
    <p num="0049">In one embodiment, controller 124 includes state machines which control
the generation of a properly timed fire_pulse signal on line 120. Controller 124
accepts the active begin_pulse signal from the start_fire detection circuit 102 and
accordingly initiates a fire_pulse on line 120. When controller 124 initiates the 
fire_pulse on line 120, controller 124 also activates the start signal on line 126 to
initiate a timing function of countdown counter 122 for timing the duration of
the fire_pulse on line 120. Controller 124 controls the preloading of countdown
counter 122 with the pulse count on bus 116, which represents the pulse width
value from pulse width register 110. Controller 124 terminates the fire_pulse on
line 120 in response to receiving an activated stop signal on line 128 from
countdown counter 122.</p>
    <p num="0050">Countdown counter 122 functions as a timing circuit to ensure that the
fire_pulse generated on line 120 by controller 124 is of a proper duration. One
embodiment of countdown counter 122 is a binary countdown counter which is
preloaded with the pulse width value from pulse width register 110. Upon
receipt of an activated start signal on line 126 from controller 124, countdown
counter 122 begins to countdown. In one example embodiment, when the count
value stored in countdown counter 122 reaches zero, countdown counter 122
activates the stop signal on line 128, and controller 124 correspondingly
responds to the activated stop signal to terminate the fire_pulse on line 120.</p>
    <p num="0051">In the above-described embodiments illustrated in Figures 4 and 5,
electronic controller 20 or module manager IC 50 is required to activate the
start_fire signal each time a corresponding fire_pulse is generated by the fire
pulse generators 118. Accordingly, in the above described embodiments,
electronic controller 20 and/or module manager 50 is required to maintain
control of when the fire_pulses actually occur.</p>
    <p num="0052">A portion of an alternative embodiment printhead 40' having alternative
embodiment fire_pulse generator circuitry 200 is illustrated in block diagram
form in Figure 6. Fire pulse generator circuitry 200 automatically generates
fire_pulses having the proper duration and also automatically generates the
proper dead time between fire pulses in a series of fire pulses in each fire signal.</p>
    <p num="0053">Fire pulse generator circuitry 200 includes a start_fire detection circuit
202 receiving a start_fire signal on a line 204 and a clock signal on a line 206.
Start_fire detection circuit 202 functions substantially similar to the start_fire
detection circuit 102 of fire pulse generator circuitry 100 and accordingly 
activates a begin_pulse signal on a line 208 after verifying that a valid active
start_fire signal on line 204 has been provided from electronic controller 20 or
module manager IC 50. However, the start_fire signal on line 204 need only be
activated by electronic controller 20 or module manager IC 50 at the beginning
of a print swath rather than maintaining control of when each of the fire_pulses
actually occur. Thus, the begin_pulse signal is also only activated in response to
a valid activated start_fire signal at the beginning of a print swath.</p>
    <p num="0054">Fire pulse generator circuitry 200 includes pulse width registers 210a-210n
receiving data on data_bus 212, addresses on address_bus 214, and the
clock on line 206. The pulse width registers 210a-210n hold pulse width values
corresponding to the desired pulse widths of the fire_pulses generated by fire
pulse generator circuitry 200. The pulse width registers 210a-210n function
substantially similar to the pulse width registers 110a-110n of fire pulse
generator circuitry 100 and accordingly provide pulse count signals 1-N on
corresponding busses 216a-216n, which represent the pulse width values.</p>
    <p num="0055">In addition to the pulse width registers 210a-210n, fire pulse generator
circuitry 200 includes N dead-time registers 230a, 230b,...,230n which also
receive data from data_bus 212, addresses from address_bus 214, and the clock
on line 206. The dead-time registers 230a-230n store N dead-time values which
represent proper dead times between fire_pulses. Dead-time registers 230a-230n
accordingly provide dead-time counts on busses 232a, 232b,...,230n, which
represent the dead-time values.</p>
    <p num="0056">Fire pulse generator circuitry 200 also includes fire pulse generators
218a, 218b,....218n. Fire pulse generators 218a-218n include corresponding
binary countdown counters 222a, 222b,...,222n, which are preloaded with the
pulse width values represented by the pulse counts provided from pulse width
registers 210a-210n on busses 216a-216n. Countdown counters 222a-222n are
substantially similar to countdown counters 122a-122n of fire pulse generators
118a-118n. Fire pulse generators 218a-218n also include corresponding dead-time
binary countdown counters 234a, 234b,...,234n. Dead-time countdown. 
counters 234a-234n are preloaded with the dead-time values from dead-time
registers 230a-230n provided as the dead-time counts on busses 232a-232n.</p>
    <p num="0057">Fire pulse generators 218a-218n each include a controller 224 which
functions similar to controller 124 of fire pulse generator 118 in controlling
countdown counters 222a-222n. However, controller 224 also controls the dead-time
countdown counters 234a-234n. Controller 224 accordingly provides the
proper width of the fire_pulses based on the timing function provided by
countdown counter 222. In addition, controller 224 provides the proper dead
time between fire_pulses based on the timing function provided by dead-time
countdown counter 234. In one embodiment, controller 224 includes state
machines which respond to countdown counter 222 and dead-time countdown
counter 234 to generate fire_pulses of proper duration with proper dead time
between fire pulses, which are provided as fire_pulse signals fire_pulse_1,
fire_pulse_2,..., fire_pulse_N on lines 220a, 220b,...,220n to control the
ejection of ink drops from the printhead nozzles.</p>
    <p num="0058">In each fire pulse generator 218, the dead-time countdown counter 234 is
reset by controller 224 at the end of each fire_pulse generated by the fire pulse
generator 218 and is initiated at this time to begin counting down from the
preloaded dead-time value provided from the corresponding dead-time register
230 to automatically generate the proper dead time between fire pulses. In this
way, fire pulse generator circuitry 200 maintains control of when the individual
fire pulses from fire pulse generators 218 actually occur, and fire pulse generator
circuitry 200 only needs to be initiated with a start_fire signal activation from
electronic controller 20 or module manager IC 50 at the beginning of a print
swath.</p>
    <p num="0059">A portion of one embodiment of an inkjet printhead assembly 12 is
illustrated generally in Figure 7. Inkjet printhead assembly 12 includes complex
analog and digital electronic components. Thus, inkjet printhead assembly 12
includes printhead power supplies for providing power to the electronic
components within printhead assembly 12. For example, a Vpp power supply 52
and corresponding power ground 54 supply power to the firing resisters in 
printheads 40. An example 5-volt analog power supply 56 and corresponding
analog ground 58 supply power to the analog electronic components in printhead
assembly 12. An example 5-volt logic supply 60 and a corresponding logic
ground 62 supply power to logic devices requiring a 5-volt logic power source.
A 3.3-volt logic power supply 64 and the logic ground 62 supply power to logic
components requiring a 3.3-volt logic power source, such as module manager
50. In one embodiment, module manager 50 is an application specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) requiring a 3.3-volt logic power source.</p>
    <p num="0060">In the example embodiment illustrated in Figure 7, printhead assembly
12 includes eight printheads 40. Printhead assembly 12 can include any suitable
number (N) of printheads. Before a print operation can be performed, data must
be sent to printheads 40. Data includes, for example, print data and non-print
data for printheads 40. Print data includes, for example, nozzle data containing
pixel information, such as bitmap print data. Non-print data includes, for
example, command/status (CS) data, clock data, and/or synchronization data.
Status data of CS data includes, for example, printhead temperature or position,
printhead resolution, and/or error notification.</p>
    <p num="0061">Module manager IC 50 according to the present invention receives data
from electronic controller 20 and provides both print data and non-print data to
the printheads 40. For each printing operation, electronic controller sends nozzle
data to module manager IC 50 on a print data line 66 in a serial format. The
nozzle data provided on print data line 66 may be divided into two or more
sections, such as even and odd nozzle data. In the example embodiment
illustrated in Figure 7, serial print data is received on print data line 66 which is
6 bits wide. The print data line 66 can be any suitable number of bits wide.</p>
    <p num="0062">Independent of nozzle data, command data from electronic controller 20
may be provided to and status data read from printhead assembly 12 over a serial
bi-directional non-print data serial bus 68.</p>
    <p num="0063">A clock signal from electronic controller 20 is provided to module
manager IC 50 on a clock line 70. A busy signal is provided from module
manager IC 50 to electronic controller 20 on a line 72. </p>
    <p num="0064">Module manager IC 50 receives the print data on line 66 and distributes
the print data to the appropriate printhead 40 via data line 74. In the example
embodiment illustrated in Figure 7, data line 74 is 32 bits wide to provide four
bits of serial data to each of the eight printheads 40. Data clock signals based on
the input clock received on line 70 are provided on clock line 76 to clock the
serial data from data line 74 into the printheads 40. In the example embodiment
illustrated in Figure 7, clock line 76 is eight bits wide to provide clock signals to
each of the eight printheads 40.</p>
    <p num="0065">Module manager IC 50 writes command data to and reads status data
from printheads 40 over serial bi-directional CS data line 78. A CS clock is
provided on CS clock line 80 to clock the CS data from CS data line 78 to
printheads 40 and to module manager 50.</p>
    <p num="0066">In the example embodiment of inkjet printhead assembly 12 illustrated in
Figure 7, the number of conductive paths in the print data interconnect between
electronic controller 20 and inkjet printhead assembly 12 is significantly
reduced, because an example module manager IC (e.g., ASIC) 50 is capable of
much faster data rates than data rates provided by current printheads. For one
example printhead design and example module manager ASIC 50 design, the
print data interconnect is reduced from 32 pins to six lines to achieve the same
printing speed, such as in the example embodiment of inkjet printhead assembly
12 illustrated in Figure 7. This reduction in the number of conductive paths in
the print data interconnect significantly reduces costs and improves reliability of
the printhead assembly and the printing system.</p>
    <p num="0067">In addition, module manager IC 50 can provide certain functions that can
be shared across all the printheads 40. In this embodiment, the printhead 40 can
be designed without certain functions, such as memory and/or processor
intensive functions, which are instead performed in module manager IC 50. In
addition, functions performed by module manager IC 50 are more easily updated
during testing, prototyping, and later product revisions than functions performed
in printheads 40. </p>
    <p num="0068">Moreover, certain functions typically performed by electronic controller
20 can be incorporated into module manager IC 50. For example, one
embodiment of module manager IC 50 monitors the relative status of the
multiple printheads 40 disposed on carrier 30, and controls the printheads 40
relative to each other, which otherwise could only be monitored/controlled
relative to each other off the carrier with the electronic controller 20.</p>
    <p num="0069">In one embodiment, module manager IC 50 permits standalone
printheads to operate in a multi-printhead printhead assembly 12 without
modification. A standalone printhead is a printhead which is capable of being
independently coupled directly to an electronic controller. One example
embodiment of printhead assembly 12 includes standalone printheads 40 which
are directly coupled to module manger IC 50.</p>
    <p num="0070">As illustrated in Figure 7, one embodiment of module manager IC 50
includes fire pulse generator circuitry, such as fire pulse generator circuitry 100
described above and illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 or fire pulse generator
circuitry 200 described above and illustrated in Figure 6. The fire pulse
generator circuitry in module manager IC 50 operates substantially similar to the
fire pulse generator circuitry in the printhead 40 illustrated in Figure 4 or the
printhead 40' illustrated in Figure 6, except that the fire_pulses are no longer
generated in the printheads 40, and therefore, need to be provided to the
printheads 40 on lines 320 (shown in Figure 7).</p>
    <p num="0071">Thus, fire pulse generator circuitry 100/200 receives the start _fire signal
on line 104/204 and verifies when a valid active start _fire signal is received.
Fire pulse generator circuitry 100/200 responds to the validated active start fire
signal to initiate fire _pulses on lines 320 of proper duration. In addition, as
described above, in the fire pulse generator circuitry 200 embodiment, the
dead_time between fire_pulses is also provided by fire pulse generator circuitry
200.</p>
    <p num="0072">In the printhead embodiments illustrated in Figures 4-6, the fire pulse
generator circuitry is contained within the printhead which enables the printhead
to automatically generate fire pulses of proper duration. In the embodiment 
illustrated in Figure 7, the printhead assembly 12 via module manager IC 50
automatically generates the fire pulses of proper duration. In any of these
embodiments, electronic controller 20 of inkjet printing system 10 according to
the present invention does not need to generate the individual fire pulses. In
addition, in the alternative embodiment of fire pulse generator circuitry 200
illustrated in Figure 6, the proper dead time between fire pulses is generated in
the printhead 40 or module manager IC 50 so that electronic controller 20 of the
inkjet printing system according to the present invention does not need to
maintain control of when the fire pulses actually occur.</p>
    <p num="0073">As discussed in the Background of the Invention section, the energy
requirements of different printheads and/or different print columns can possibly
require a different fire pulse width for each printhead and/or print column due to
processing/manufacturing variability. In this case, the number of fire signals
necessary for the inkjet printing system increases significantly. In such a
system, the fire pulse generator circuitry according to the present invention, such
as fire pulse generator circuitry 100 or 200, only requires one start_fire
conductor between electronic controller 20 and the printhead/printhead
assembly. Thus, the printhead/printhead assembly containing fire pulse
generator circuitry according to the present invention can significantly reduce
the number of fire signal conductive paths to and from the printhead/printhead
assembly.</p>
    <p num="0074">In an example printhead assembly having eight 4-slot color printheads on
a common carrier, the number of required fire signals is reduced from 32 to 1
with the fire pulse generator circuitry according to the present invention. This
not only significantly reduces the number of fire signal conductors necessary in
the electrical interconnect between the electronic controller and the printhead
assembly, but also significantly reduces the number of drivers in the electronic
controller necessary to transmit the fire signals from the electronic controller to
the printhead assembly. In addition, the fire pulse generator circuitry according
to the present invention also significantly reduces the number of pads required
on the printhead/printhead assembly to receive the fire signals. The reduced 
number of fire signal conductors in the electrical interconnect between the
electronic controller and the printhead assembly correspondingly reduces the
amount of undesirable electromagnetic interference (EMI) conducted through
the fire signal conductors. Moreover, in the embodiment where there are
multiple printheads mounted on a carrier to form a printhead assembly, and the
fire pulse generator circuitry is internal to the printheads, the wiring complexity
of the carrier is reduced.</p>
